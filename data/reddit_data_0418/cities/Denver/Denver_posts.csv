Why are ""Native""s the worst? I say ""Native""s because it's mostly the people that have the bumper sticker and start off conversations with they are a ""Colorado native"", which is annoying. ""Hi I'm a native Minnesotan!"" See, nobody cares and I come off arrogant, like Colorado ""Native""s. 

You did nothing to be a Colorado born. It's the equivalent to ""white pride"". To be honest, that's what it sounds like= Ignorant pride. 

Why do I have this opinion? I was hiking Hermans gulch trail near Georgetown and I saw a person throw down their pack and leave about half their garbage at the trail head. I started to pick it up not even saying anything until the couple that threw it on the ground saw me pick it up. I gave them an eye jarring stare, and they looked at my license plate to see that I had moved here from Georgia (even though I had lived in Colorado for ten years prior to that).

The gentlemen then says, ""Need to earn your stripes to the natives, guy."" I said to him, ""Like you?"" And he responded with,""Lived here my whole life, bro."" I just shook my head and picked up the rest of the trash.

I think the GF, was pretty upset because he slapped him on the arm but my opinion of Colorado ""Native""s is this now.

All of us are from the flat Midwest so skiing isn't our strongest, so resorts with diverse slopes would be great!

Are there any ski places that are opened and have skiing past 4PM? 

I was told that Loveland would be great, but before I settle for that I'd like to hear recommendations from locals of course!  
Thanks!",Denver,Best ski resorts for a day trip from Denver?

At 40 miles an hour (many roads in Denver boast that speed limit) a bus can take more than 150 feet to stop, however in pitch black, often times we can't see you until we are within 50ish feet.  Often times to make up for this we try and drive a little slower than the speed limit, or we will slow down when we get to each stop. The problem is, you as the public want us to be in time, so this constant slowing is not always practical.

Do here is the deal, you as a passenger need to take responsibility for your own visibility.  You can do this in a couple days. # 1 use your cell phone. 99% if passengers have one, turn in the flashlight, and wave it at us! #2If you don't have a cellphone, go to the dollar store and buy a super cheap led flashlight! #3 any construction uniform supply store can sell you a reflective vest.

This builder is a big contributor to the Denver FUGLY movement mostly doing scrapes, duplexes and condos wherever they can. This is our second home to purchase and were moving up to accommodate our growing family. I am absolutely fucking pissed about what has happened and that the builder did not stand behind their shitty product or honor their warranty. This is my worst nightmare that has come true and I have no choice but to stand up and fight this builder for 10's-100's of thousands of dollars out of my own pocket...this has already taken a year and a half and will likely take another 1-2 to resolve. Why can't people do what's right and follow through on their promises?

We have major issues with settling around our foundation that caused water to flood my basement, basement slab has heaved and settled and now needs to be busted up and re-poured, our stucco is completely fucked, our balcony has standing water on it, and the list goes on! Before these major issues started to reveal themselves, we were still trying to get our initial punch list done months after closing. Yes, I got an inspection prior to closing but that was clearly not enough as these issues were not caught , but at the same time home inspectors are not engineers, architects, or design experts.

Even after they and I both hired third party engineers and experts evaluate the property and call out defects, they still aren't fixing them! Instead they are throwing up their hands blaming the subcontractors. Man the fuck up, stand by your product and take care of your customers while you deal with your shit subcontractors. This isn't that hard is it? I understand protecting your business from BS frivolous lawsuits but my situation is completely different. I'm pretty sure they thought I couldn't/wouldn't fight this and they rolled the dice trying to bend me over so they could move on to their next shit new build.

Please be warned, if you are buying a new build in the Denver metro area, hire multiple inspectors, a stucco inspector (if you have stucco), AND a structural engineer. Don't end up like me getting bent over by a builder trying to make a buck that could give two shits about delivering a quality product. Their website is total bullshit, their warranty is bullshit and their product is absolute shit. Sure, the finishes make the place look great but that doesn't mean anything if the structure is not sound and the exterior is deficient in keeping water out. It's just lipstick on a pig!

I know this is not a new issue here in Colorado and am aware of the laws and condo Construction Defects. I'd like to hear from other SFH homeowners with similar issues,  I'd like to keep myself, my location, and the builder anonymous so please don't ask.

TL;DR - I'm a homeowner having to sue my shitty local Denver builder because they won't stand behind their product.",Denver,Denver Construction Defects

TLDR: RTD wants to close one of the only routes (fairly heavily utilized by commuters) that gets to the south and east side of the diagonals from the west metro area. This petition could be a springboard to keep the route like it was last time they tried to close it.

I'm hearing a bit about this as someone who lives West of Denver. The W Line is supposedly the ""duplicative service"", but for anyone not traveling to Union Station, but rather going to the center or south of downtown (Denver Health / Civic Center Park areas, for example), this is a non starter. This is the only route that gets there in any reasonable amount of time. Current times for transit from west side via bus are usually around the 25 minute range. Going by Light Rail / Bus change, it's an hour to an hour and a half or more depending where you're going. A non-starter for many folks.

They claim this route is underutilized, but it's a full bus any time I've seen it during commuting hours.

Last time they tried to close this (when they opened the W Line), there was a ton of pushback from the people who ride it and that decision was reversed.

Posting here for those who are on the West side and want to keep this commute option.

Personal opinion? I'd rather they close the W Line most of the time (EG: open only commute times and special event times) and keep the bus route. It's far more utilized at least during commuting hours I've seen it. W Line was poorly located. Great to get to Union Station, but 3 trains (and connection waits) to get to the downtown Welton loop that includes the DCPA / Convention Center as well as the souteast diagonals that aren't served by the 16th street mall ride from Union.

I get they need to make cuts, but this route is a heavily utilized one and it feels like they're trying to push train utilization, which I'd be potentially fine with if it served the people who use this route ... but it doesn't.",Denver,RTD wants to eliminate the 100L (Petition to keep this West Denver route)

United has no separate line for people who are already checked in and simply need to drop luggage.

United’s self-check-in stations are so close together that anyone with more than one piece of luggage encroaches on others.

In our previous town, I started a podcast group, which functioned much like a book club: my group of \~10 girlfriends would get together at the start of each month to talk about a podcast we had all listened to the prior month. Meetups would usually include Sunday breakfast/brunch at someone's home or at a restaurant, and discussion would be lightly guided by prompting questions chosen by that month's ""host."" Each month, a different person would select the next podcast, and would host the next meeting to talk about their chosen podcast. (Not financially hosting, just providing/securing the meeting space.) Podcasts ranged from true crime, to current pop culture, to political history, and everything in between. It was a ton of fun, and the group is still going strong.

I've already got a couple of friends who are interested, but are there any other ladies out there, roughly 25-35 years old, maybe also transplants, who are interested in joining?

Was hoping anyone with any type of input could share. 

I've been struggling with intense cognitive brain fog for about a year now. Some other symptoms include:

\- Declining memory/recall

\- Lack of concentration...finding it tough to stay on certain tasks

\- Struggle to feel present in conversations

\- Lack of excitement...not enjoying things as I used to because of being afraid of how I'm going to feel.   
  Not feeling present during these things..always in my own mind

\- Lack of comprehending/retaining things I've read

\- Lack of clarity

\- Lack of emotion

**A little background:**

I  accepted a job in Oct of 2018 &amp; moved to Colorado in December of 2018 from the Midwest. Something I've always wanted to do and feel like I should be thriving because I finally accomplished it; but the brain fog and other symptoms make it nearly impossible to enjoy myself. I used to be one of the most outgoing people I knew &amp; loved life, but I'm just not feeling myself anymore. Struggle to put myself into social settings because of being in my own mind thinking about how I'm feeling. Always analyzing myself.

Work is going great...although the brain fog definitely impacts my ability at work. But overall the job is going well. I do stare at a computer screen nearly all day, but I did it quite often at my prior place of employment. &amp; I'm making good money which allowed me to move out here. 

Used to be a cannabis user, now it makes these symptoms 100x worse. Drinking alcohol makes it worse. Working out, which I do roughly 4 times a week, makes it worse. &amp; all of these things stink because they were part of who I was/am.

I got a primary care doc after moving out here. I've seen him 3 times now. At first he thought it was anxiety because of the move &amp; also had a tragic family death right before moving out here. However, when I think back, these symptoms started in November of 2018; before the family tragedy &amp; before moving out here, but after accepting the job. I pretty much just ignored them because of how stoked I was to be moving...but they are no long ignore-able &amp; are impacting my daily life. 

After I told the doc I didn't feel like it was anxiety, he said it could be minor ADHD &amp; prescribed me a super low dose of ritalin. Symptoms have still been there, if not worse. I definitely have symptoms of depression, but I cannot tell if the symptoms are a result of the brain fog/cognitive problems I am having or if they are causing them. It's like which came first...the chicken or the egg. I really have no reason to be depressed other than having these issues, which is the part that kills me. As I said, I'm finally doing something I've wanted to do my entire life. Have a great job with a lot of opportunity. Should be thriving...but these things are just limiting me in every aspect of my life.

I eat healthy, workout, &amp; am overall an intelligent individual. But these things are starting to make me feel like I'm not intelligent &amp; have a lack of social skills, which is not my personality at all. I've always been outgoing &amp; have LOVED meeting new people. But these things are dragging me down.

I've got my first appointment with a counselor tomorrow...but I'm worried he will just assume I'm depressed &amp; want to get me on depression meds. I'm not dead opposed, anything that will make this better, but I'm just afraid that's not the case &amp; that its a cognitive issue. Thinking about seeing a neurologist.

Sorry for typing a book....I just was talking to my mother earlier today &amp; she suggested making a post on here to see what input I get back. I'm super open minded and will seriously take any suggestions/considerations to heart. Willing to try anything and everything to get back to being myself; An outgoing, personable, excited, happy person.

Thanks, all.",Denver,Looking for answers...Brain Fog...Jogged Memory...Not feeling Myself

- Content created by the VP of Engineering at [flowhub.com](https://flowhub.com)

- We use meetup to post class details but its not a typical beer/pizza thing (no offense to beer and pizza). We cook and serve food made from scratch on-site and spend all-day going through some well-crafted material from some experienced teachers working in tech right now.

- For Jr to mid-level devs or IT ops looking to augment their skills, or mid-career pros who know they need to up-skill/cross-skill

https://www.meetup.com/sofreeus/events/267124217/ 

Reasons why everyone should include F2F learning for acquiring DevOps tools skills:

- Personal attention.  Expert guidance. A ""team"" experience. For an independent, auto-didactic person these are non-features, but for inter-dependent, pro-social learners they're very important features.

- Learning from an expert is a huge accelerator. Subjectively, it seems to take 5-10x as long to learn a new thing on one's own.

- Tying-it-all-together: I2DO presents a complete production delivery pipeline. Youtube vids probably focus on some part or another, but may not ""tie it all together"", a job for which a novice is particularly un-suited, and which are very much needed for integrated tool chain solutions like CI/CD pipelines.",Denver,Intro To DevOps class w/ GitLab and K8s in Denver 2/15

Me and about 4 of my friends are flying in to Denver, Colorado (DIA) on the night of February 19th and staying until the evening of February 27rd (8 days). We are planning to stay about 30 minutes (or less) away from Echo Mountain, where we plan to go snowboarding the first couple of days we are in town. We were just about done planning the trip when we realized it might be difficult to navigate the roads in the weather conditions that February is likely to bring, especially during the later hours of the day.

When going over some of the car rental companies near DIA, I found that none made any mention of snow tires or chains for driving in snowy conditions. I also found many forums saying that rental companies do not provide either of these two, but do usually provide M/S tires (Mud/Snow) that are in accordance with the traction law ""code 15"". However, seeing that none of us have driven in moderate to severe snowy/icy conditions, we were concerned by whether M/S tires would be enough to drive up the mountain roads from Denver to Echo Mountain.

Do you all remember Groupon? I think Groupon was cool because it got a large crowd to come to a restaurant, but often Groupon charged enough money that it made it financially non-viable for restaurants. 

Thinking about how much customers can help a restaurant, I think it could be really fun to get a roving group of people who go out to eat together at a different restaurant every other weekend. We pick the restaurant and then help them have a great night of serving people and making some money. And we don't charge them! We just eat their food and pay them money. For the introverts, we sit at different tables and just dine like normal, but we all go out and experience this together.

She has moved several times over the last few years and only recently learned about over $700 in toll fines for two vehicles. Original total toll cost was &lt; $200. They are blocking her car registration pending payment.

I understand that some responsibility lies with her in the sense of ""you knew you drove on the toll road, when you didn't see a bill, why didn't you seek one out?""

It seems like the toll company made little / no effort to maintain their information to be current. 

She has left several recorded voicemails in an attempt to reach the promised ""supervisor"", but no one has been calling her back.

479,479,BraveLittleBender,1578714884,en2eum,Nan,"My younger sister (early thirties) lives in Denver, alone.  I live far away on the coast and hardly see her, or communicate with her for that matter. Much to my regret. Over the past several years I have become concerned that my sister suffers from a mixture of anxiety and depression. She's had trouble holding down jobs and keeping contact with friends or family. I fear that she is in a downward spiral. But I truly don't know.

Over the holidays she was meant to fly to my parents place and stay the week. They bought her plane tickets and prepared all the arrangements. The entire family was coming in fact and it was meant to be a week of family time. No doubt to the consternation of my sister. She did not make the flight and when called by my mother she hung up on her and shut off her phone. It was only five days later when my mother left a message saying she was going to call for a wellness check that my sister called back, but remained standoffish, as usual. This was a very upsetting situation for my mother, and it made me extra concerned. I am now convinced she needs some serious help.  This is just small, recent example of her antisocial behaviour. 

During the holiday week I had time to talk privately with my other sister with whom I am much closer, though we too live far apart. We shared many of the same concerns, though I felt more so. We decided that we should both travel to Denver and speak face to face with our sister. Our plane tickets are booked for a three weeks from now.

My request: can anyone recommend a good psychiatrist?  I have no idea how we'll talk our sister into seeing them, but I feel an obligation to try. My sister is a progressive person by default so I hope that gives her some proclivity to the topic. She also smokes pot daily (one of the reasons she's living in Denver). I point this out because it's my opinion she is self medicating. I'd like to get her professional help to possible moderate a better treatment. I want to introduce some positive coping methods to her life and hopefully let her heal whatever is diseasing her mind. She was not always like this.  Any recommendations are welcome.

Thank you kind strangers. Wish I was making my first trip to Denver for the skiing.",Denver,Need a psychiatrist recommendation for my sister

The answer is getting people the services they need to get off the streets, not to let them camp and put themselves and others in harm's way (think about how cold it was last night)...I know it's harder said than done. Services are expensive and sometimes people don't want them. But I think that's the humane thing to do and the right thing for everyone involved. I would be willing to incur an additional tax of some type to pay for more services rather than allow camping. 

I do also see Ms. CdeBaca's point that she doesn't want the city to waste money on lawsuits over this issue although on the other hand it is pretty clear what Denver's citizens want and the government is supposed to be representing us.

Lastly the claims of unconstitutionality under the 8th amendment (which prohibits the cruel and unusual punishment) strike me as contrived and a bigger stretch than a contortionist. If this was appealed I think there is a good chance it would be overturned. I actually wondered whether it might be challenged under the first amendment (freedom of association) but of course there are limits to the first amendment.

Also it seems like this homeless advocate is just headline chasing/clout chasing...at the very least I hope the settlement, as small as it is, goes 100% to homeless people.

One to be picked up from the airport and drive around until our Airbnb is ready. About 3 hours total time. Then again to pick us up in Denver and drive us out to Winter Park for a full day of snowmobiling. Would likely be about 8-10 hour timeframe, due to time we’ll be out on snowmobiles. Ideally we’d have a driver take us around, but we can drive too if better. We’ve contacted multiple “420 tour” type places that offer these rentals, but they are outrageously expensive.

I'm from the east coast and a total goody-two-shoes, so I've had very little exposure to psychedelics besides pop culture.

I have some personal interest, as well; I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation almost all my life, and I understand how frustrating it is to live a life that doesn't seem worth living. If magic mushrooms become a mainstay of treatment modality for mental illnesses, it may significantly change the way we practice psychiatry.

691,691,Dodaddydont,1579154941,epfboo,Nan,"I recently heard about how other cities are effectively combating homelessness in an innovative and inexpensive way.
They are micro housing units called Conestoga Huts. They are durable shelters that provide protection from the elements, safety and dignity to the homeless and bridge the inhumane gap between sleeping outside on the streets and permanent housing. They say the key to success is oversight of the program and a focus on transitioning residents to more permanent housing. The cities that are fighting homelessness in this way have passed laws allowing up to 20 people to sleep in the huts on property managed by a community agency or organization that acts as a site provider, up to 6 huts in parking lots of religious institutions or businesses, and up to 1 hut on private residences. Then the actual living spaces are often created by donors and volunteers for about $2,500 each so the city usually doesn’t have to pay anything for them. The cities only spend a fraction what they would compared to traditional homelessness programs and the streets are cleaner and safer for everyone.

Here is an article on the subject:

News media often states lists unknown information in order to manipulate the actual events that occured.

For example, 9NEWS in Denver recently stated,

“It is not known if Descheenie fired his weapon at the officers.”


When in fact it is well known that this victim did not fire at police and the video that 9NEWS linked to in their article makes this very clear.

In the same article 9NEWS makes two other statements that contradict the story given by police:

“Thomas said officers followed the vehicle and attempted to pull over the driver “


“one Denver officer fired his or her weapon at the man”


When in reality Officer Thomas clearly states in the press release that the vehicle pulled over on its own. The 9NEWS article also fails to mention that in fact an unmarked police car had been following the victim and that undercover plain clothed police had shot the man multiple times.

782,782,Jelfff,1579372245,eqk7jr,Nan,"Over the last couple of weeks I have produced a series of **non-partisan interactive map links that can display political districts**.  This project is a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"". 

One map shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, including **Colorado**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

This morning has been a tragic combination of him being comically hungover and me playing blues clues with whatever his friends remember. 

Unfortunately the “find lost item” Uber function didn’t pan out because (based on my sleuthing) he mistakenly got into the wrong car the first time. I think he left it in this decoy car that doesn’t show up on the app, so I can’t call the driver.

Is this a case where we can demand the entire deposit back, and sue for 3x that amount if he doesn't pay it?

I typed a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/eqnzj5/my_brother_is_stuck_in_a_mental_loop/) on my phone while at the ER with him which explains his condition further. Here's what I know: he overthinks constantly, he's been a THC vaper for about a year now, he takes Alpha Brain vitamins, he's the type of guy who pushes himself to always research and learn. Entering 2020, he has been overworking and overthinking about what he wants to do in his life, this year, this decade.

I saw him on his birthday Thursday, 16th. We had a normal, actual conversation (at least I believed); we created thoughts and ideas. He was slightly on edge, but he had told me he was really fuzzy in the head. The next time I saw him, Saturday 18th, in the ER. He wasn't himself, he was having episodes; however, he was saying the same shit over and over again, the same stuff from Thursday. Same ideas, phrases, rabbit holes. He randomly cries, screams, freaks out too. He's stuck on some mental loophole and can't get out.

But he comes back sometimes, and I can talk to him, see him, but then he can quickly repeats the same shit over and over. A few times we have talked I have been blunt with him and told him; he realizes there is a problem. He has pleaded for help, and has said things such as ""I just can't control it, i won't stop thinking"". Especially when his brain goes idle (awkward silence, he zones out a lot) he relapses, and sometimes harshly.

I would just really like advice on what I, and my family should do. The ER couldn't do much (which is completely understandable); they suggested we see our hospitals' psychiatric team, Kaiser Permanente. Which we hope to do (have to wait to see when we can make an appointment). However, I want the best goddamn help for him and would like to know if anyone has or knows of great psychiatrists who specialize with this weed psychosis or this abnormal psychiatric state.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be staying downtown at the Hyatt Regency, and would prefer to take public transit or B-cycles to get around.  It would be ideal to stay closer to the hotel because I have a full docket for the weekend.   
 

I'm going to try to hit at least a few donut places while I'm there, obviously Voodoo is in the running but I'm sure there are better spots.  I respect all variety of donut styles.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard for me to go anywhere without trying the Barbeque, but so far I haven't heard anyone raving about any 'que spots.  If you have a good spot or if there's a regional style I don't know about, surprise me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really into Chinese cuisine, less American style, more legit Chinese.  I'm really excited about finding foods I can't easily get elsewhere so bonus points for places that specialize in traditional regional styles or that offer a wide palate of textures on the menu.

&amp;#x200B;

I know Denver is a great pizza city, and I've had some good pies there.  If there's a place you're really excited about I'd love to hear about it!

I am looking at purchasing tickets for a show at Red Rocks and it seems that I'm buying a specific seat? I've only been to RR twice, most recently being last year, and the way I remember it was the first 20-30 rows are reserved, with the remaining being open seating.   
At this show, it is split into 11 sections, each having their own specific seat, with the exception of GA being the last 8 or so rows.   


My question is, if I'm buying a ticket in a section with specific seats, am I literally only allowed to be in that spot? I like the flexibility of moving around and wandering and I'd be arriving at the show an hour or so after the show starts. Would I be better off just buying a ticket in the last 8 rows/GA?

988,988,StevenW_,1579774756,esr6cp,Nan,"TLDR: I have a ton of experience with local hospitals in the last 10 years, as an employee and as a patient. For me, the hospital with seemingly the worst reputation has been a total lifesaver (literally), far better than any of the others I have used or worked for. I want to hear from folks who have been to many local hospitals and see how they compare.

Let me preface this with a disclaimer: I'd rather not have a wide ranging discussion about all the problems and politics regarding the clusterfuck that is healthcare in this country. Certainly some key points about our broader national or statewide healthcare problems will be relevant, but I'd like to keep it as non-political and civil as possible. What I'd really like to see is more focused input and experiences with local hospitals and healthcare systems, especially Denver Health.

So, for some perspective, this is where I'm coming from: I'm a very expensive, high-needs patient. Living with intractable epilepsy means I take a ton of medicine, require uber-specialist care, regular exams, frequent emergency care, surgeries, hospital stays, and more.

I came to Denver in 2010 from an eastern state, one that was (and still is) pretty much in shambles, with zero jobs, public health crises, environmental disasters, and terrible access to healthcare (hint: it rhymes with ""Best Murjinya""). Within a few weeks of arriving, I secured a good job in the IT department of Centura health office in Englewood. They would pay me well and provide health insurance to be accepted at Centura hospitals. The nearest Centura hospital and neurology clinic was at Porter Adventist Hospital, so I found a PCP and neurologist based there.
Even with insurance and in network care at the same hospital system I worked for, I made zero progress in my treatment. I may as well have stayed in BFE where the only doctor available just kept rotating my medications with zero results or progress. Despite my hopes, my care in Denver was expensive and inefficient as fuck, to hell with the benefit I was promised of getting good care there due to my status as a networked employee.

A year or so after I started working for Centura (part of CHI), we got news that our IT department was being outsourced and we'd all be out of jobs soon. During my last week of commuting there, I had an awful accident where I had a seizure while waiting for the train, landed face first on the concrete, and woke up in the ER at Denver Health. It was the first time I'd ever been there and I was immediately seen by an epileptologist (I had no idea that was a thing). My first concern was my bill, since I had found out that I'd soon be losing my job and insurance, and there was no way I could pay for that ER visit, much less advanced care. The epileptogolist told me not to worry about it, he wanted me to come back and not worry about insurance. I got some stitches for my injuries and was scheduled for appointments with the epilepsy clinic. In 30 years of having epilepsy and dozens of doctors and hospitals, I never had the luxury of going to an entire clinic devoted to epilepsy. Most times you see a neurologist or neurology clinic who treats epilepsy, among other neurological problems. 

Shortly thereafter, I was approved for unemployment benefits and Medicaid following the layoffs. Not to worry, I was told, the Denver Health epilepsy clinic would accept Medicaid or find some way to treat me.

Over the next few months I would be collecting unemployment and looking for new work (the economy was still pretty shitty at the time). During this time I also had many appointments and became quite familiar with the epilepsy clinic and other departments at Denver Health. I made more progress in 3 months on Medicaid going to this ""safety net"" hospital than I had in 15 years of traveling to doctors and facilities back east who were supposed to be top notch and paid under my parents' insurance.

I went back to work for another healthcare IT department, this time for Exempla hospitals (now known as SCL Health). Again, I was told I would have access to good insurance that would get me care at local Exempla Hospitals, which includes Good Samaritan, Lutheran, and St Joseph's. Because of this, I would be kicked off Medicaid and not qualify for care at Denver Health because I made too much money and had ""good"" insurance through my employer.

Back on private insurance, I returned to seeing a regular neurologist and having exams at SCL facilities. They would look at my history and the vibe I got was just kind of a shrug of the shoulders and passive mentions of advanced treatments of brain surgery and newer medical devices that might be some kind of a possibility at some point far down the road. Out of pocket costs for such treatments would range from $35k - $40k and require travel between facilities. 

After 2 years, I was offered a similar but better job for HealthOne (HCA) whose local hospitals include Swedish, North Suburban, Presbyterian/St Luke's, Rose, Skyridge, and Medical Center of Aurora. Again, I hoped to use my network to secure good healthcare at any of these facilities and their neurologists, but they were all mediocre at best, especially compared to my experience at the Denver Health epilepsy clinic. I stayed in that job and with that care for 2 years before enrolling in grad school at CUD. As an independent student with a part time job, I was again eligible for Medicaid and resumed my care at the Denver Health epilepsy clinic. 

I've had the most advanced care of my life there, including neuro surgeries, medical devices, and psychiatric care, and much of it has been successful and very affordable. All the other local hospitals and clinics I've been to just seemed to drag on and on with no progress and very little interest from physicians, not to mention exorbitant costs. A procedure that would have cost me $40k as an employee for HCA was free when I was a student on Medicaid at Denver Health. I waited and waited and paid and paid out the ass for years at SCL, HCA, and Centura hospitals and their clinics around Denver with little progress. But my treatment moved so fast and was so much better and successful at this hospital that is supposedly just a ""safety net"", one that is partially funded by local taxes (Hancock was pushing funding for it as part of a tax increase that passed a few years ago, I can't remember the name of the bill).

Denver Health seems to have a reputation as a mediocre hospital for the poorest, most desperate people in town. Maybe I am desperate for care because I can't survive without it, but I'm not impoverished or unemployed, (except when I was laid off in 2011 and when I was working part time as a grad student a few years ago). The Wikipedia article about Denver Health declares in the intro that the hospital's ER department is nicknamed ""the knife and gun club"". Well, aside from that being a lousy inclusion into a Wiki intro, I've never heard that nickname and I've been a patient there for years, including several trips to their ER. Do folks really say that?

If I Google ratings for hospitals in Denver, UCHealth Aurora usually ranks the highest (I've only been there once for a special kind of MRI, so I can't opine), then Porter and Skyridge are also highly ranked. The hospitals that I had the worst experiences with as a patient are all highly rated, while Denver Health isn't even mentioned on many of those lists, even though my care there was in a league of its own in terms of price, accessibility, and results. 

I know that different hospitals have their strengths and weaknesses from one department to the next. And certainly I have had some not so amazing experiences at Denver Health. Not all hospitals can specialize in everything. Some hospitals have departments that are amazing and others that are really lacking, I know. My experiences are mostly limited to being an epilepsy patient. I've been taken to the ER via ambulance to 5 different hospitals (Swedish, Porter, St Anthony, Denver Health, and Medical Center of Aurora). My experiences with ambulances and ERs have been mostly the same at each facility.

I'm curious what folks think of different hospitals as patients, and particularly compared to Denver Health. Is that really the ""knife and gun club"", do you see it as a low quality ""welfare hospital""? 

(PS: Of course, the VA hospital in Aurora is a whooooooole nother discussion and I know many folks have a lot to say about that, but for the sake of discussion let's limit this to non-VA facilities)",Denver,"Experiences with Denver Health, other hospitals.

The important info: We are planning on coming in July for a long weekend. 2 of us are from NorCal and 2 from the Northeast, meeting in Denver as a central location we've all wanted to go to (never left the airport before). I've done some Googling but hopeful to get some local insight since we are currently looking for an AirBnb. We'll be looking to do some of the following if anyone has any tips: 

* neighborhoods to stay in for good food and decent nightlife
* outdoor activity (maybe moderate hike)
* best brewery(s) to visit
* best distillery to visit
* any strip clubs worth the debauchery? 
* places to avoid, like tourist traps or the like?

For program requirements this semester, I am only looking for people who need a ‘deep cleaning’ to remove hardened tartar/build-up that can’t be brushed off. You'd need to go to a free, half-hour screening appointment at the school first for us to determine your deposit load; this appointment cannot happen on the same day as a cleaning. If you end up having the deposit type I need, I would be willing to pay your fees. (This is about a $100 value at my school clinic. These deep cleanings cost over $1000 at a regular dental clinic.) 

Appointments are on Mondays and Wednesdays only. Because we students cover many extra steps in our learning process and move more slowly, and because every step must be checked by staff, appointments last from 3-4 hours, though I'm not in your mouth that whole time! You'd bring a book or something for downtime. Deep cleanings have to be divided into more than one appointment, even in a regular dental clinic. So yes, there is a time commitment, but if you are ok with that, you will get an extremely cheap cleaning and wonderfully comprehensive assessment of your mouth. You will receive x-rays and be examined by our dentist too.

I posted here before about camping groups etc. to go out with in Denver and I’m currently working on those through meetup, but until I get settled into those, I’d like to do some day hikes in the mountains, mainly just to acclimate to the altitude and get a feel for my pace and stuff.

I’m currently looking at the Vail bus, which runs through Idaho springs and Dillon/Frisco. I don’t know those locations too well beyond having driven through them when I was here a couple years ago, but theoretically, could I take the Vail-bound Bustang line to one of these locations, get off, maybe take an Uber or something if necessary to get to a trailhead, and just start hiking?

Is this an accurate price range? or should we expect to spend more? id prefer to move into a new building as long as they are actually this affordable. We are coming from New York City and for us this is a very practical price range by comparison.

So about 6 months ago my husband and I filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy (a type of filing where you get a payment plan to pay off your debts) because of unmanageable medical bills. We're currently apartment hunting and everyone says ""no bankruptcies."" The fact that our filing is the type where you DO pay off your bills doesn't seem to matter to them. 

It feels like landlords would rather people just dodge their creditors and skip out on bills instead taking steps to manage their finances after a major setback. We haven't missed a rent payment in the 4 years we've lived at our current place (though our current landlord is really unhappy with us because we reported not having hot water for a month to the city) and have no evictions from the past. We also make too much for low income housing. 

Does anyone have any advice for us?",Denver,Renting with a Chapter 13?

Did you know two of the VanTrapp singing kids joined up and trained at Camp Hale?
A popular spot for leave was the Brown Palace Hotel, where the soldiers would often tie off their newly invented nylon climbing ropes and rappel down to the lobby.
The \""ski troops\"" were very popular and had several movies filmed there and were constant fodder for magazine covers.
Many famous climbers and Olympic skiers joined on.
Most Coloradans know how these guys came back and created the modern ski areas, but the opposite happened as well; many owners and instructors of already existing ski areas left to join the war effort.and train/teach there in Eagle Valley

Today I went to renew my vehicle registration online, and I was hit with an HTTPS spoofing attack, which attempted to infect my Windows PowerShell.

Be aware that the MYDMV \[dot\] Colorado \[dot\] GOV website is a secure (HTTPS) site. When you access the page on Chrome, you should see the little lock to the left of the address on the address bar.

HTTPS spoofing is when somebody blocks the secure connection, causing it to become an insecure HTTP connection, and tries to get in the middle of you and the web server (Man In The Middle Attack). Doing so allows them to capture traffic between you and the server (e.g. credit card info), and push malware down to your computer. 

Make sure the connection to the Colorado DMV website is secure before entering any personal information, and if your browser warns you that the connection is \*not\* secure, do not continue to the website.

I’m 24 and have been thinking of Denver as a top choice as I see how many millennials move there. But, I was wondering how nightlife is. Is it a social area with things open later into the night? Or is the city pretty quiet and most are just kind of vegging out after 9?

I’m working remotely so need to be around a lot of people my age and opportunities/groups. I’d like to get into the outdoorsy stuff, but I just want to see if the city nightlife is fun and if there’s a lot to do - or if it’s quieter and I’ll see everything I need to quickly.

The only people who will be able to get there are travelers who already went through security. They are going to be eager to get on the train and get to their gate. For those with layovers in Denver, very few will walk back to the train to take it to the main terminal.

I've experienced private high rise views but I've been wondering if Denver has anything similar to say, like the Empire State Building how you can pay to go up some height for a view of the city from within the city.


Here's a couple stories! 
I live Uptown and I was invited once to the penthouse in my building for a holiday party, but only had a few minutes before I had to get somewhere else. The view was incredible, and at night. I've seen high rise views during the day as well. When I was 17 wore a suit and entered Republic Plaza, got on the elevator with a couple people and pressed a random button that hadn't been hit. To my luck everyone got off before me, and to my amazement the floor was empty. Offices with no desks, break rooms with no coffee, and curtain less windows all around. The 360 view of Denver was something else, and being able to suck it all in, was just special. A'Las I made sure not to overstay my visit, and left. My intentions were to find some offices and claim I was looking for this company but get a view from stories up while alluding suspicion. Lol similarly I went in once with my normal clothing and a skateboard and was asked to leave before I even got to the elevator. Got to love it!",Denver,Any public high rise views of Denver?

I have been with MHCD for what feels like almost four years as well as 2Succeed ever since I left the disappointing Job Corps who had no idea what to do. After all the time in both MHCD and Job Corps care my father heard what was happening and wanted me to write down everything that happened between them both and go after them with legal action, but I figured that it would be a pointless venture to go after them both as I did get free room and board from the both of them during my stay no matter how inconsistently I got food from either party.

However, this post is about MHCD and whether I can sue them for medical malpractice and if anyone knows a lawyer who will help take on a class-action lawsuit for a portion of what may be won. I like many others come in to see if MHCD will help them find some kind of purpose in life as well as to find a place to finally call home for a short window and after a long while of living in their housing program I am being pressured and yelled at to move out after I was bullied into signing the lease on an apartment that I didn't want. What happened prior to signing the lease was I signed a few wavers that let my case-manager (that I didn't get till two and a half years ago) help me find a place where she immediately passed the buck onto a separate group who wouldn't give me a concrete place to meet them or where the apartment was or what floor I was on till after I finally signed some paperwork that allowed DHA to inspect the apartment and THEN I saw the apartment and didn't like the points of ingress one bit to which I tried to tell my case manager but as usual didn't get a call back from her till she needed me to sign the lease on the apartment like she didn't get my messages or listen to them at all. At the lease signing, I was trying to air my concerns but they were mostly blown off or met with ""this is a prime location"", ""you can keep a bike behind this door that leads directly outside"" (like it won't get immediately stripped), ""you can just go to Voodoo Donut's whenever"", ""if you don't sign it you'll lose the voucher"". Currently, I am trying to get her to see things from my point of view and help me find a place nearer where I was offered more consistent work than the one part-time job I have now but it seems like I'm just beating my head against a brick wall as she just wants me to shut up and take the place (not said directly but heavily implied).

I would go more into what MHCD has done to not help not only me but probably a lot of other people, but I wanted to get this post out with the question that's been plaguing my mind since I was told I had a week to leave (implied: or get thrown the fuck out).

I’m much more of a lurker here on Reddit but I’ve seen what the community does so I reckon it’s worth a shot posting.

My family was relocated to the Denver area 2 years ago by my company, and we love it here. It’s myself, my wife, and our kids 3 and 1.5 yrs old. So far we have received a fantastic welcome to this lovely part of the world.

For the last 6 months my wife has been looking for work. She’s a PA with experience in orthopedic surgery and urgent care, plus a little bit of a few other areas. Very few calls back and 2 interviews that decided to go with other candidates. She has a valid CO license and is ready to work.

Problem is, this lack of work is really taking an emotional toll on her. My 1.5 yr old is a higher needs child and is wearing her out. My 3yr old is getting bored at home. And my wife is being torn apart by the instability all this is causing.

I make reasonable money, but not quite enough to pay for childcare if my wife isn’t working. Before we moved, we all found that my older child does fantastically with child care- interacting with other kids and a change of scenery, and my younger loves the drop-in daycare we’re scrounged up cash for a few times. My wife just does much better as a working mom than as a stay at home mom. Moral of the story is, if my wife is working, we will all be happier.

But in the current situation, we are hitting hard emotional times. It’s really rough home life right now. I know this is the solution, we just can’t seem to get to it.

So... does anyone have any leads? Anyone know who to contact? Please help us be a happy family again. I just don’t know what else to do.

I'm excited to be moving to Denver (Sloans Lake / Dry Gulch Lightrail area) later this month, from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Since I'll be driving a 16 or 20 foot moving truck, would it be advisable to avoid the mountains and potential snow of Highway 70 and take the much longer way by driving north (CO-13) and then west (Interstate 80) through Wyoming and (25 South) to Denver?

This long detour should take 4+ more hours.....if anyone is familiar with the routes, will it actually be that much safer? And all lower elevations?

Thank you!  For any and all advice    :)

And in advance for any haters of ""invading"" Californians......I do understand and will try my best to be a good neighbor!

I'm coming from Austin, TX - and it doesn't snow there. I've spent a lot of time in ohio, so I can handle snow, but I've only driven around in a 4wd. 

My most urgent ""concern"" is just regarding driving in snow in a FWD Mazda 6. 

Should I add antifreeze to my fluids (I can feel your eyes rolling)? The great debate on snow tires.. chime in! Staying warm, heating/electricity costs, anything you can think of that would be useful for a newcomer.

I already got an email from United saying that weather might impact my flight, but I’m going to see if I need to reschedule my flight all together. Would be super helpful to know in advance.

But that goes into why I need help... For what it's worth- I'm a 25 year old female. I was taking the C train to union station and an intoxicated man was stumbling around and sitting/standing/flopping around in the seats facing me, there was some empty space between us thank god. I tried my best to stare intently out of the window be he kept stumbling right up into my face talking about sucking his dick. Talking shit to some other folks around me as well. I'm not from a big city and have never been in such an encounter where i felt so trapped. I was against the far wall with nowhere else to go. Eventually when he got in my face I just said ""you're scaring me"" he said ""sorry sorry"" and backed up a little. About 30 seconds later continues on about me sucking his dick and how he always scares white people. Like- you're not scaring me because you're black, but because you're talking about me literally sucking your dick and saying ""FUCK you, you fucking BITCH"" 

Right before we got to union station this absolute legend- probably a dude my age, made his way to the front and said ""man shut the fuck up"". The drunk guy acted like he wanted to fight and the legend said ""don't you fucking touch me"". 
That's when the train arrived and i ran off like my ass was on fire.

Is there any appropriate way to deal with this kind of thing? I was really excited about the trains, but i may stick to lyft at this point. Are some trains prone to aggressive people that i should avoid, or was I just unlucky? The 3 times I rode the A train things went really well.

Meaning no points, you just pay court fees equal to the fine but the moving violation is cancelled. You can also go to traffic school and pay for the fine and  traffic school, and the moving violation will be canceled (a little extra for traffic school is better than paying higher insurance premiums for several years).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Colorado’s infrastructure is reaching a critical crossroads. As the Centennial state’s population grows-- thanks in part to our abundant sun and outdoor recreation-- the infrastructure we depend on is suffering from years of under-investment. As a result, our schools, roads, bridges, sewer lines, water treatment facilities, and many other critical assets are failing to keep pace with the needs of our growing state.

The American Society of Civil Engineers’ Colorado Section is hoping to change that with the release of the Colorado Infrastructure Report Card. The report card will serve as an advocacy tool to encourage smart public and private investments in Colorado’s infrastructure. Over two dozen ASCE members VOLUNTARILY  co-authored the report. The 2020 grades (compared to the 2010 grades) are as follows:

 

|Category|2010 Grade|Trend|2020 Grade|

|Wastewater|C| ↓ |C-|

Colorado ASCE’s chapter has not issued a report card since 2010, and it’s high time citizens of our state receive an updated assessment and list of priorities from its civil engineers.

Infrastructure spending serves a greater purpose of ensuring we have things like safe roads to access our great outdoors, state of the art schools to educate our children, and transmission lines to access cleaner, renewable sources of energy. With the recent defeat of Prop CC, the CO Infrastructure Report Card will serve as a timely talking point for CO policy makers and voters.

It’s important that civil engineers have a voice in public policy, because few people understand our infrastructure needs better. Brian Pallasch, who served as ASCE’s Managing Director of Government Relations, said it best: “If civil engineers aren’t talking about infrastructure, who is?”

Additionally, stop driving near other drivers. ESPECIALLY on the highway. I've noticed everyone likes to herd together and drive 25mph while having one car length between cars. And also blocking all the lanes in one big wall of cars. Stop doing this. BE SAFE, STAY AWAY FROM OTHER CARS. increase your follow length to at least 10 car lengths and DO NOT PACE THE CARS NEXT TO YOU. 

Also, buy snow tires or all weathers. This is important for going up hills at low speeds. If you have them, its quite easy, but if you don't, the key to getting up hills in snowy weather is maintaining momentum. Stop slowing to 15mph when you get to hills. Try to maintain as much speed as you can going up the hill without spinning the tires. To not spin your tires, let off the gas and just coast up the hill with your momentum. You should be able to steer while coasting. Applying gas or breaking while turning will usually cause problems. Just chill out and ride the wave. All you have to do is point your car the way you want to go. Be gentle and do not overreact.

My husband and I (we are both 24) have been thinking about moving to Colorado for the longest time. We currently live in Ohio and hate just about everything about it here - from weather to boring scenery and zero things to do.   


Either of us have a college degree so as of right now we both work entry level jobs, meaning we don't have huge savings but we obviously planned on saving as much as possible before making the final decision to move. We also both plan on eventually attending a community college in Colorado (once we're considered residents over there).   


Now my questions lol.   


1. How much money do you think is ideal to save before moving to CO (most likely Denver)? We've done some research about how expensive it is, but I'd like to know your personal experience. 
2. Is it fairly easy to find a decently paid job in Denver? We would ideally like to find something prior to us moving there (we have family in CO so we could possibly even fly in for interviews etc). I have most experience working with kids (daycare, nanny etc.) and my husband has a lot of experience working in IT. 
3. How expensive is renting (1bed/1bath or 2bed/1bath) in Denver? And also what locations should we look into so we have a good chance of finding a decent job not too far from our apartment and having a nice enough neighborhood as well. 
4. Pros and cons of living in Colorado in General and living in Denver specifically? 

I'm not entirely sure if I covered everything I wanted, I'm sure I'll think of more questions later but this is probably it for now. Thanks for your reactions!",Denver,"Young married couple moving from OH to Denver, CO"

1779,1779,unctuous_equine,1581138262,f0myar,Nan,"Hi guys, I'm getting ready to buy some wholesale garden seeds, and am looking for 2 other people who would be interested in splitting the cost 3 ways. The cost would come out to about $50 and you'd get 380 seeds from 19 different plants specifically bred for our climate.

I've been doing some maximizing on plants that do well in Denver, and have compiled a list of plant seeds I want to buy thanks to resources from the Denver Botanical Gardens and Plant Select, which works with universities and nurseries in the region to cultivate varieties that do well here. [Here is a link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1byj-d2OSlXZeeDHka7ZbHCFj_JGsDEBqulwKSpaJGsE/edit?usp=sharing)to a google spreadsheet I made where you can see the plants and decide if you're interested. In the spreadsheet, the Plant Select link will open a photo of the plant in question. 

In order to keep the logistics manageable, I'm not up to making significant changes to the shopping list. If you want a couple of the ones listed but not the others, please don't PM me. I'm looking for people who like what they see and are down with getting all or almost all of these, just to keep the ordering simple. The nice thing is that all of these plants are specifically selected for our climate, so they should thrive.

The way wholesale seed ordering works is the seller doesn't count out each single seed, but instead sells them by weight, calculating roughly how many seeds are in a given weight. For most of the plants in the spreadsheet, the estimate is 50 seeds, so split among 3 people you'd get \~15 seeds for each plant. 

If you're interested, PM me that you want in, and I'll send you my Venmo info. Once we've all chipped in, I'll order the seeds. Once they've arrived, I figured we can meet at a park or at the Botanical Gardens or somewhere and divide up the seeds. Some seeds arrive in clumps and have twigs, plants debris etc that need to be sorted through, and as I said the counts aren't exact. I also don't see any way around you paying me before I order the seeds, and I understand if this makes you nervous. I can only say that this is not an elaborate reuse to scam you out of 50 bucks. I just like gardening, and want to buy seeds at wholesale prices without getting thousands of them. Cheers!",Denver,Want to go in with me on some wholesale garden seeds?

1783,1783,myco-naut,1581146046,f0o8zv,Nan,"I'm fortunate enough to be affluent. I was born into a trust fund and have bounced around trying to cure my boredom. The past 2 years I've kept my primary residency here in Thornton and have used this as a hub for my travels.

I found in my travels that people are fascinated with Denver. After a while i stopped going out and dove into the city. I did all the foodie endeavors (shout out to Blue Pan and Linger as the go-to in town). I dove into the psychedelic scene but got tired of the wook culture that dominates it. Checked out the car scene but got tired of the pretentiousness. Finally, I started hanging out with homeless people.

Wow... What a community. I can't describe the sense of belonging they give me. I've been at 136th/Colorado for 2 years and don't know one of my neighbors by name. I've been hanging out with homeless people for the past month and I have a family.

Before I entered this endeavor I made some ground rules for my protection. 1 being that I always carry protection. You don't know how dramatic the variables can get when dealing with addicted mentally ill people. I also never reveal anything about myself. I've never even given my name... People just came up with my nickname Red (I wear a big fluffy warm red coat).

The people I connect with, I take care of but not in a way to give myself away. I give away A LOT of psilocybin capsules. I rent cheap hotels on occasion if someone expresses their longing to get clean. I truly believe a hot shower is akin to an orgasm when this dry weather has you itching like a crackhead. Multiply that by actually being a crackhead and man does it feel amazing...

Anyway, don't want nothing from you. This isn't a humble brag as I probably take more from it than I give. Just wanna let you know if you're lonely, you don't have to be.",Denver,I own a home in Thornton but have been slumming on 16th street mall for the past 4 weeks.

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, or if I’ve missed another thread that answered my question. I saw similar topics, but not quite the question I had. 

I’m from Australia, and getting married in Aspen in July. My fiancée is originally from Denver, but we have lived in Australia for five years. We live at sea level. I’ve been to the Colorado mountains a few times (Vail, Aspen, Estes etc.) and only had some mild nausea and fatigue. Certainly felt puffed at times, but it was fine except for a tough bout of nausea at a Jimmy John’s in some place called Dillon? Or Dylan? Can’t remember. 

We’ll be in Aspen for a week before the wedding, so I’m comfortable I’ll be able to acclimatise to that fairly easily. I’ll ask my doctor for some Diamox, headache and nausea pills, and drink plenty of water, not drink much etc. I’m actually more worried about the week after. 

We’ve been offered a beautiful log cabin near Alma for our honeymoon from some close friends. They’re offering to pay for a week there, which is just so lovely. It looks amazing, but I’m concerned about the altitude. 

I did fine at 8,000, but 11,000ft seems like a lot! Will it be really hard to adjust to that? Or will it be made easier by the fact that I’ll be at 8,000ft for the week beforehand? I know these things are different from person to person, but will there ever be any risk of needing to descend at 11,000ft? Or will it perhaps just take a day or so to adjust? I’m 32 and not that fit, but not horribly out of shape either. 

I guess I just don’t want to accept such a lovely offer, only to have to descend because I can’t adjust to 11,000ft. 

Thanks a lot.",Denver,Altitude Sickness in the Mountains

I was originally in the process of moving to Denver with my old college roommate, we’re both from Florida but not really very Floridian in mindset so we thought this would be a good change. I went to visit another friend of mine over the summer to check the city out and genuinely didn’t enjoy the city at all. To much build up and the feeling that city doesn’t even really know what their doing with it. The city just seems very desolate almost borderline dystopian in my opinion. I just really couldn’t find anything appealing about it. I told my old roommate how i felt and he essentially spazzed on me telling me how spending a week out there is a horrible way to get an opinion on a city and that he doesn’t have to go see it before he moves cause he knows he’ll enjoy it. Sooo essentially was there something I missed? I seem to be my only friend that doesn’t like Denver. For context I spent most of my time in Lakewood, downtown and capital hill.

1970,1970,thedactyl8,1581525325,f2tv7n,Nan,"**for those that dont want to read the full review, here are the cliff notes: unreliable website, great customer service, same great service as Verizon network**

I looked all over Reddit and the Internet for reviews on the new Visible Wireless provider in Denver and did not find much, so I wanted to leave a review. I'm sure there is someone out there who is as curious as I was.

I was with Cricket Wireless for about 6 years, and loved them, except the fact that they ran on AT&amp;T network (and we all know that AT&amp;T service is terrible in Denver). Visible Wireless advertised to have the same great perks as cricket (no contract, pre paid $40/month) but runs on the Verizon network, so Visible sparked my interest.

After visiting their website, I found out that they do not have any physically stores and everything is set up through their website. Being a millennial, this did not scare me. Via the setup instructions on the website, it seemed like a simple process.
1. You pick the phone you want (the one you already own, or select a new one you can order on the website) If you order a phone through them, they will ship it overnight on the next business day
2. provide old carrier account number so they can transfer your phone number over to them (or get a new phone number)
3. Once your phone/visible SIM card arrives, pop in the sim card in the phone and activate your service via the website

It is a great process...if the website actually worked.

I started this process on Saturday. I decided to get a new phone through their website, but keep my phone number. When I purchased the phone on their website my payment was rejected because my bank flagged it as fraud. I received an email saying that my order was rejected, however my order status on the website still said that my order was complete and on its way. I contacted their customer services via chat convo available on the visible app. I didn't have to wait long at all until I was connected with a customer service agent, who was very helpful. I explained my situation and the agent put in a ticket to delete my phone order that was denied, but said it would take 24-48 hour for it to be deleted. Once the order was deleted I could reorder the phone. 

It is now Sunday and I have received an email saying that my order has been deleted and I am good to place another order, but now there is a problem with getting my phone number transfered over to them. They said that my account number with my old carrier wasn't correct and was delaying the transfer. I ordered the phone again on their website, and that went through fine this time, and said it would be delivered on Tuesday. And then contacted their customer service via chat again about the phone number transfer. They had me verify the account number again, which was the exact number I put in the first time, and told me that number was still coming back as incorrect. The agent then had me call my old carrier to confirm the account number, and it was indeed the exact number I had been giving them the whole time. The agent was very helpful and said she would call my old carrier herself to get it figured out.

On Monday I received an email saying that my phone number had been successfully transfered and I was good to activate my service once my phone arrived, but it wasn't arriving til the next day.

On Tuesday my phone arrived and I put in the SIM card and my phone was activated with no problems.

So in conclusion, the whole processes took 4 days for me to get activated. I will say that I thought the customer service was excellent though. Both times I had to contact customer service during this process, I didn't have to wait long at all and the agents were very helpful and solved each problem. Since this is a fairly new provider, I am sure they will get their website kinks resolved eventually.

I have been using Visible for about 24 hours now and have no complaints about the service. I will try to provide updates as time passes!",Denver,Visible Wireless Review

We're all in our early 20s, so I'd like to be close to downtown/nightlife/things to do, but would be willing to commute for the right place. What neighborhoods would you recommend (or even better, specific buildings/management companies)? Also, is there anything that we should check out while we're there?",Denver,Advice on places to live?

For a bit of background, my coworkers all week have been telling me to check out the mall downtown and walk around. So tonight being my last night, I figured I’d walk around a bit. I’m also an idiot who didn’t think to check and make sure that the stores would still be open, but to my credit every mall I have ever been to doesn’t close until 9. Anyways, I’m walking around and as I’m coming towards the Bath and Body Works side of the “mall”, this homeless man pops up and starts walking towards me and whistles and yells something at me that I didn’t catch. At that point I’m over it and turn around to go back the other way and head home and this mutherfucker starts screaming at me and picks up his speed walking after me. “Fuck you dumb bitch. You think you’re too fucking good for me. I’m gonna fucking show you. You stupid fucking bitch.” Screaming the same shit over and over again. I was trying to walk fast, but it’s slippery and he was really gaining speed on me. I luckily ran into some girls while I was trying to get away and told them what was happening and we sprinted the other way and lost him. I was just going to go straight home, but I walked by a cop car and debated and figured it didn’t hurt to say something to him. He was nice, but acted like this was completely normal?!?!??!?? I live in a city that’s a top 30 in population and very far from being a small town, but if I ever knocked on a cop’s window and said some angry guy was chasing and screaming at me right in the middle of uptown, it would be a big deal.

2005,2005,sugartank7,1581607894,f3bn0n,Nan,"I’m Alexa, a dental hygiene student looking for patients to clean in our school clinic in Lowry, Denver. For program requirements this semester, I am only looking for people who need a ‘deep cleaning’ to remove hardened tartar/build-up that can’t be brushed off. You'd need to go to a free, half-hour screening appointment at the school first for us to determine your deposit load; this appointment cannot happen on the same day as a cleaning. If you end up having the deposit type I need, I would be willing to pay your fees at the school. (These deep cleanings cost over $1000 at a regular dental clinic.)

Appointments are on Mondays and Wednesdays only. Because we students cover many extra steps in our learning process and move more slowly, and because every step must be checked by staff, single appointments last from 3-4 hours, though I'm not in your mouth that whole time! You'd bring a book or something for downtime. Deep cleanings must be divided into more than one appointment, even in a regular dental clinic, and, just as at a regular dental clinic, frequently require numbing. So yes, there is a time commitment, but if you are ok with that, you will save tons of money and receive a wonderfully comprehensive assessment of your mouth. You will receive x-rays, fluoride treatment, and be examined by our dentist too.

Send me a note for more info.",Denver,"Need a deep dental cleaning, but can't afford it? Try a student hygienist..."

Fairs at farms in Virginia farm country, wineries, etc. Of course lots of hiking and kayaking but we know we'll find that in Colorado in spades. 

Is there a lot to do with young kids in Denver? Are there cultural performances, family friendly festivals, etc? I think this is our biggest hesitation, so I'd love to hear any firsthand experiences. I know the mountains are beautiful but we cannot realistically take our kids skiing every weekend, especially at their current ages, so I'm worried we will be bored. What is life like with little kids in Denver? TIA!",Denver,How's life with kids in Denver?

Please comment here or send a PM if you're interested and we can go from there. Doesn't have to be limited to movie theaters.

Last few movies we saw in theaters:  Candyman (midnight at Esquire), Midnight Family (Sie), Rowdy Cats screening (Alamo), Color Out of Space (Alamo), Queen and Slim (UA Pavilions), Parasite (Chez Artiste), The Lighthouse, Terminator 2, Joker, Once Upon a Time, Ad Astra.

I GTFO of there immediately and found a legit event parking lot near St. John's cathedral, where the parking attendant there warned me the concert parking at Wendy's is basically a scam that will tow your car if you park there. Other people have had similar experiences with this operation, I have no idea why it's still operating in plain sight and straight up ripping people off. DO NOT GO THERE!!! 

I guess I have the random fight that broke out to thank for not getting my car towed but the whole experience was so surreal and unpleasant.

I'm emailing it to the relevant Councilmembers too (those who either voted ""no"" on the original bill or weren't present for that vote so IDK how they'll vote this time), but wanted to put it out publicly as well for visibility and also to add to the discourse and hopefully change some views.*  


\~\~\~\~\~\~  


Dear Councilmembers Flynn, Kashmann, Ortega, Sawyer, Gilmore, &amp; CdeBaca;

I figure it's safe to assume that you've all already been met with a great deal of testimony about the science of breed behavior, and also data about how breed-specific legislation doesn't actually yield more than a thin false veneer of safety or compliance, and also logic about how pit bull attack rates are a *product* of institutionalized flawed mechanics (including BSL). I have trust that you've put in a good faith effort to weigh the facts that are readily available.

But I'm really disappointed and concerned to see that, so far, those facts don’t appear to have moved the Council to be reliably broadly in favor of repealing the ban. So, I figured it might be useful to discuss some of the nuances that build the foundation of these criticisms, and expand on some of the secondary and tertiary implications of these irrational, impractical, and downright dangerous laws.

  
\--

**BSL \*Causes\* Irresponsible Ownership Decisions**

Some years back, I worked for Westwood Animal Hospital. At the time, there was a total staff of five, and I was the only person there under the age of 60, so I wore many hats and took on a great deal of responsibility for office management and front-end client interaction, including client education and improving client compliance. The clinic was (and remains) extraordinarily busy, and is located (as you might have guessed) in Westwood. This gave me a usefully direct grounding in the kinds of stigmas, misinformation, confusion, and fearful beliefs that impact pet owners all across the city and surrounding areas, particularly those pet owners who are low-income, minority, and/or otherwise in underprivileged groups.

*Many people who are eager to be compliant with the law, and eager to take good care of their pets, are terrified to take pit bulls to Denver-area vets and/or to any vets at all.* This is essentially for the same reason that many people are afraid to confess drug use to their emergency department physicians: Ignorance of the fact that medical care providers aren't part of some network of authority figures who are all out to report lawbreakers. The lowest common denominator of client does not necessarily know where the ban applies and where it doesn't, or even if they do, many of them can't transport their pets to see vets in other cities. I can't begin to count the number of calls I fielded from worried owners who wanted to get vaccinations for their dogs, and wanted to come to us because we were their local vet (or because they were recommended to the illustrious Dr. Bay by her loyal fans), but were afraid that perhaps their pit bulls/mixes couldn't legally get services in Denver, or at all. Many people legitimately believe that it's illegal for vets to treat pit bulls, and some of them mistakenly believe that's true across the whole state.

You're in politics, so presumably you're well aware that for every individual who takes the initiative to reach out and voice an issue, there are hundreds or thousands of others who share their same concern/sentiment but aren't communicating about it.

That's thousands upon thousands of dogs who aren't getting rabies-and-other-vaccinations. That's thousands upon thousands of dogs whose owners believe they're not permitted to form a relationship with a veterinarian, and thus are deprived of the opportunity to experience sound client education about proper care and training, and are deprived of referrals to behavioral resources, and are deprived of cautions about best practices. And that's thousands upon thousands of dogs that *aren't getting spayed and neutered*, and are having puppies that then end up in the same disadvantaged communities, where people have incorrect information and don't take appropriate care of them as a result.

You can see that BSL doesn't actually cause compliance by just stepping outside and visiting any dog park. The pits/mixes you see by and large belong to those owners who have the social, economic, and educational privilege to get their dogs basic medical and behavioral care, and they typically have the literacy in dog management to raise good dogs. Many pits that you never see are also well-raised, but many of those that are not well-raised *would* be if their owners knew they had the option of getting appropriate medical and behavioral services.

**There are, and will always be, many thousands of pit bulls in Denver. If the goal is for them to be managed well, with appropriate healthcare and behavioral care for their own safety and that of the population, then legalizing them and enhancing regulations on dog care (and on dangerous dogs, of any breed) is the ONLY reasonable course of action.**

**BSL Perpetuates Racial (and Economic) Class Tensions**

Since it lays the foundation for this point better than I can, here's an excerpt from the essay ""Racism and the American Pit Bull"" \[  [https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/08/racism-and-the-american-pit-bull](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/08/racism-and-the-american-pit-bull) \]   


""In the 20th century, the 1970s witnessed the swift and precipitous decline of modern cities. As America’s urban areas struggled, poorer residents, often Latino and Black, came to depend on pit bulls, which were an affordable means of receiving protection and companionship.  


The media vilification of pit bulls soon followed. Dickey suggests that the creation of the 24-hours news cycle, inaugurated by CNN in 1980, represented a turning point. The rise of cable television created a salacious interest in 'ghetto' and 'thug' stories, and the news networks loved to report on the viciousness of urban 'animals' both canine and human. A July 1987 Sports Illustrated story about pit bulls featured a cover illustration of the dog snarling, open-mouthed, with fangs on full display. The title in large print and all caps: 'BEWARE OF THIS DOG.' During this time, at the height of the Drug War, the media similarly stigmatized Latino and Black men. They were treated as toxic carriers of drug addiction and social dysfunction, much as rats and other animals have been cast as sources of disease.  


The link made between savage beasts or dangerous animals and black humans is as old as the history of enslavement.""

In the Denver metro area, these stigmas are alive and well today. When people make claims like ""People who like pit bulls only do so because they're violent people themselves"", or ""these dogs exist to be used in dogfighting and other crime"" -- both of which have been paraphrased frequently throughout the comment threads on news pieces about this very bill -- that's a demonstration of not just ignorance, but ignorance influenced by latent/cultural racism and/or classism. There is an association of certain breeds with certain *perceived* Types of People (whatever that looks like to the speaker -- it can vary, but usually involves a combination of any number of stereotypes about oppressed groups).

These types of held prejudices, against these *perceived*, imagined, oversimplified, one-dimensionalized Types of People, frequently manifest in the form of attacking things (or *perceived* things) about their correlated lifestyles. History has seen it in motives for marijuana criminalization, we have seen it in Islamophobia-rooted tensions about refugees, and we're seeing it now in people's motives for illegalizing the types of dogs that certain *perceived* Types of People love. Obviously racism isn't always part of the picture, but prejudice takes many forms, and it's all motivated from the same place of distancing oneself from sharing the label ""human"" with people one doesn't like.

BSL is one of many ripple effects of this; there's a powerful argument to be made about how increase in Latino populations in the 1970s and 1980s directly preceded bans of pit bulls in a number of cities, Denver included. BSL is also a force that also helps to perpetuate the phenomenon, by keeping systemic negative feedback loops in place, and feeding stigmas that prevent people from recognizing that those systemic problems exist to begin with.

The laws by which our society works lay the basis for critical thinking and values-development, for generations that see the changes made and even more for generations that grow up under the new ways. We're getting places with having society get over how other lifestyle choices don't actually *cause* the things that negatively correlate with them. **If the goal is for society to progress into a place where we're self-aware enough to handle disagreements with each other -- at scale -- by addressing one another as real humans instead of addressing caricatures of each other, then we must start from a logical foundation of looking at stigmas about lifestyle choices objectively. This requires asking ourselves whether things simply** ***appear*** **to be hazardous or** ***correlate*** **with hazardousness, instead of actually being inherently hazardous.** **The right course of action, not just scientifically but also ethically, is to treat dogs as the individuals they are, and invest instead in regulating specific, pragmatic, enforceable options to ensure that** ***all*** **dogs are just more broadly saved from becoming dangerous in the first place (and handled appropriately in the edge cases where mistakes are made).**

**BSL Perpetuates Homelessness**

Recovery from homelessness is like attempting to climb a ladder without rungs, with all the rungs stacked on the roof above you, tauntingly within sight, but painfully impossible to reach.

Implicit criminalization of homelessness is like being on a surface of jagged rocks that are iced over, and knowing that if you jump or wiggle just a tiny bit wrongly, without constantly paying attention to everything from your shoelaces to the way the wind is blowing, that each attempt you make to move upward -- or even just keeping your side rails in position (i.e. surviving and nothing else) -- can result in you taking a nasty fall and then having to start from a lower position again, and perhaps injured for it.

My homelessness isn't nearly as implicitly criminalized as that of many others ('cause privilege etc.), but I know a *lot* of people, and a *lot* of them are on the street, and a *lot* of people on the street are regularly screwed by all kinds of implicit criminalization of homelessness. I know that that's not news to you guys, though -- you've seemed like a Council that's overall pretty hip about those hitches in the system, and I love it.

I think, though, that it could be made clearer just how much certain things matter when you're in that kind of struggling position, and how criminalization of those things is one of the most insidious ways that the jagged rocks get more iced over.

I just had a discussion yesterday with someone who didn't understand that a sense of adventure and resilience and willingness-to-go-new-places is a privilege that not everyone can practice, a strength not everyone is physically healthy enough to develop. The same is true for things like emotional support from personal relationships. A lot of what I describe as the ""entrenched homeless"" (those who aren't recalcitrant, just stuck) are at their depth-in-the-quicksand partly because of the huge role that emotional support plays, and when your peers in the entrenched homeless community are the strongest or maybe even sole source of support in your life, it becomes very natural to hang onto that day in and day out, even if you have a dream of eventually leaving it all behind.

Taking this into account, now consider the depth of the relationships that people have with their dogs *even* when they're lucky enough to have all kinds of good relationships in their lives and few mental and physiologic stressors.

Now, don't add those two needs/fulfillments together, but rather, multiply them, and square the whole thing again for every bit of trauma someone has gone or goes through.

I know I'm *far* from the only person in the homeless community who decided a long time ago that my dogs come before everything else, and that as long as I can take good enough care of us to know that I'm taking good care of them, I don't give a damn how long I'm inconvenienced by them being extra weight and yanking on my arms while I'm building rungs for the ladder. Family matters more and more, the less of it you have. Our dogs -- and for hundreds of people, their pit bulls -- are reliable, trusting, lovable, loyal, durable, hardworking friends who always do their best to cheer us up and keep us safe. For many of us, they are, or have at points been, the only friends like that we've had.

Pit bulls are disproportionately represented in disadvantaged populations, where there's a need for loyalty and caretaker-ness and ability-to-look-intimidating, but also a need for steadfast and honest *love*, because those things are exactly what they're good at. And this keeps a substantial subgroup of people in the homeless population even more entrenched than they otherwise would be, because they have to be less visible, farther from resources (since practically all the resources are in Denver), and filtered through yet another layer of stigma to the casual onlooker (which doesn't just suck for things like getting jobs or begging for money; it also makes you feel like garbage, and that beats you down over time, too).

Services for the unhoused, as a whole, need to evolve in a more dog-friendly direction -- but of course that's not simple, and takes time, and some things are already shifting there and I'm working on some stuff about it. But one thing that you guys have the power to do *right now* is lift a critical barrier, one that prevents a lot of people from accessing services, and end yet another way in which our homeless population is disproportionately vulnerable to an implicit criminalization.

**If the goal is for people to be able to trust our city and feel safe and loved here, and trust that there is a** ***real way*** **to become a secure part of things again -- a trust which must be built before people feel empowered to engage with resources -- then they need to know their loved ones are safe and loved in the city too, because that's what's kept them feeling safe and loved so far.**

  
\--

I hope those expansions on the subject help you to see pit bulls, and breed-specific legislation as a whole, in a new light.

BSL doesn't just cause certain specific narrow problems -- it perpetuates really far-reaching insidious complex problems. 

Lifting BSL doesn't just make things a little bit better for a few -- it makes a *lot* of really important, deep-running things *way* better for *everyone*.

Please vote to overrule the veto and lift the pit bull ban. It's the right thing scientifically, morally, and *pragmatically*. It's a step in a healthier direction for everyone. Please help our society to become more integrated and more understanding of each other. This is a critical part of that process. And I know you're in your field because you genuinely want things to get better. There's no other explanation for putting up with the crap you have to endure. :P

So please -- make things better with this elegant change in how the puzzle pieces are all aligned. The seemingly counterintuitive moves are, very often, exactly the right ones.

2186,2186,ElLechero,1581996116,f5l664,Nan,"This should come as no surprise to you, but discussions, especially political discussions, get pretty heated on /r/Denver. As the people reviewing the mod queue we see the worst that all of you have personally experienced on /r/Denver combined, and frankly, we're sick of seeing how badly some people choose to treat their fellow Denverites.

In the past we've taken a lighter stance on this, expecting everyone to have thick skin. In talking with a lot of people IRL and online that participate in the subreddit currently, or have in the past, we have a good understanding on what content they do and do not want to see on /r/denver. Many people just want to read about happenings in Denver, read about laws being proposed and discussed and enforced, talk about fun things to do around the city, or share pictures of pretty sunsets. Those people are often hesitant to participate because of how many people treat others here, and how we've been condoning it by allowing it. Some have left the community entirely because of it.

Starting today we're going to be more strictly enforcing Rule #2, and we're going to bolster Rule #4 to dissuade political shilling.

**What's a political shill?**

If you rapidfire post the same link to 14 different Colorado or political subreddits, you're probably a political shill. If the vast majority of your engagement on /r/Denver is to express support or condemnation for a specific candidate or policy or law, you're probably a political shill. I'm open to hearing arguments as to why that might be a good thing to allow on the subreddit, but having moderated /r/Denver through a couple contentious election cycles now, it will take a lot of convincing to change my mind.

Our goal is not to eliminate political discussion, especially good faith political discussion from /r/denver. However, the political shilling/trolling is by nature not good faith discussion. It only creates derision, and makes others not want to discuss these issues at all. More often than not, the accounts engaging in this behavior make people resent those associated with the cause they claim to support because of the hostility/toxicity. No one will be banned outright solely for participating in quarantined subreddits, but participation and commentary elsewhere on reddit will be taken into account if you're a user that generates a lot of reports.

Refrain from making blanket judgements about individuals and entire groups of people. If you're calling Bernie supporters communists, if you're calling Trump supporters nazis, if the only sentiment you can express on police enforcement is ACAB, then you're probably not going to be participating on /r/Denver for much longer. If your only input to a general political thread is going to be ""Republicans are all awful"", don't bother, we're going to remove your comment. If there's a post about a Democratic candidate and your only input on the thread is ""MAGA 2020"", don't bother, we're going to remove your comment. If you disagree with someone and decide to personally attack them, or a group of people you perceive them to belong to, your comment will be removed and you may be banned. In addition, new accounts will be held to greater scrutiny than established accounts with an otherwise good history of commenting and posting.

The modteam has previously discussed karma limits/negative karma limits for participation on /r/denver, and those years ago we decided that we didn't want to silence unpopular opinions solely because they are unpopular. In the time since we've decided that, never has someone participating on /r/Denver with Reddit's maximum negative karma level (-100) been someone that wasn't spewing hateful vitriol and starting fights. Allowing such accounts to continue to post has subjected /r/Denver to their toxicity for the sake of an ideal that serves no good purpose. At the very least we'll be filtering comments and posts from such users, and we may decide to disallow their participation entirely in the future.

As moderators we are ultimately responsible for the content that appears on /r/Denver. We're tired of seeing people that live, work and play in the same city/region treat one another so poorly. There's a fine line to walk with enforcement and we're not going to please everyone. We can always reevaluate these changes in the future, but we think that once you see the changes in practice you'll agree that they'll make /r/Denver a better place.


**TL;DR: Be nice to each other, argue in good faith, and if you want to shill buy an ad. You might just see a username or a comment you disagree with, but there's a human being on the other side of it.**

In my current city, my commute is approx. 15 min walking + 20 minute public transport (would buy car in Denver). Ideally, I wouldn't be doing much more than that time wise. My schedule is semi-flexible, so I wouldn't have to be on a strict 9-5. In all likelihood would be leaving my apartment between 9:15-9:30.

Based on searching online, it seems Washington Park is another recommended neighborhood, but after browsing rental sites there aren't as many rental opportunities as in Capitol Hill. Not really sure where else, given I'm mid-20s and into the more concert/museum scene. My budget would be &lt;=$2000/mo for one bedroom.",Denver,Commuting/Neighborhoods

Haven’t seen the dentist in years?
Have you ever been told you need a “deep cleaning?” Or S/RP?
Do your gums bleed when you brush?
Do you use a manual toothbrush? Don’t floss?
Do you smoke tobacco products? 

My school takes Medicaid, but no other insurance. You do NOT need insurance to be seen- many people pay out of pocket! While the appointments are longer, the cost is a fraction of the price in a general office without insurance. A full deep cleaning, or SRP, and full set of x-rays costs no more $90. 🤗

Met with a therapist, and got an adderall prescription . The change was dramatic. My focus is much better. My anxiety is much better. My depression is much better. I used to be unable to get through the day without crashing HARD around early afternoon. My head would feel thick and heavy and I pretty much would have to take a nap for at least 30-45 minutes or slog through the rest of day half zombified. All of that is gone, and I don't miss it because I didn't like it. In short. I'm happier and much closer to the person I want to be now than I was before. Fast forward to the start of 2019 and we switched to Kaiser. I called to arrange for a prescription through them, and was informed I needed to take a urine test first. That was a surprise. I'm a cannabis user. Recreationally. An end of the day thing. After my obligations have been met. Alcohol, even a little, impacts me negatively for days. Cannabis does not. I let them know that I would be testing positive for Cannabis, they let me know that was a problem and gave me a bridge script and a month to submit the test. So I quit using cannabis, and took the test after a month or so. I assume it was clean because I started getting my monthly prescription filled. I actually stayed clean for the better part of the year. But eventually got annoyed that my choices were being dictated by an insurance company and started using cannabis again. I've now been informed I need to take another urine test (yes I knew that was a possibility). I'm assuming that if I tried to 'beat' it, I would also show clean for adderall, so I don't think that will work. Just looking for other Denverite's experience with Kaiser in this area. I'm bummed, because this prescription has been so helpful for me. I take it as prescribed, I don't 'party' with it or share it, and I don't use Cannabis during work hours (and work is my main concern, the reason I initially brought it up with my GP, and where I've found my script to be most beneficial) Just wondering if others have had this experience with Kaiser. What I should expect, what I should do going forward, etc. Because I will not be 'passing' this test if they screen for THC.",Denver,Kaiser urine test for prescriptions

In addition to the increase in ridership, I'm interested in how a fare-free transit system would further encourage transit-oriented development and make the future of our city substantially less car-dependent.

It is shameful that when I get off the bus at 5:40am I see security guards hitting their batons on the metal benches homeless people sleep on in the tunnel/bus terminal to wake them up and move them along.  I heard one say ""where we all going today, Ft. Collins?"" Well fuck you security asshole. Fuck you for trying to send homeless people to a place with worse/less resources just to get them out of *your* face.  Fuck the security guards in the evening that arrest anyone homeless when they are trying to board a bus to the suburbs or Boulder, I've seen that too.

I'm trying tot ravel to all sorts of places, but on a budget and as I am sure all of you know, Denver is a popular spot to go to from Los Angeles because the trips are really cheap. I managed to score a round trip flight leaving Saturday AM and coming back Sunday AM. I am not getting an AirBnB or a Hotel. I intend to be outside and walk for roughly the 20-22 hours I'll be there. I do trips like this every weekend, where I go to a random place and walk around and do stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone here create for me a step by step guide on stuff you think I should do, taking into account that I will have no access to a car and refuse to use Taxi's or Rideshares? I don't mind walking/taking the bus, I can walk  about 20 miles before I get tired. Thanks guys!

2652,2652,sanfrantokyotron,1582934451,fb405l,Nan,"In celebration of Denver Airport’s 25th birthday, 9News published 113 facts about the airport that will make you sound more knowledgeable next time you’re traveling through the airport with friends or family.  The complete list can be found at https://www.9news.com/mobile/article/travel/denver-international-airport/fun-facts-about-dia/73-26ec9915-65dd-4764-88bf-08a931add503.

Some of my favorites include:

5.  Most noise complaints against the airport come from a small group. In 2019, more than half of the noise complaints came from three people.

14. Medics believe only one baby has been born inside of the airport in the 25 years it's been open.

16. DIA goes through 400 cases of toilet paper per week, and there are 96 rolls a case. That’s 38,400 rolls of toilet paper per week. This number has held steady since 2018, though the airport said it will increase its order to 500 cases during holidays and busy summer weeks.

31.  Utah ski resorts thought DIA would be a failure based on the highly-publicized issues with the baggage system and sent out advertisements that said: ""In Denver, you could lose your luggage. In Utah, you could lose yourself.""

35.  9NEWS anchor Gary Shapiro had the first beer served at DIA: “The night Stapleton closed, I did the 10 p.m. news at DIA as a reporter…I was doing a 10 p.m. live shot from the Red Rocks Grill, and said, “Can I have a beer to do a toast at the end of my live shot?” They said, “We can’t serve you because our liquor license doesn’t kick in until midnight.” I said, ”OK, that means you can’t sell me a beer, but you can give me one, right?” They said, “I guess we can do that.” So the owner of the bar and I toasted the closing of old Stapleton and the opening of DIA on the air, and I drank the beer after the live shot… I did the morning show the next day as an anchor. In between, I ran home and changed clothes, drove back in the snow, and caught a cat nap in the media center they had built on the fifth level.”

45.  The DIA bathrooms have a fan club. People on Twitter and Reddit have posted about loving their smell, and an airport spokesman previously told us they get compliments about it. The bathroom scent is called “Black Bamboo.” Aire-Master Front Range, a company based out of Colorado Springs, is responsible for changing the air fresheners every month.

49.  There are cameras that take pictures of license plates as cars drive into airport parking facilities. The airport will help people find their cars if they forget where they parked.

50.  About 48,000 items end up in the airport lost-and-found every year. Found items have included teddy bears, a big screen TV, a chainsaw and a 6-foot-tall stuffed banana. The most commonly lost items to end up there are IDs and sunglasses.

53.  A plaque at DIA says it was built by the New World Airport Commission. According to Westword, this name — which has prompted many a conspiracy theory — actually came from one organizer’s love of Dvorak’s “New World Symphony.”

103.  DIA paid Panasonic $11.5 million to build a welcome sign along Peña Boulevard, and another $3 million for 12 years of maintenance. The goal was to be able to pay for the sign in 10 years from advertising revenue, but the airport ran into some hiccups when it was barred from taking money from businesses off-premises. In 2018, the Federal Highway Administration approved DIA's request to remove that stretch of Peña from the National Highway System, therefore allowing the ads to run as normal.

106.  As of this writing, DIA has 3.5 stars on Yelp (that's out of five) and 3,201 reviews.",Denver,Denver Airport’s 25th Birthday: 113 facts didn't really have to know about Denver International Airport

2654,2654,klyphw,1582938691,fb4wkg,Nan,"For those that were unaware (like myself), Globeville Landing Park is now open. The city in their infinite wisdom decided to have the opening take place on Dec 19th in the dead of winter and in the midst of Christmas to ensure that no one heard about it. 

Anyway, I went today for the first time with my 2 and 4 year olds and the city did a tremendous job with the remodel. The playground is huge, lots of green space, and a really cool amphitheatre seating area in front of the Platte. Other than a guy playing fetch with his dog I didn’t see another person for the hour and a half we were there.

Me and my fiance will be visiting Denver in mid-late March and are looking for any suggestions people may have for things to do in/around the Denver area. We will be in the main city for a few days and would be open to any great restaurant recommendations - we love American, Mexican and Asian cuisine.

We both love nature and also want to spend a few days visiting the beautiful landscapes around the city. My current list included: Great Sand Dunes, White River National Forest, Rocky Mountains Park (and Estes nearby) and Garden of the Gods. Are any of these suitable at this time of year? My understanding at this time of year is that the weather can change drastically, and many of the high altitude roads (eg mt evans scenic byway) will be closed. Does anyone have any recommendations for places to see the amazing mountain scenery?

Finally, is Aurora a nice place to stay? It seems like a good are for some decent and affordable accomodation and cenral enough to allow easy access to the city.

Please note this event is not officially affiliated with APS at all. We're just some stuck physicists looking to make the best of the situation.

We will be meeting at room 262P of the Plaza Building South Annex on Auraria campus from 11:00AM on Tuesday 2nd March.

In the wallet there was a $5 bill, a Buffalo Exchange gift card, 2 RTD bus passes - one for Feb and one for March. There was also a red debit card from Bank of America, a few business cards, and a vertical Texas ID.

A little bit about me: I am currently am a junior in high school in the Denver area. I am a biracial Asian/caucasian and identify as a gay male. Because I've gone to a very small rigorous private school my whole entire life, I would love to go to a large school with a great diversity of people. I have a high ACT score of 30+ and a GPA of 3.87.

I'm looking for colleges in-state due to cost and affordability. I am interested in majoring in music business. I would like to enter the music industry as a singer/songwriter. However, I would like to get more information about the music programs offered at CU Boulder and CU Denver. For now, I am looking at two possible routes and I do not know which route I should take. The two routes are CU Denver and CU Boulder.

***CU DENVER PROS/CONS:***

I understand that CU Denver has an excellent music business program. It is one of the top music business schools in the nation as said by Billboard in 2017. I've seen their alumni become great artists, for instance, The Fray. Some of their newest alumni also have gained some traction with their newest songs on Spotify, receiving about half a million playbacks. **HOWEVER,** I also understand that CU Denver has not a great community. It is a commuter school and I am afraid of the social life I will have there compared to CU Boulder. To be honest, I am scared of being unhappy there with no friends. I also would maybe have to still live at home where I can never be myself– as I am still in the closet and not out to my parents.

***CU BOULDER PRO/CONS***

I absolutely LOVE the CU Boulder campus and the town of Boulder. I love the social life at CU Boulder and all the people I have talked to have loved their experience there. It is just enough far away from home and I love the people there too. In addition, their music program is very strong. **HOWEVER,** I realize that Boulder's program is follows a classical orientation.  I will not be able to learn specifically about the music industry and I will most likely have a difficult time networking in the music industry. My current voice teacher feels that I should follow the classical route while learning about the music business in other venues such as internships while in school– but i honestly do not know.

If anyone could help me with this dilemma, that would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for reading.",Denver,CU Denver Vs. CU Boulder: Prospective Student Dilemma

My boyfriend and I have found the perfect apartment in Denver but i'm very nervous because our dog, Ted, is a mixed breed.

I'm wondering if apartments do a full DNA breed profile when they test for poop and if he's not a majority mix of the restricted breeds will he be ok?

It's probably too late for some areas such as masks - yes they are helpful even if you use them wrong.

But,  if you decide that you are a little nervous (panic has a purpose), and  you start thinking about planning, I would recommend the following:

Water  and electricity will be fine.  If they fail, it's over and we'll just  have to see who survives.  So don't buy all the bottled water - it makes  no sense.  If you're really worried, buy a BOB water container for your  bathtub online.  But really, you should buy ingredients.

Oils,  spices, meats, pastas (this one is obvious), nuts, granola, butters,  ultra pasteurized milk (lasts much longer), beer?, and flours.

Buy  long lasting fruit like apples which will last for months if stored  between 45-55 degrees.  Buy frozen foods like vegetables, fruit,  chicken, and beef.

Give up on organic for a while because it won't last as long.

Learn  about storing things to last long.  If you beat eggs, you can freeze  them in ice cube trays.  For that matter, eggs will last 2-3 weeks past  the date on the carton if refrigerated.  Learn about blanching to freeze  vegetables like Cauliflower or broccoli.  For all of existence, it was  normal for people to store extra food in their homes.  It's only been in  the recent decades that people have lost this goal.

Don't  buy stuff that you don't already eat because either 1 - this blows over  and it'll all be wasted, or 2 - you won't want to eat it and you'll  take unneeded risks.

Buy medicines  assuming hospitals won't take you unless you're basically dying.  I  believe the current regime for mild cases is tylenol and advil when a  fever spikes over 100, and guaifenesin regularly to keep small airways  clear - but these are just words because I'm not a doctor - decide  yourself.

The point of this isn't  to provide you with a complete list - it's to make you think.  What if  tomorrow, life becomes different than today?  What if your worries of  yesterday become meaningless as a global crisis continues.  Even if this  doesn't continue (it will), the economy will already feel an immense  impact from the lack of goods from China.  This is why people are buying  toilet paper - not because they are crazy, but because almost all  toilet paper is made in China.  Even Costco said they only had enough  inventory for 60-90 days and this was before the stockpiling began.

Italy  had 326 cases on Feb 26th, so you do the math.  This thing is coming  and no where near enough is being done to stop it.  It will overrun  hospitals and continue to cause panic.  Hopefully, it turns out that  it's not as fatal, but it's been two months and this hasn't yet been  determined.  If anything the fatality rating has grown.

Call  me crazy at your own peril.  The worst case for planning a little is  that you might have to buy a fewer groceries in a month.  The worse case  for being ignorant is sickness without access to a doctor.

Just some quick thoughts.

As I was walking on Gaylord towards my car I could hear a man screaming from somewhere, thought it was coming from the apartment building at the corner of 14th and Gaylord because I could see windows open. Then suddenly out of nowhere there's a guy behind me charging straight for me on his bike yelling and I can hear that he called me a bitch. I thought he was yelling at me to get off the sidewalk and out of his way so I started walking on the grass but as he got closer I hear, ""STOP RIGHT THERE YOU FUCKING BITCH!"" and catches up to me, stops his bike, and starts yelling, ""WHAT THE FUCK IS IN YOUR HANDS BITCH?! SHOW ME WHAT'S IN YOUR FUCKING HANDS! RIGHT NOW! YOU FUCKING BITCH!"" I started to run and he followed me continuing to yell calling me a bitch so I ran into the street to get away and started yelling back that I didn't have anything, I didn't know him, leave me alone, get the fuck away from me, etc trying to make a bigger scene than he was but I was starting to have a panic attack. All I had was my phone and keys and my backpack because I was leaving for work. I raised my hands to show that all I had were car keys and a cell phone.

We're both UK law students completing our final year online. We have interned in an American immigration law firm, and he put us in touch with a few firms in Denver, so we're hoping to work with our current experience. 

We'd appreciate advice on a few things: 

- any colorado specific job application / interview etiquette 

- potential part time work to sustain us while we get set up (we're too young to be picky/snobby)


- neighborhood knowledge/niches we wouldn't find online. In regards to that, we are athletic, want to reach the mountains, esp slopes, while still getting a downtown feel (in a perfect world) 

- we're buying a car, and it seems like SUVs are the norm. However is a 4wd sedan sometimes reaching the mountain doable? 

- concerning setup costs, are the any ways to save money setting up utilities, furniture, desk etc. Even promo codes are welcome. 

- all tips appreciated.

He starts off by saying that he is just some dumb guy from CSU so who is he to question the experts? Well... exactly. You aren't an expert. Normally I don't agree with the stay in your lane argument because everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in the case of a public health emergency, if you don't know what you are talking about then you should just shut the hell up. Giving out misleading or wrong information can get people killed.

Then he starts his rant on the main points that the experts made. The first being that the US health care system was not well prepared for this. However he knows people in the county health department and they have been working for months on this so they are prepared. Does he also know that it took over a month longer for the CDC to developed a test for coronavirus than most of the world? That one of the reasons that the number of reported cases is so low in the US is because they couldn't test for it? Just because they knew about it and were making plans does not mean that the US was as prepared as they should have been.

The second point the experts made was that it is no longer possible to prevent the virus from coming here and that trying to contain should be the priority. He actually agreed with the fact that it was already here, but then went on about how we don't need to close down schools or anything yet. That is the same policy that has been taken in countries like Italy. The problem is that people become sick and contagious before they really start showing symptoms or getting checked. That is why it is spreading so fast. Waiting until 1 person is diagnosed before reacting means that now a group of people are infected with it instead of just 1 person.

There were other things he went on about, but at this point I couldn't believe someone could be this ignorant and speak with such authority to such a large audience. His cohost was just agreeing with every thing he said and adding to his authority. She didn't offer a single counter point or try and add any balance to it. She was just a yes man. If you aren't an expert in communicable diseases then just shut up and let the experts talk. Spreading misinformation is bad enough, but contradicting experts and making fun of them because they are speaking at a prestigious university is just dangerous. This is why anti-vaxxers exist.

Our budget is roughly 2k a month and we would need a 2 bedroom place. If it’s possible having a house would be amazing where we could possibly be a little louder when it comes to music/friends over.

My girlfriend and some other bystanders performed CPR and called 911. The ambulance arrived in 14 minutes. We did all we could, and I hope they were able to revive him the ambulance. I wish we could find out if he pulled through. Don’t know his name or where they took him. It was the first time any of us had to use the CPR training and I think we did a good job as a group. But now I can’t stop being critical of my actions and thinking of him and wondering if we could have done better in some way.

Stay up on CPR training, y’all. If you see someone who’s collapsed and not breathing and detect no pulse, start CPR immediately. Don’t stand around waiting for EMS. Don’t be afraid to take charge and ask others for help to get important tasks completed. Chest compressions only is the new technique. I’m going to take CPR training much more seriously for the rest of my life. 

And make sure you have emergency contacts set in your phone.",Denver,To the family of the runner who collapsed at a Sloan’s Lake yesterday...

I finally felt good enough to be able to lift the bike into my car yesterday, but when I got there, my bike was gone.  

I saw some stuff online how if a bicycle gets left at an RTD station for longer than 24 hours, it can be impounded. Obviously this might be grasping at straws hoping that it wasn't stolen. But the Denver police bike impound (which I'm pretty sure is just a private auction house) won't pick up the phone or respond to voicemail. And when I call various police lines, I get redirected to lost and found, RTD police, regular Denver police, the bike impound again, a random detective one time, etc. No one really seems to know how to get ahold of the right person to know. 

Does anyone have any experience with bike impound or leaving a bike at an RTD station like I did? I know I'm pretty stupid for not having a good lock and leaving my bike in a not-so-great area, but I'm just hoping for a chance that it was impounded and not stolen.

I urge you to call Denver Public Schools and Community College of Denver and ask them to shut school down and move it online before the virus outbreak gets worse (as it inevitably will). Even though most students are not part of the population that is most vulnerable to the virus, crowded schools and classrooms are the perfect places for students to pick up the virus and become carriers. This could bring the virus to the elderly and otherwise immunocompromised. I am especially concerned about Denver Public Schools because 3 schools have already been closed for cleaning due to coronavirus exposure, and young children may not understand how to protect others when they are sick. I am also concerned about Community College of Denver because it has yet to choose whether to remain open or closed while CU Denver and MSU (which share the same campus) have made the decision to close after their spring breaks. As a student, I am concerned that I could become a carrier and infect family members or customers at my job.

It seems important to start local if we all want to find the best ways we can help each other, and reddit could be a powerful tool for organizing ourselves. At the same time, it's important that we don't try to help and instead continue to spread the virus. Of the top of my head, I'm wondering if there are effective ways to do the following without further spreading the disease. Maybe in a Startup Weekend style of intense discussion and testing:

-Crowd Source safe child care for health care workers and other critical roles (would need to make sure everyone is somehow vetted through another organization and is healthy)

-Safely get food and support to seniors, especially those who are not already in care facilities (GoFundMe that feeds into an amazon food shipping account?)

-Create a hub to voluntarily distribute reasonable amounts of supplies to those in need locally (ideally this won't be necessary soon as shelves recover from the initial hoarding surge)

-Organize local online gaming events to kill boredom

-More structurally support small businesses if things get really dire (organized gift card purchases all at once for specific business, for example, if they are on the ropes. Perhaps a hub where they can reach out?)

Just some thoughts, and maybe this is a better conversation for down the road. If it does get to that point, though, I'm hoping this can be a good spot to discuss these types of measures.",Denver,How can we all safely help?

I wrote a  letter this morning based on an email I got from my kids teachers. They specifically were told not to assign homework  I understand letting people have spring break. . .but the CCSD seems unprepared


Douglass county last week was asking students and confirming chromebooks/computers.

CCSD teachers were clueless and planing parties that would never happen.

This is wrong.  A pandemic isn't a surprise. We knew that this could happen anytime.  The fact that in 2020 we are not prepared

I just think if you have kids. . .you should be encouraging our governments to do more


//What I wrote to my state representatives, CCSD district, and Governer 

It is understandable (though not in line with CDC recommendations) that school is out.    This closure is indefinite. This virus shows no signs of slowing down in Australia (summer) or Flordia.  There is no way we will know if the schools will reopen.


I have neighbors in Douglass county who checked with students about online capabilities.  Those students will be given lesson plans (virtual).

Cherry creek school district specifically said our teachers CAN not give lessons.

This is unacceptable.   I am lucky enough that I can accommodate my children and feed them.  Yet I am frustrated about how ill-prepared the school district is for this eventually (especially since as long as I remember a Pandemic was only a matter of not IF but when).   

As a voter, I think we all have hard questions on how lack of prepared these schools are showing (at least cherry creek) and how there is no plan at all in the year 2020 to help our students continue to learn.

I will make my own lesson plan. it will not be in line with the teacher. We have no guidance.  We don't know what to do next, what is appropriate

Until a few days ago I was not taking the Coronavirus situation too seriously.  However the fact of the matter is:  it is a highly contagious and deadly disease.  It doesn’t matter if people are still dying from the regular flu or tuberculosis or heart disease or cancer.  WE NEED TO BE QUARANTINING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING OURSELVES to prevent the spread of this illness.  Even if you or your loved ones aren’t “at risk” you can still infect others who will then infect others.  This thing will spiral out of control at an exponential rate.  People are going to continue to panic and hoard groceries.  Hospital beds will start filling up until we don’t have anymore and the healthcare system will be overloaded.  If we don’t nip this in the bud RIGHT NOW the economic implications are huge.  Yea it’s a huge job loss to close down businesses for a week or two but think about how worse it’s going to be a couple months down the line if we’ve failed to contain it and 100’s or 1000’s more are dead and now we have to shut down the entire county for the summer? Summer tourism and music industries are huge for many states.  So PLEASE do your part and stay home.  

I understand that many cases are mild.  I understand many people don’t even show symptoms but this is still a very serious issue right now and we have the power to limit its spread.

If you have not already taken an avalanche safety class, if you don't have knowledge of the snowpack and prevailing conditions, if you don't have every necessary piece of gear, and friends who also have all of the aforementioned prereqs, stay out of the backcountry.

You will put yourself at risk, you will jeopardize the safety of other riders and skiers and, god forbid something happen, you're then risking the safety of brave men and women who have to come save (likely just recover) your body.

A message from Xcel Energy CEO Ben Fowke

Delivering for our customers around the clock, every day, is at the core  of what we do. That means providing the reliable service you count on,  in good times, and even more importantly, in challenging times. In  keeping this commitment, your safety and the safety of our employees  will always be our top priority.

Delivering for our customers around the clock, every day, is at the core  of what we do. That means providing the reliable service you count on,  in good times, and even more importantly, in challenging times. In  keeping this commitment, your safety and the safety of our employees  will always be our top priority.

As COVID-19 affects a growing number of people in our communities, we  are prepared and are taking steps to ensure we’ll continue to be there  for you to meet your energy needs. We have a strong track record of  preparing for emergencies because we know you rely on us to power your  homes and businesses, and to help fuel the economies of the eight states  we serve. Here are just a few of the steps we are taking:

We are in constant communication with local, state and federal agencies and health organizations to coordinate responses.

We have staffing plans in place to ensure power plant operators,  line workers, customer care representatives and others continue  delivering the reliable service you expect.

We will not disconnect service to any residential customers until  further notice. If you are having difficulty paying your bills, contact  us and we will arrange a payment plan that works for you.

To reduce the potential spread of illness, we have travel  restrictions in place for employees, are asking many employees to work  from home, and have enhanced the cleaning at our facilities.

The energy grid is a key part of our nation’s critical infrastructure,  and we take our responsibility to our customers and our employees very  seriously. You can expect that crews will continue with our  industry-leading power outage restoration when severe weather strikes.  Our customer care representatives will be ready to help if you have  questions or requests for service. We also have easy-to-use tools so you  have quick access to many of our services. Our automated phone system,  mobile app and website make it easy to report power outages or take care  of other business.

As always, our team will be working day and night to deliver the energy  you and your neighbors count on. As we take these prudent precautions  and put our preparedness plans into action, we are strongly focused on  the health and safety of our team members and everyone in the  communities we are honored to serve.

As moderators during this crisis, our paramount goal is provide the less important topical posts and discusiions. In order to achieve this goal, we will encourage the majority of posts regarding covid-19 to be posted in /r/CoronavirusColorado, and important announcements to be posted here. Further I would like to encourage everyone to subscribe to both subs and recommend using the a [multireddit to view both](https://old.reddit.com/user/ElLechero/m/corona_colorado/), if you wish.

**Here's a brief summary of what to post where:**

1. General Discussion about Covid-19

**Post in this thread.**

2. Important announcements specifically related to Denver by the The Mayor, Governor, or a major government agency such as the CDC

**Make a new post on /r/denver.**

3. Where to find toilet paper, or similar frequently asked questions.

If you can't decided where to post, ask yourself the following. ""Is this critically important, well-sourced information that relates to Denver?"" If the answer is yes, please post it here, if not, but it is still of moderate importance, or interest to you personally, post it to /r/CoronavirusColorado, or ask in the comment section below.


**Most Important Advice to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19:**

- Wash your hands frequently, for 20 second (about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" from start to finish) washing all parts including between fingers. Hand sanitizers may be used as a substitute, but hand washing is preferable. Moisturizing soap will help prevent over drying your hands. 

- Avoid gatherings of people, especially large ones and try to maintain a social distance of 6-feet from other people. Avoid shaking hands

- Avoid Touching your face, eyes, and mouth especially with unwashed hands. If you cough, use your elbow rather than your hands.

- Sanitize doorknobs, counters, sink faucets and other frequently touched surfaces. First clean, then you can use disinfectant wipes, [diluted bleach ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html), full strength hydrogen peroxide, or a disinfectant spray to kill any virii that may be on the surface.

- Don't hoard needed items; don't be a stupid selfish asshole.

my husband is an audio engineer and works at many of the venues around town. odds are he's mixed one of your favorite bands. like most of the community, he's been hit especially hard by the large event ban as the venues he's employed with have gone dark.

one of our friends sent this along: 

&gt; The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) announced Monday that it will give assistance for workers and employers during temporary closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

my question is this: he was a W2 employee for multiple venues/companies (like AEG and Livenation), so to make the most of any potential unemployment benefits, he'd need to be able to claim against each of the places he had a W2 with - is that actually possible? i looked at the FAQs on the CDLE website and didn't see anything that remotely answered a question like this. if anyone has any advice or experience it'd be appreciated!

3509,3509,MyLordMyMooch,1584406469,fjw377,Nan,"About a month ago my family and I flew to Florida with our two daughters age 3/7. The plane made one stop each way and got new passengers. My younger daughters already had influz.-a this year (tested positive) but had a cough and runny nose since about a week before, I hear her coughing in her sleep now as I start this. So sad... Daycare, so what can you do?...

But it (Coronavirus) wasn’t a thing here then and when we flew to Florida a few weeks back, she as a Toddler does: tried to lick everything at DIA.... and largely did, when not screaming like someone snapped her femur on the plane. 

(To the woman who I hush-screamed “she has tubes. - it would make a goddamn difference if she popped her ears 30 times - she has tubes in her ears and can’t pop shit.” I’m not sorry. I heard your advice the first 30 times, I just hadn’t realized you actually needed me to say fuck-off because “x,y,yourfuckingbusiness.”

So, she is the youngest - still - and has the nagging cough, but there are no kits here and doctors aptly through our new shitty ins. is a HMO and therefor useless in this situation. Wife works in healthcare with the elderly. No ability to test easily in CO. But symptoms that were pre-outbreak, of a cough.  Can’t seem to get treatment easily. First world country with insurance at the very least and it’s a pandemic. Also:

Have dad who’s a MD, mom is a nurse, sister-in-law who’s a nurse as well. Cousin is an MD. So is her husband. Wife is a PT.... as of a week or so ago, not one seems concerned other than, ohhh this could potentially be worse than the normal flu, one makes policy decisions (staff medical wise) for a fortune 100 company. Opinions vary now, but have trended downward. One says it’s nature skimming some off the top because we’re not doing it ourselves... unsurprisingly many voted R last election, with the exception of my wife and myself I believe.

Still it’s a bummer as  I’m married with kids and the skis season’s coming to a close is a shitty fucking end of everything. so last night I decided to go to ruby hill and road the remaining snow and hit the rails with some people. Def. not as bad as the group playing soccer then sitting Kum-bye-ya circles after the soccer game, or the group of 75+ I was just told was there hours ago after the ‘no-ski’ announcement yesterday afternoon. 

I was worried for a moment when it looked that they’d set up some sort of checkpoint exiting the park, but it was just some local LE checking on the high school Import-Tuner crowd that had filled the closed library and was doing their best to show off their fancy wheels and rims. But with the pull of cheap gas begging them to burn some rubber, I didn’t get why they all stood so close chatting, “gas is cheap guys, and no one is out - go drive yo!”

Never the less, because I’m between jobs, a few weeks ago I bought up half the dollar store’s hand sanitizer, bleach, Clorox wipes, toothpaste and TP; because I’m an ADD procrastinating prepper with a hunch.

hence... my hands staining orange from yellow #5 in the sanitizer and you fighting  for toilet paper in the great 2020 war preamble: ‘Shats are Getting Serious - 2 poopz- N0 pblm’ - all taking place in what amounts to an in the ally behind king soopers like a shitty version of Jingle All The Way... which was oddly where we road our bikes to get a haircut yesterday in the same strip mall yesterday. 

Stopped by GoodBurger on the way home last night before they closed, and got a shake as requested by my wife, or well spoonbender, because they are out of normal custard and had to use Irish cream, or whatever. 

So last night, I was getting a few drinks in and texting with a friend about his now likely bust surf trip to Portugal in May, my unlikeliest of chances on coming along despite the ticket prices being halved, and how things were fairing as a waiter going at the sushi restaurant in the mtns. before all this shit went down. 

His take it or leave it on the surf trip was “[he] had bought travel insurance so could cancel but was planning on going unless his flight officially got cancelled, ‘can’t close swell’ was the sentiment. 

Although toward the end, he kind of realized like in a Bart to Homer moment...... “Dad, it’s gone.” As they watched a bbq’d pig sail the sky after being jettisoned by a sewage pipe, likely owned by the quintessential industrialist Mr. Burns. 

My friend said he couldn’t do a couple months no pay and would likely need to move. I told him, (remembering prev. friends issues in the mtns., lodging, homelessness issues obv. that will crop up, etc.) “Hey, if you’re out and down the divide - don’t go homeless, the basement room is yours - just tell me.” Gotta do what you can. *Seize the bay* and all that shit. 


(sing it to NOFX - jesusland.)
“*I’ll tell you Damn strait! They just want dock-space, it hasn’t been this bad with the clit-2-ball ratio, down here in Denver now for a while. 
They just wanna talk about clock-space. Guess they don’t know about that Talk-Space, 
IDK bro, haven’t been to down to 16th street, after living here now for in awhile.*


I got the girls to bed and eventually. With the littlest around 11pm - she’s a fighter and I have the *Please Go The Fuck To Sleep* book received as a gift from my wife’s friend memorized - sympathies welcome via PM. 

I almost fell asleep in the bean-bag reading If You Give a Moose a Muffin. But found my way triumphantly to the couch. I drank a couple Corona’s - why should that brand suffer, they seem like an until-there’s-a-Dollop about them okay. okay. since I remember Corona really very fondly from HS and the original F&amp;F movie. 

After everyone was in bed I contemplated going to a strip club... but considering the pros/cons/infection rate re: stripper/gen.pop/and the general strip club patreon infection rates and making some quick life/death mental math decided that value of life and experience gained wise, ‘you know what bro - I’d probably be prob. fine, but ultimately less people driving, and given that I’m going to have been drinking and there being less cover-cars driving-about. Better think bro! Time to stay home.”

It certainly made things more difficult for some  driving at 1am when wanting to not attract attention - not to mention my drunk corona-stripper-2-pole-2-patreon ratio math may be incorrect and but I doubt they’re disinfecting shit. But, you never know... Maybe they’d wear a surgical mask... and like do some walking/dead-themed, or like *Contagion Theme Night! / infections pole-2-pole / 2g’s, no view of the holes - still have a cover./ That’s how we roll in the C-O-Strip-Club-Y-O-Y-O-C-O-C-O!*” 

So I made the responsible decision and stayed home at 1am, for the community. I enjoyed the feeling of warmth in my stomach from the good and responsible decision with a chaser of blue-ox whisky. 70% pure grain alcohol! 

I solidified my decided to ‘take one for the team and not go to the strip club.’ I get it, we all gotta sacrifice and put our hands together here.’ I told myself. 

The next morning, today, I ate emergency ramen for breakfast on the toilet with a Naturday and watched John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight Coronavirus pandemic episode update on the iPad. 

Glad schools out as it sounds like shits sufficiently serious. Well not for my kids, thank god, that’s the saving grace, it’s be terrible if they showed their symptoms, nonstop need for tissues. Now it’s just there. No biggie. 

My littlest in the morning first asked to go to the pool, to which I told her the Rec Center was closed, then the library, also closed... she was pissed, but I offered that we could take a bath. She said then bargained Zoo. 

I replied “nah, probably the same.... well, mom wasn’t convinced on what I’d said about big places and gatherings. Also, Reddit has something about a concert at Pepsi center that seems slightly less than optimal at this point. Nothing compared to that Viva La Mexicano Influenza’s-Exodus Flowing fest that happened a few days back I read about on /r/collapse, but uh... yeah never mind let me check my phone.” 

The three year old screamed “Zoooo zooooooo, zooo, zoooooo” in response and I barked out “I’M CHECKING!!!”  Immediately calming things down, dad of the year here, guys.

The zoo’s website said they were open with limited visitors who had to request an appointment to limit entrance amounts, even members!! Luckily they were still going to have the food carts open, one restaurant/grill, but everything indoor would be closed and no meet the zookeepers talks which is really sad because I wanted to get some easy 1-on-1 time while no one was there I thought. 

Surprisingly there we’re still tickets available left at $0 for members and now that we had an prev. booked appointment and/obligation, reason to travel, were good to be the proper citizens we were at the zoo - social distilling ourselves safely from the gen. pub. 

We booked the tickets but ultimately were unable to attempt due to a fight over an umbrella shaped like a giraffe (since it was 65 and partly sunny outside at the time.) 

Now there’s an argument over which animated bullshit goes on the TV and I’m thinking what can I do outside while it’s still nice and not there are no structure fires during the open stages of the  collapse of the American Emprire, *brought to you by FOX.* Maybe go to the skatepark, or get some fish from the pet store.",Denver,"[None of this is untrue (the tone is exaggerated, satirical, and I went for a hindsight’d self-immolation/roast-theme)...’but it’s why we’re fucked and things are likely to get worse.

My name is Hunter and I work with Styria Bakery II. You may have seen our Austrian bakery at local farmers' markets and/or trade shows around Denver providing the best bread, pretzels, and pastries here in town.

Like so many others, this pandemic is affecting not only our personal lives but our local businesses as well. Being a family-owned and operated company ourselves, we are doing our best to keep our doors open to the public, especially as our local stores continue to be ravaged on a daily basis.

We will be baking to fit the orders we receive so if you would like to partake please feel free to message me directly on here or reach out to the phone number or email I will post below.

Please visit our website, which you can find below, in order to have a full view of the different variety of baked goods we offer. Notice: some of the pastry items will not be available, but all bread varieties will be. Prices are as follows:

* All breads- $6 per loaf
* Bavarian Pretzels- $4
* Stollen- $12
* Apple Strudel- $18 

Pick up times will be between 12:30-2:00 pm.

Please, please, please learn to compromise on what you want to eat. We may not have your favorite flavors. We may only have one type of rice, beans, pasta, if we have them at all. Things might not be over the right price tag, we have to put out whatever food we can, wherever we can fit it.

We all have a social responsibility to take only what we need, and make sure our neighbors and community stay fed too. There's not an official limit on how much food you can take, but don't be that asshole that takes all of the ramen, rice, pasta, etc off the shelf. For many stores that's all the food we have on the shelf for days at a time. You aren't just taking all of the food from the store, you're taking it from an entire community.

Grocery employees are working extremely long hours in dangerous conditions we were never prepared for. I personally have worked 12 hour shifts for the past 3 days with only today off, being exposed to hundereds and hundreds of people. Many people are asking what they can do to help. Honestly, the best thing you can do is be kind to one another, be understanding, be thankful for what you have. Say thank you, buy your stockers something to drink (we love energy drinks and coffee lol), and please don't cough on us.

I was wondering what you all may think about finding a rental during this outbreak. Two friends and I are looking to sign a year long lease in the next few days. We found a gorgeous house right outside of five points for what we seem to believe is reasonably priced. I’m not worried about job stability (oh how nice it is to work in epidemiology right now) but moreso concerned about getting the best deal. I see a lot of rental properties lowering their prices. I’ve been told by friends I could get a place seriously discounted since the majority of people are not looking to make such a transition/commitment at this time. 
So for those who have a better sense of real estate and the economy than me, is it possible to negotiate a better deal? 
We are currently looking at a 3/2 single family home that was originally priced at 3,400, lowered to 3,000 a week later due to “no central AC installed” and already was able to knock $100 off the rental price. We already asked if it was possible to lower to $2800 but was rejected. We have all turned in our applications and will most likely be given leases to sign tomorrow. 
What sort of negotiation would be fair at a time like this?

We are considering both online an in-person care. We are willing to provide PPE and would also provide appropriate training in regards to how to protect yourself as much as possible.

BACKGROUND

I am (30/f) originally from Maine and have lived in: West Virginia, San Francisco, San Diego, and London.

What I love about LA: restaurants, temperature weather, diversity, superb comedy shows, educated &amp; ambitious population, and close proximity to hikes/beach. 

What I think I will like about Denver: seasons, a great dating scene for women, proximity to the outdoors, affordable, walkable, and direct flight to Maine.

Everyone in my household is service industry, and a couple of us will likely not make rent this month.  I know everyone is recommending grocery stores and Amazon warehouse jobs right now, but I've applied online, and in person at my local grocery, and keep getting the run around from people that come off too busy to really worry about people, and they obviously don't have a problem finding people at the moment.  The Amazon warehouse in Thornton had a job fair last weekend, but when I got there, they were cancelling it, and telling everyone to apply online, because the line was packed into a small space and everyone was coughing on each other with no standing room. 

A friend put me in touch with a job placement agency, that was supposed to be placing people at King soopers faster than just applying directly through them.  I was able to sort of find work through them, but it comes with a lot of strings.  First of all you have to spend all day driving around to fax/scan all the necessary documents.  This includes meeting someone you're not related to, and don't live with, in person to verify your documents are real, and they have to give their information and vouch for you I guess.  After all that is done, you get work on a week to week basis as a 1099 contractor.  They schedule you for around 48 - 56 hours a week, and you don't get overtime.  On top of that, you really only get the shit work at the store, you have to get multiple signatures before you leave every day, the store stamp, then scan the document that was signed and stamped, and upload it back to the agency.  After that, they will send you a link to a survey, which you have to take, everyday, or every shift, in order to get paid.  I don't want to come off as being too good for all this, because I'll do it.  I just wonder what everyone else is doing, and if there's better options.

I'm also an I.T. professional, but gave up my career 3 years ago to move to this amazing place, and I'm pretty sure most of those gigs aren't hiring at the moment, because they don't want to hire more people that just want to work from home.  Any suggestions, or shared stories would be greatly appreciated.  Hope you're all staying safe out there.",Denver,What are the service industry people doing for work?

3996,3996,cynderisingryffindor,1584974933,fnl5t0,Nan,"Please, let me start from the beginning. I moved from India to Texas in 2012 for school. In India I always felt like the odd one out. I was, and am, a tremendous nerd, a tomboy etc. In Texas, I felt like I was home. In 2 weeks, I met my best friend. In 8 months, I met my future husband (also a colossal nerd). I got married in Texas, adopted my dogs and cats in Texas, got my masters and PhD in Texas, and had a kid in Texas. 

We moved to Denver with tonnes of excitement, because 1). Got a dream job here, 2). Bought a house. You know, big girl things. My toddler loves it here. I think, most of our pets love it here. However, apparently, Denver seemingly hates me. At the start of our stay, I got really sick (don't worry, nothing to do with covid 19). Then at the start of March, we lost 2 of our turtles. They just passed away. Granted, turtles are finnicky, but my husband has been raising them since he was 10, and he knows how to deal with them. But I understand that shit happens. I'm not gonna blame y'all for those freak accidents. 

Yesterday, our dogs escaped. We've three dogs. 2 biggish ones (a catahoula mix and a husky) and a tiny mop looking Yorkie mix. We found the big ones pretty soon, as usual. However, we couldn't find the Yorkie mix, her name's Eevee. She got me out of my depressive funk. She's adorable and goofy. We spent the entire day trying to find her. I posted on Craigslist, and petharbor, and called the shelters. I finally got an email in the evening from this dude who apparently had stolen my Eevee and was trying to blackmail me for money. Who TF would do that? Whyyyy would someone do that? I've literally been crying since yesterday. At least, Eevee is oblivious enough to still love that dick waffle. 

As a scientist I know that idiot DOESN'T represent all you wonderful people. However, that cavewoman part of brain is equating him to Denver hardcore. I'm sorry, but I'm disappointed, Denver.

I couldn’t help but sense some frustration from the manager. 

Now I’m feeling guilty but I don’t think I should have to feel this way.

I don’t feel good about taking that risk at all. I also don’t have health insurance. I’m sure everyone is aware of the current situation but I’m just looking for some support. 

I don’t think it’s fair to me or my coworkers that I even have to make that decision. I could potentially be putting everyone at risk but it’s seems like no one cares about that at all.

I’m not looking for a handout but based on every other similar store’s response to this situation, it doesn’t seem right that we’re still open.

We're all in an economic pinch with the virus quarantine, but I believe we can still build up each other's businesses if we unite during this period. With so many business owners needing to change tactics to keep them, their family, and employees afloat, I thought it would be a huge boost for everyone if we had a group to promote what hacks we're employing to stay open.

The idea of this group is to give businesses a focused platform where they can share their businesses with other owners and how they're handling the quarantine. I'm thinking of featuring businesses, doing interviews, or maybe highlighting specials or pro-bono services, I'm just trying to help my friends and family who are under the unique pressure of having a business.

My goal is to also connect people in dire need of services with businesses offering them. I'd love it if we could help out our communities with reduced prices, or again, pro-bono services. I know we all have people we care about affected by the virus and economy, whether it's people who can't get products or services, or businesses who can't stay operational. This is a chance for us to not only stay alive and survive, but to thrive by working together.

I encourage you to invite as many business owners as you know to the group. And if you have any solid ideas on how we can boost other businesses and/or help those in need, don't hesitate to let me know so we can work on bringing that to the group.",Denver,I'm Trying to Help Small Business Owners in Colorado

Members of Mountain View Friends Meeting, a longtime Quaker presence in South Denver, are opening their place of worship as lodging for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers treating patients with COVID-19. The meeting house is available for three healthcare professionals to live under the principles of the Frontline Houses Movement, which began in Phoenix, AZ last week. There will be no charge to residents to stay at the Meeting house, which has stood vacant since social distancing efforts began. Other area faith communities are considering similar measures.

Healthcare workers on the front line of the pandemic are faced not only with the awareness that in doing their jobs they may become ill themselves, but also the fear of inadvertently bringing the virus home and infecting loved ones. Frontline Housing lessens that worry, as well as providing emotional support and a sense of community.

Residents must agree to shower after every shift, wipe down household surfaces, record and post their temperatures on a white board daily, and agree to care for each other if a resident becomes sick. To be eligible, applicants must show proof of healthcare employment, medical insurance and permanent housing (their own home or apartment). To apply, contact Mountain View Friend Diane D’Angelo at 602-405-5134 or [Dangelo.diane@gmail.com](mailto:Dangelo.diane@gmail.com) . A Facebook Group has been created to support local healthcare workers interested in Frontline Housing and as a way for property owners to list their own dwellings in the effort. It is listed as #Frontlinehouses – Denver.",Denver,Quaker Meeting House to Launch #Frontline House – Denver: Lodging for Healthcare Workers

My  adoption was awaiting approval when the first wave of corona shutdowns  started taking effect. The local Animal Shelter, being a location for  public gathering, delayed all adoptions. Following similar precautions  my adoption has been postponed until further notice.

I  want to maintain social distancing and do what I can to help everyone  in this situation including donating blood as soon as I can. I live  alone however. knowing I need the companionship for my mental health and  well being, I am well aware of the kind of reaction I have to look  forward to if I continue this quarantine for as long as necessary. I am  attempting to write and distract myself with media as much as possible,  naturally I just wish I could spend time with an animal that I can now  give even more time to.

I live in  Denver Colorado and wanted to ask how others felt about the idea of  trying to find a pet during this time? I have not heard any information  about dogs specifically being able to transfer this illness, and I want  this to encourage and improve my social distancing efforts. It would  tremendously help with long and short term mental health as well. None  of that is worth the cost of potentially harming others in a more  desperate situation however.

The  other consideration is that all the regular channels for adoption have  been closed to me, but there must be animals who still need homes, not  as if we can tell them to stop being born or growing up. I know there  are still plenty of situations out there that would mutually benefit  from my potential financial and physical dedication to a dog in need.   If it is not deemed immoral to do so, can anyone out there recommend or  suggest a way to do this in the age of contagion?",Denver,Contagious Friends

#Most Important Advice to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19:


- Wash your hands frequently, for 20 second (about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" from start to finish) washing all parts including between fingers. Hand sanitizers may be used as a substitute, but hand washing is preferable. Moisturizing soap will help prevent over-drying your hands. 

- Stay home unless it is important to leave. Avoid gatherings of people, especially large ones and try to maintain a social distance of 6-feet from other people. Avoid shaking hands

- Avoid Touching your face, eyes, and mouth especially with unwashed hands. If you cough, use your elbow rather than your hands.

- Sanitize doorknobs, counters, sink faucets and other frequently touched surfaces. First clean, then you can use disinfectant wipes, [diluted bleach ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html), full strength hydrogen peroxide, or a disinfectant spray to kill any virii that may be on the surface.

- Don't hoard needed items; don't be a stupid, selfish asshole.

So many equally caring and dedicated operators knew their best decision was to close immediately last week and get their crew filing for unemployment ASAP, and while we're evaluating everything day by day here, we weren't ready to make that call.  Even if we're running at a loss, if we can keep them employed with anything close to their normal take home (managers keep salary, our kitchen crew are making what they normally do, just the servers are taking a hit now, because tips), that is at least better than waiting 4-5 weeks for something like a third of their pay on unemployment. 



Safety, health, and proper distancing are our biggest priorities and we're running a tight operation, but as long as we can cook safely and people want to eat (and drink now with to go booze!), we're going to keep trying. The first week was encouraging, thanks to so many of our regulars and we're working on a program to try to feed laid off industry people and our amazing community of health care workers for free as the weeks go on. We're lucky enough to be frugal operators and business was good until all this, so we're digging deep and trying to do the best we can.



Please consider us (spuntinodenver.com) for lunch or dinner. While we're not a cheap restaurant (the whole local/ethical sourcing thing, making everything from scratch, fair pay, etc), we stand by the value and quality of everything we serve always and we would love to cook for you. 



Stay safe and sane out there. If you're in laid off from the restaurant industry or work on the front lines in healthcare and could use a warm meal, reach out (spuntino@spuntinodenver.com). We've got you. Thank you for reading and for those of you who can afford to, please look to your community to support small businesses.

I consider myself very fortunate that I will be receiving job attached unemployment from the state plus min wage compensation from my employer until we reopen. It is nowhere near what I normally make but It  is just enough to pay my bills and survive.  I’m incredibly thankful we have a social safety net for the hundreds of thousands of people like me and I’m very thankful to get the unemployment pay plus a little from my work. 

Where I get incredibly mad is that I talk to my friend who is a receptionist at an emergency room for UC health. Who has to wear full protective gear and get her temperature gauged just to clock in. I talk to another friend who got a job at King Soopers coming into contact with hundreds of people a day. Another friend who’s trying to work for Amazon where you don’t even get sick pay. All of them are putting their health in danger and are some of the only types of workers keeping our society functioning. My friends are all making similar money or barely more than someone in my shoes who’s sitting safely at home not working and just collecting a check. The system is messed up. Unemployment insurance is incredibly important and this isn’t a knock on it. 

I need this money to survive. I even chose to not renew my lease and move into a friends extra room in their house to save money. My point isn’t that I or other people like me should be getting less, it’s that essential employees should be getting a lot more. We could argue where that money should coming from but I’m not seeing many employers or government officials stepping up to the plate and putting their money where there mouth is. I really hope that changes and I really hope it permanently changes.

Do not travel by vehicle, period, except to access or provide essential services. For must of us this is food and medical needs, but other specifics are listed as well, see the link to your area for details. Human-powered locomotion is allowed if you want to get outdoors to exercise, take the dog out, to enjoy nature, or to get fresh air.

You can visit the parks and trails, and walk your neighborhood, but you must social distance, and all facilities are closed, including playgrounds, sports facilities, workout equipment, etc. Try not to lay around or loiter. You can bike, walk, run, birdwatch, do photography, or do other activities alone; groups are only allowed if everyone in the group shares the same residence.

You can work from home, but you may not have others who do not normally share your residence in your home for any reason. If you have out of town visitors who are now stuck, I recommend calling your county's health office for instructions.

You can not invite people over, or congregate in public. Exception for those with whom you share a residence, eg. you can go running with your roommate (but not your neighbor).  


Dates may vary a bit by county.

I was surprised to see numerous large groups of people walking together or hanging in the parks. I heard some real strange comments about it’s less serious than flu (not true) and I saw people just not respecting personal space (6 ft if you can manage) and people in the grocery store handling products and then putting them back. I even saw a woman hitch a ride with a family of strangers in the grocery store parking lot. So I just wanted to do a little PSA post we can all participate in. 

Colorado is a high risk situation right now and Denver is the epicenter of infection with the most confirmed cases and also the most people traveling through. It’s very important that we all understand the seriousness of Covid 19 and adapt our behavior to make this whole mess and all its potential repercussions as minimal and short lived as possible. I know the median age here is young and we’re generally healthy people but we have a responsibility to curb the spread of this pandemic. I’m saying stay home alone, don’t go out if you don’t have to, don’t get close to people, don’t touch things and if you do wash your hands in soap and hot water for twenty seconds. These are the basics. 

There are plenty of ways to stay in contact with people you care about that don’t involve leaving your house or seeing them in person. Do those. 

Who else has some sound advice?

Edit: Alcohol, drugs, and even cigarettes are not essential people. I speak as someone who loves them all but has recently given them up. It ain’t easy, but you’re not going to be able to get them in the hospital. This virus is incredibly infectious and is spreading like fire. If you get it you’re likely to give it to someone you love, and people of all ages are subject to fatality from it. If you’re dealing with addiction this might be a good time to learn some self restraint. Those who drink and smoke regularly are at higher risk. I’m not on a high horse because I’m sober, I’m just trying to encourage people to think about doing something good for themselves and everybody else.",Denver,Does anybody else feel like maybe not enough of us are taking Covid seriously enough or responding to the stay home order appropriately?

I have done everything I can to continue reaching out to those in need despite the current crisis, continuing to give food, clothes, and comfort goods like hand sanitizer to those stuck on the streets, but today made me want to finally throw in the towel.

My wife and I both work for ""essential"" employers, so every day we board our buses and continue to try and earn our keep while helping others.  Today RTD continued their pattern of negligence, allowing homeless passengers to pile onto the bus, often without paying, which allowed a disturbed individual to intentionally attempt to spread disease during a time of crisis.  A disheveled passenger boarded the early morning 15 bus at the Colfax &amp; High stop, and proceeded to argue with the driver to be admitted without payment, as well as aggressively approaching other passengers after the driver admitted them, forcing himself into close proximity demanding money and coughing on those who refused, smiling and speaking about the current pandemic as he did so.  The situation escalated until multiple passengers demanded he be removed, the driver and an upstanding citizen physically forced him off the bus at Colfax &amp; Park, but by that time he had basically assaulted several passengers, engaging in acts that are being legally deemed as terrorism during the current crisis (threats of maliciously spreading the virus).  

I give up.  I'm done trying to keep people alive who just want everyone around them to suffer the way they have.  I grew up an orphan, experienced that reality, chose to rise above and help others, only to be literally spit on by those I have attempted to help.  The wealthy of this city are getting extra time to walk the parks and rest, while hourly workers face daily risk.  Companies and individuals alike should both feel shame for their behavior during this crisis, every landlord should be waving rent, every corporation should be covering sick time, but they're too busy maintaining profits, I honestly feel ashamed for giving up on homeless outreach, but I just can't do it anymore.

In order to help our community with the Covid-19 pandemic, we have bottled 264 six-pack cases of 64oz bottles of alcohol-based liquid hand sanitizer. Our hand sanitizer is compliant with the World Health Organization and contains 80% alcohol. 

Due to bottle shortages and limited supplies all across the country, we don’t have access to sprayers or pumps at this time. This product is perfect to refill your bottles at home however, in an effort to reduce, reuse and recycle! 

We understand this is a difficult time for many and want to ensure that everyone takes the necessary precautions and has access to supplies that can help them be safe and healthy.

Liquid hand sanitizer 64oz bottles will be available to purchase for $27.90 at our dock.

While supplies last. First come first serve. We ask that people please follow the social distancing guidelines.

In regards to BYOB (Bring your own bottle) as of tomorrow, we will not be refilling bottles as we aren't equipped well to do so, not to mention we are also short on PPE. However,  depending on how tomorrow goes we will consider this as an option in the future. 

 Mods, I am aware that this breaks the rules as it is technically is self-promotion but our intent is not to profit from this. We, like any small business, are just trying to keep the lights on in this trying time. We only hope to give back to the community any way we can.",Denver,Hand sanitizer update!

I work as an ABA Therapist and therefore was still attending work until Wednesday, when my client came into contact with someone with COVID-19, so my work ordered me to self-quarantine. I have been self-quarantining away from my home out of respect for my landlord/other roommate (3 of us in the house altogether).

DM me if you can help or want more details. We get out of this by taking care of each other. Stay safe.

My name is Dr. Maheswaran Dhanasekaran, one of the doctors working at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, NY. As you are very well aware that NYC is the hardest hit place for Corona Virus and the number of patients getting admitted to the hospital is exponentially increasing day by day and the visitation policy has been cancelled in the interest of the public to prevent them from getting infected. 


As you can think as a telecommunication network provider how you can help and wonder what you can do. I strongly believe this corona virus is testing the humanity its strength and its resilience. We wont give up until the very end. 


I am pleading you all if you could help donating some communication devices to our hospital as the patients who are admitted to the hospital are getting sicker every day thinking that this is their end. These are the times that every soul will long to be with their loved ones. But unfortunately, it is not possible. Just like one of the article in NYtimes mentioned, ""If you have coronavirus, you die alone"". I wish at least if we could get your help with some communication devices to our hospital, we could let the patient's loved ones to call the patient and say their good byes via voice call or video calls though the patient is intubated. I believe it will give the family members peace of mind.  


I am sincerely pleading everyone working in the telecommunication network to consider this request and help us serve the humanity during this difficult timings!!

Can this be correct? According to the city's website, they only investigate noise complaints Monday-Friday, 7:30 am - 4:30pm? 

So basically they don't investigate at all. I would assume the bulk of noise complaints happen outside of those hours. (Also I know they're not doing anything now that we're in the grips of CoronaVirus). I have a neighbor who plays his music so loud I can hear it across the street with every door and window closed. It's not like I can go anywhere now to escape his music. Do I have any rights at all here?

I've talked to him about it multiple times but I think he's intoxicated every time so it's a real possibility he does not remember speaking to me about it.

At first we decided to offer them every understanding that a normal urban neighbor could expect - not to get upset about unusual hours, occasional parties, and so on, but the amount of visitors to our cul-de-sac has gone through the roof.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

It has been 15 days now and I still haven't received the PIN number in the mail. 

Actually no communication at all and of course, it's impossible to even speak to someone on the phone because of the sheer call volume. I have coworkers though, who applied when I did (and even after) that received their PINs, and already requested and received their first payments. 

I totally understand the system is backlogged right now, but I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced these kinds of delays? If not, how do I go about checking to see the status of my claim? I'm afraid to refile because I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to scam anyone. Just trying to get 2/3 of my salary and make it thorugh these very uncertain next few months like everyone else.

Hi Friends, 

For those of you who don't know, the man next to me in this photo is my amazing Dad (ed. photo not posted) He's the most supportive, amazing father that anyone could ask for and an anesthesiologist who has devoted his life to making healthcare safer for patients. 

He needs your help. He's currently fighting for his life, intubated in the ICU in Colorado with COVID 19. He's really sick despite receiving the best health care anyone could ask for. His medical team thinks that he may benefit from convalescent plasma, ie a blood donation with antibodies from someone who has had COVID 19 and recovered. Currently his hospital does not have an established donor program for this, however if we find a suitable donor, they would be able to donate to Dad through the American Red Cross. 

If you or anyone you know has tested positive for COVID 19 greater than 14 days ago, has been asymptomatic for 14 days and would be willing to donate plasma in the Denver area please let me know. If not, sharing this post far and wide would also be a tremendous help.

 Veterans, can you join us for the first [**#VBCDenver**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=vbcdenver&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6650755310166294528) virtual meetup tonight (April 1st) at 6:00pm MST?  


We'll have a Colorado state representative with us to discuss the government's plans for combating Covid-19 (including employment info and economic outlook), as well as peer to peer job seeking information that is more important now than ever, and the usual camaraderie we enjoy at every VBC meetup.  


This meetup is especially for veterans who are looking for work, can help a fellow veteran find work, or just enjoy being in the company of other veterans over beers in a casual environment.   


If you're getting cabin fever, come network with other veterans over a pint of beer - a virtual happy hour with information to serve the veteran community in Denver!  


We welcome ALL active duty or transitioning military, veterans, and spouses!  


**If interested, please PM me and I will send you the Zoom meeting link/login info** (we're keeping it private up to the last minute to avoid spammers from joining - these are not traditional business networking events and we don't want anyone pitching/hawking/pandering to vets).

One of my close friends is a firefighter and I thought I might honor his hardwork and sacrifice, and that of his colleagues, by doing the same. I pooled some cash from our friend group and paid a local pizzeria to make his station dinner for the evening as well as some take and bake calzones for later. 

It's hard to know how to fight back against this Pandemic in anything but a passive manner. It's frustrating, especially when you know there are EMS, Police, Nurses, and Doctors working extended hours at great personal risk on the front lines. It felt good to feed those firefighters and the gratefulness in their eyes let me know it was greatly appreciated. The look of gratitude was evident on the face of the owner of the pie shop too; local business are hurting for sales and they're doing everything they can to keep their employees paid and the lights on.

If you feel so called I'd encourage you to contact your local emergency services, whether it's a fire dept or a hospital or whatever, and see if they would appreciate (and allow) a similar gesture. Let's support and feed our Emergency Medical Services and bolster our local economy.

Part of me would feel bad for those who would see their homes value drop but Denver averaged 11% annual housing price gains the past decade which is absolutely nuts and not sustainable, and any homebuyer should have been aware of this fact. 5+ years ago, it wasn’t hard for your average Denverite to buy a home, but now your median family income can’t even come close to affording  the median house in greater Denver and that needs to change. Average people have been priced out of being able to afford a decent home and now it takes an average income well over 6 figures to afford a decent home. 

As of now banks are allowing people to put off mortgage payments so foreclosures will be low, and I don’t expect a hit on the housing market like we saw in ‘08, but it’s hard to think there won’t be some sort of dip in the market over the next year or so.

10 minutes later, I get a call, that again informs me that my modem is offline, and need to power cycle it, before I can speak to an agent. Thinking perhaps I screwed up previously, I accept and wait for them to call back.

 Although Denver’s iconic concert venue Red Rocks Amphitheater is currently a ghost town amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Denver City Council voted on two taxpayer-funded contracts with AEG and Live Nation.

According to [***DenverRite***](https://denverite.com/2020/03/31/why-denver-is-dangling-10-million-in-front-of-the-worlds-largest-concert-promoters-even-as-live-music-goes-quiet/), the agreements with the world’s two largest concert promoters totaled $10.5 million and are good through 2022. The deals lock the city into paying the companies if and when they book or promote shows at city-owned venues like Red Rocks, the Denver Colosseum, and the Denver Performing Arts Complex. However, this $10.8 million is not guaranteed, as they are only incentives to hold shows at city-owned venues, rather than Denver’s other[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/denver-city-council-aeg-live-nation/)",Denver,"Denver City Council Questions AEG, Live Nation Contracts in Light of Virus"

As a result of the virus my videography work is non-existent. I am aware that I would be available to apply for unemployment once the state unemployment offices start accepting gig unemployment applications.

However, I applied for a 2-month temp job as a work at home CSR. The work only pays $13 an hour and it is way below my current technical and skill level. It is as entry-level as entry level can get and my career and my resume would show that I'm above this.

Luckily, I don't have to accept this position as I am doing fine financially. 

My question is, does anyone know or have any advice affects my potential unemployment benefits. Meaning being that I was offered this job do I have to accept it? Or does the unemployment office even have to know that I was offered the job? 

Would I be disqualified from benefits because I was offered the job? I know that there is a lot unknown about how gig workers can apply but I was just asking here before I officially rejected the offer

I worked as a bartender in Boulder County until I was laid off on Wednesday, March 18. I struggled through the unemployment claim website for a week and finally got my claim submitted on Tuesday, March 24. I did get to the page where I received a confirmation number and email. I have been waiting since then to receive my PIN in the mail but it has still not arrived--my roommate applied a few days after me and has already received hers. I have received no other emails from Colorado Unemployment since.

The FAQ \[here\]([https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/unemployment-frequently-asked-questions](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/unemployment-frequently-asked-questions)) says if you have not received your PIN in the mail within seven days of submitting your claim, you should call the Customer Contact Center at 1-800-318-9000 for Denver Metro area. I have called this number dozens of times since Wednesday and it rings once, plays a busy signal, and drops the call with the message ""User Busy.""

Since it's Friday and I assume the help center will be closed throughout the weekend, I'm starting to sweat a bit. Is there anything I can do other than continue trying the helpline? Has anyone else's PIN taken &gt;10 days to be mailed? Is there another phone number I can try? Or, if nothing else, is there anyone else experiencing this same problem?

I know a lot of us are in this together and I hope everyone else's unemployment process is as painless as possible and everyone is staying healthy the best they can!

Our entire business seeks to invest in the folks we work with – from our producer partners to everyone in our organization to you all on the other side of the counter.

If you’re into this, please go all in with us and other companies that are committed to a similar vision. If you can’t get behind this – we’re not the company for you.⁣

I am a huge fan of Los Chingones and would be at their DTC location right now for happy hour if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic.  My fiance and I are making tacos at home tonight and I am craving the Los Chingones Habanero salsa.  It's really hot, kind of orange in color, and somewhat sweet.  It's so hot I need to keep eating it to somehow prevent the burn.  I bought some roasted tomato salsa from Trader Joe's and am planning on putting some habanero peppers, honey, and pineapple in it but I wasn't sure if anyone actually had the recipe or something similar.  That would be super cool!  Also any suggestions on a salsa recipe would be great!  I don't mind roasting my own tomatoes and peppers but for the sake of time tonight I am going to cheat a bit.

So, if you are one of those going to drugstores, grocery stores, liquor stores or dispensaries during this pandemic, and complaining about any shit, you are not understanding whats going on. Man, pay more attention. First: we are opened! People are exposing themselves to a health risk and trying to keep their essential jobs. Say thanks to anyone thats working right now. And also, isn't that awesome that we can still buy the shit we need? OK. I work in a dispensary\* and in our state cannabis is considered essential, so lets first celebrate. But yeah, a lot of people need the same as you do, so you wlll probably find a line. To avoid lines, as a suggestion, go to any dispensary in the first or last hour of the day. If they close at 8pm, go at 7pm. As we are in the middle of a pandemic, unfortunately, you cannot see the buds before buying anymore, nothing can be opened inside the store since march 17, new rules, health products. The cannabis industry changes fast and we all know about that. For the last 2 weeks we are asking people to order online (but if you dont, you still can shop), so, to be nice, you can try to use the internet (it works pretty good) or at least check the menu online to know what you want when you get there, and be fast. You still have to come to pick it up and pay with cash. Nothing new, right? Most of these you always did before, but why things are so strange now? Cuz now people are ONLY getting out from their homes to go to the dispensary, liquor or grocery store. So next time you leave your little hell home to go anywhere, try to remember that this are strange times for everyone. people are working, so, the dispensary or the grocery store are NOT A PLACE TO COMPLAIN. Be fast, buy what you need, try not to throw your stress on others and go back home. If you hate your husband or wife, get divorced, find an online lover, I dont care. But we are still working, so if youre gonna leave your house to be stressed at any shop, PLEASE STAY HOME.

There is a church in my apartment building that still regularly has service (3+ times a week), all of which have a significant number of attendees.

We have tried calling them and they simply do not answer or tell us not to call. We have reached out to our land lord and although we share a building they technically own a separate part of it and he has no power to stop them. We reluctantly reached out to a non emergency line as we did not want to add stress to the system and they seemed not to do anything either, as the services are still happening.

#Most Important Advice to Prevent the Spread of Covid-19:


- Wash your hands frequently, for 20 second (about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" from start to finish) washing all parts including between fingers. Hand sanitizers may be used as a substitute, but hand washing is preferable. Moisturizing soap will help prevent over-drying your hands. 

- **Stay at home unless it is important to leave.** Avoid gatherings of people, especially large ones and try to maintain a physical distance of 6-feet from other people. Do not shake hands.

- Avoid touching your face, eyes, and mouth especially with unwashed hands. Cough into your elbow rather than your hands. 

- Sanitize doorknobs, counters, sink faucets and other frequently touched surfaces. First clean, then you can use disinfectant wipes, [diluted bleach ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html), full strength hydrogen peroxide, or a disinfectant spray to kill any viruses that may be on the surface.

- Don't hoard needed items; don't be a stupid, selfish asshole.

4850,4850,OldWorldMaster,1586020256,fuxbiz,Nan,"Ok so, I was just outside my apartment with my dog and was approached by a young woman. I thought nothing of it at first, like oh she’s probably starved for attention from this COVID shit.... She starts complimenting me about my hoodie and asking questions about it. Then the topic switched from my hoodie to what I’m doing to stay healthy, if I work from home, what do I do for work, eventually leading to “are you looking for another source of income?” And that leads to “I moved here from Texas and I was lucky enough to meet this couple who was willing to teach me...”  

Right then and there, in my head I’m like nope nope nope nope nope, this EXACT conversation has happened to me before with a totally different young woman at a Target about 5-6 miles from where I live, back in December.

So in December I had just entered Target and a young woman approached me about my earrings (they are pretty cool, moose antler spirals in a 5/8 size), she showered me with all sorts of compliments and then a million fucking questions. Those questions started evolving into where I was from, how long I’ve lived here, what brought me here, what do I do for work and am I looking for an alternative source of income and interested in being financially free... into “I was lucky enough to meet this couple who took me under their wing, and they’re teaching me everything they know. If you’re serious about making money, you should take my number.”

Now I’m really curious who this fucking couple is, and what kind of cult ponzi shit are they pulling? And what the hell is it about me that puts a target on my forehead for the exact same thing to happen to me twice?! 🤣 🤣

I hope if you are reading this, that you are doing well during these strange times.

My family and myself are trying to adjust to the, what seem like, daily changes. 

The new school closure being extended makes me anxious. Living in an apartment with no porch that we can barely afford.  

I am wondering, if there happens to be anyone out there who happens to need help with childcare, but in exchange can offer reduced rent for a small family (Husband, 6-yr old, Mother). 

I myself am having to stay home now, and therefore am not able to work my usual full time job.

I would love to answer any questions and give you all my background and undergo background checks, etc if you are in need of a live-in caretaker, but are also in a position to house three people. 

If this happens to be you or someone you know, feel absolutely free to contact me.

Preferably would like to stay within the Lakewood-Denver area. Husband has secure-essential-work &amp; commutes to Commerce City. 

I am trying to gauge-see-and-plan for a future (months) of being confined to staying mostly home to take care of son. 

It has made the wheels turn in my head, hence this post. I would be honored to share the space and privilege of caring for someone else (I also have a special place in my heart for the elderly and disabled) and if the possibility exists and the vetting on both sides comes out clear, than I believe it could be a great way to maintain some routine and connection to other humans, with a mutually-beneficial outcome.

https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

(Filter for Colorado in the drop-down)

Anyways this past week every day our projections had us peaking mid to late April, going over our ICU beds and needed beds pretty significantly, roughly 80-90 deaths a day, and amassing about 3000 - 4000 deaths in the state.

Well I just looked at it right now and the numbers have PLUMMETED. What I'm seeing (in case it changes later) is that we peaked today at 14 deaths a day, and that we're no where near our ICU/ventilator needs. And that we're expecting about 300 total deaths...

Not to minimize those affected by this, but these numbers are fantastic...

Now I know this graph/data might not be 100% accurate (I've heard some scrutiny about the methods used). However... _something_ must have changed to drag those numbers down so significantly? Or is it some potential reporting error?

At the beginning of the quarantine, it was a multi-use green space for everyone in the neighborhood but the parks department has *really* cracked down this last week. 8 golf carts are patrolling at a time on the course and a parks department truck is constantly circling, giving out $100-$1000 fines. I watched one of them give a ticket to a young family having a picnic there yesterday. It seems a little ridiculous to have all of this beautiful wide open green space that’s paid for by the public and not let said public step foot on it especially during this time.

Just a quick question for those that have experience with UI in Colorado.

I just requested my first payment yesterday, and when I checked today, it said I had been paid out for the week already. I checked in my bank, and I haven't received anything. 

I assume it probably takes a couple days but I did opt into direct deposit, and now I'm paranoid that I put in the wrong info (even though I likely didn't, I'm just paranoid) and it doesn't seem like there's a way to check what your current direct deposit info is, just the option to change it.

Do I just need to wait a couple of days? I was going to call Unemployment but it seems like a trivial question, and with so many people trying to get through to the unemployment office I figured I'd ask around first.

My thoughts are that it's incredibly unlikely to catch the virus when you're out walking or running around your neighborhood (and this apparently isn't something that can be easily studied), so I don't think I'm planning to wear a mask during daily runs or walks. Of course, if everyone I see is wearing masks, I will probably be peer pressured into it. That said, if I do need to go to a store or something, I will likely wear a mask, more to protect others from me than vice versa. I have been making some masks for a friend to take to the hospital she works at (I leave them on her porch) so I will probably just hold onto a few for myself and my family.",Denver,Let's talk about masks

I was furloughed in March 17th.  I manage a breakfast restaurant that has closed it’s doors at 50% of locations.

My first attempt at filing was on March 19th. I set my alarm day after day attempting to file from 3am to sometimes 7pm. 

During this time I registered with the Workforce Center and uploaded a resume which is required.

The site being overloaded-I finally received confirmation and “got through” on March 24. 

My PIN arrived in the mail on March 28

Having the benefit of access to my employers’ mail and permission to open and process other employees’ claims...I know that my claim came in the same day as my PIN.

Using my PIN I changed my payment preferences and provided direct deposit information on March 29th

I had selected a “paperless” option so on the MyUI portal I printed my Identification Verification(this is required and there IS a deadline that is specified on your page/profile), filled out, signed, then copied 3x. I kept a copy, I faxed a copy 5x (with no luck-busy) and mailed a copy on March 30th.  Mailed another copy on April 1st just for good measure.  I also took pictures of the envelopes and kept the “busy” fax cover sheets...you never know.

Requested payment on the first day I was allowed to-which was April 5th. I did so at 3:30am (being accustomed to “normal working hours” overwhelming all sites related to unemployment).

Received payment exactly 24hrs later via direct deposit to my bank account. 

My claim status is STILL “Pending Approval” so I’m not out of the woods yet. 

Hope this helped somebody. Any questions are absolutely welcomed.

Newly active on Reddit here - more time on my hands than ever so I thought I’d finally enter the void.  Just wanted to ask the community what other avid houseplant enthusiasts / amateur gardeners are doing as far as continuing to propagate and add plants in their homes.  I live in an apartment and usually build my lineup using pothos and spider plant trimmings from the now-closed bar I work(ed) in, and would love to keep the habit going but I’m no longer sure where one can source from.  

All my local plant shops are closed, and Home Depot is still open but I’m trying to avoid stores with that much traffic (I’m guessing - haven’t been since the quarantine began).

Anybody have any creative resources?  Are there any places in the Denver area to forage/trim wild plants that could be propagated indoors?  Interested what other local green thumbs are coming up with.",Denver,Gardening in a quarantine

The following are critical market indicators for the Week of Monday, March 30th to Sunday, April 5th.

Data compiled from each of the three major MLS providers on the Front Range

New Listings:

2614 – Down 4% from prior week

Properties Under Contract:

1985 – Down 17% from prior week

Properties Withdrawn:

537 – Down 18% from prior week

Properties Sold:

2243 – Up 6% from prior week  

Properties Sold Year over Year in March comparison:

8764 – March 2019     8755 – March 2020    Nearly Identical!

What is encouraging is that in light of the market disruptions, there was not much change in the number of  March closings from 2019 to 2020.  For the most part people, under-contract made it to closing during challenging situations.   A more telling fact of how the COVID-19 situation is impacting real estate will be in data for April and May. Closings typically follow a 1-2 month lag from the under-contract date.

This is one of the first weeks we saw the number of new listings for sale drop.  Not a lot but this is the time of year that they typically increase week over week.  As mentioned last week this could likely be based on scheduled showings dropping 50% on a year-over-year basis.  Again, this is a sign that people are exercising caution and adhering to the recommendations of social distancing and stay at home orders.

While we expect there to be some slowing in real estate activity in the weeks moving forward, the current data is encouraging that the market has not paused or stopped.",Denver,Real estate update

172,172,brolome,1586286772,fwqlvb,Nan,"Just witnessed an unfortunate event nearby this morning. When I started my workday from home, about 6 homeless people congregated between my apartment building and the next door church and proceeded to get shitfaced drunk together. This resulted in two of them passing out on the asphalt, and when the church groundskeeper showed up he called 911. So 4 firefighters and 3 EMTs showed up to pick these guys up off the pavement.

The EMTs told them “If you don’t stand up for us right now we have to take you to the hospital. That’s not ideal for either of us right now.” and the dudes still refused to get up. Eventually, with a lot of help and encouragement, they did. Not sure if they still took a free ride to the hospital or not.

My small apartment building has a person with a serious preexisting lung condition as a resident so we’ve all taken extra precautions for her. I don’t want to interact with these people considering that and the extraneous conditions we’re in. I don’t want to call the police because they’re largely useless in my experience with them, plus it puts strain on their thin resources and exposes them to potential transmitters.

But it’s really awful to me that first responders time and effort plus the valuable PPE was wasted, let alone the risk of exposure from people who are clearly not practicing hygiene, distancing, or quarantining in any way. I understand homelessness is a heavy plight, but their behavior shows a blatant disregard for both others and themselves.

I have emailed the management company several times, however, all they say is to document it and call the police if he becomes violent. Although his behavior is disturbing, he has never behaved violently - on the contrary he seems very polite during the day - and I am not sure if he is breaking any laws although i do suspect he may have a drug problem. I have seen other neighbors confront him to no avail. 

The situation is making me feel extremely uncomfortable, bordering on unsafe. Also, sometimes I fear that others will act violently towards him.

Hope everyone is safe and healthy!

I moved from California to Colorado relatively recently, but am having some issues with the car registration portion. I am going to apply for a license transfer from CA to CO and have the necessary documentation already.

The registration part requires a VIN Verification and Title Complete Notice to proceed online. From my understanding, the VIN Verification has to be done in person, but all of the DMVs are currently closed. Additionally, I do not believe I received a Title Complete Notice for my car since it was titled in CA.

My car is a 2015 model, so it is exempt from the emissions test.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",Denver,Moved from California. Registration/VIN Verification?

My landlord was finally evicting her. She was supposed to be out end of March but then covid reared it's sickly head and the eviction was suspended until things subside. 
She is either on drugs or is bipolar, or both. She will go two days and not leave her bed and then will be up all night. She gives zero fucks now. She brought a new puppy home and now has a guy staying with her (as of last night). They were doing some malicious stuff...purposely dropping things right over our head intermittently all night.

An antibody plasma donation isn't a cure for cv19, someone needing a plasma donation would have to be hospitalized and currently in dire straights.   Even with donated antibodies there is no guarantee the patient would recover but I have heard that when it works, the recipient recovers faster.

How it would work:  People who had a positive cv19 test that have recovered and wish to donate would register with their blood type, email address OR SMS capable phone #.    This registry would be locked down and never shared.

When a hospital (and only a hospital) needs a donor with say AB- plasma, they could make a request with their agency name and contact details.   This would then be relayed onto all of the AB- donors and place the burden of scheduling a time to donate on them.   After a person has donated, they could update the registry to say they donated and be excluded for a week or two from further requests for donations.

I've got most of the software finished on my end and I have set aside some of my own money to host the application so this would be purely a humanitarian/non-profit deal.

Our bachelor male did have a female mate, but she has passed away, details if you'd like. The other cage has a male/female pair. They should be kept with a mate or in a large flock. Suggest finding new mate for lone male.

They are very sweet, and vocal. They are messy. They are a wild variety. They cannot be hand held. You need a special Finch food, and I am giving them away, as is in the 2 cages, because they need room to fly, so will not be able to go into a smaller cage. Much like how people mistakingly put Betta fish in small bowls. The cages cannot be kept close by as the birds turn hostile when hearing strange Finch noises, I suggest research if needed.

You may have one cage or both, no matter to us I want them to have a good home. I would only ask, $20 for supplies. Basically, $10 sell a cage. I can bring them within reasonable distance, we live in Broomfield. Or you may come collect.

I am posting here to gauge any interest in a protest in Denver to contest these uncalled for restrictions. I’m excited to hear from those of you who may be interested!",Denver,Lockdown Protest

I don't blame any restaurant for shutting down if it doesn't make financial sense to stay open, or if there are safety concerns. It just feels like a bad omen when even more restaurants start closing down.

I find one of the questions they ask a little confusing. 

 The last day on my job was March 28th. 

The question asks, have you stopped working for any employer between 3/29-4/5. I answered yes.

It then asks if you stopped working for any employer between 4/5-4/11. I answered that yes as well. 

Is yes the right response? Technically I’ve stopped working for any employer between those dates, but also technically I haven’t stopped working for an employer between those dates because I was laid off on the 28th. 

This questions is confusing to me. Would appreciate if someone let me know if yes was the right answer, or if no was the right answer did I screw my benefits or something?

It is a very sweet male dog that never makes a peep and is a bit thin. I moved in not long ago and saw at one point the dog was left on the balcony for as long as 18 hours at a time, and by the time it was brought in the balcony was covered in its feces and urine (obviously) and I had not seen it be fed in that time either. The dog spends the entire time on the balcony pacing and looking anxiously into the windows. I was hoping these bouts of neglect would end now that we’re all home but twice since mid March (now being the second time) i’ve seen him out there for over 8 hours and he is having to pace around his own feces and urine. I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do? I have seen him be taken out and walked 4 times since the lockdown started which makes it seem like maybe it will be better but these bouts of neglect are not okay. I don’t want to be confrontational because I had also seen the owner with an ankle monitor on when I moved in. It’s just really hard to watch.",Denver,My neighbor’s dog is neglected

I have a few questions concerning the Lakewood and Denver area as I've never ventured further than Colorado Springs, and I'm not very familiar with Lakewood, Denver, etc. 

I moved to Colorado not too long ago, and I've taken up residence in Colorado Springs. My boyfriend is planning on attending Red Rocks for Carpentry in a few years, and I'll most likely be transferring to University of Colorado Boulder to finish my degree. However, my boyfriend recently adopted a border collie mix as his ESA, and it turns out she was mixed with pit bull. Since we live in the Springs, it hasn't really been an issue since there's no laws or bans against them. 
Our problem would come from a relocation closer to the Denver area, so I'm trying to do as much research as I can beforehand, and I'm hoping you all can answer a few questions for me as I have no intentions of endangering our dog or breaking any laws.

1) Is it dangerous to move THROUGH Denver with a pitbull? (Not specifically taking her into Denver and going to parks and stuff. Mostly travel through the city without stopping) How strictly is it enforced? If I get pulled over with her in the backseat would they take her away, even if we're just passing through? 
2) If we fly back to Illinois, will she be prohibited from DIA due to her mix, even if she's an ESA? (I know some airlines also have restrictions and that's going to be a completely different thing I'll be looking into when that time comes) 
3) What are some recommended dog friendly outdoor places around Lakewood? 
4) Would it be better for us to stay in the Springs and commute daily or to move to Lakewood for a few years? 

Thank you guys! 
Please don't be too harsh on me. I'm just trying to do my best. I hope you all understand",Denver,Lakewood and Denver area and pitbulls.
