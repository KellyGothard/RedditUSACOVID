‚ÄúMost groundwater rights in Arizona are still based on the frontier legal doctrine of ‚Äúreasonable use,‚Äù which holds that a landowner retains the right to pump as much water as he or she pleases, so long as it‚Äôs put to a ‚Äúreasonable use‚Äù such as farming. In 1980, Arizona became the first state to pass groundwater reform, effectively deeming groundwater a public rather than a private resource. But in the years since, few regulatory safeguards have extended beyond the boundaries of Tucson and Phoenix. Outside those places, little has changed since statehood in 1912: A farmer needed only to file an Intent to Drill notice and pay a $150 permitting fee and was then free to pump as much as desired. For valley farmers, growing high-water crops like alfalfa and nuts, this often meant about 2,000 gallons, roughly the capacity of a tanker truck, every minute, 24 hours a day, with only intermittent breaks for several months. In 2017 alone, one farm pumped 22 billion gallons, nearly double the volume of bottled water sold in the United States annually.‚Äù

Wildlife is a non factor, don't worry about that. 

It's cold, so dress appropriately. If there's snow make sure you wear wool socks and at least mid level water resistant shoes with good grip because the rock faces get very slippery with snowfall. Depending on what shape you're in, hydrate well the night before/morning of and you should be good with 2-3 liters of water. Bring a few snacks like Clif bar or Kind bars. If the weather is nice and there's no snowfall then the hike is pretty easy and the only real risk is getting lost. 

Have the right vehicle to get you there. If the road is sloppy you're not getting there in a Camry. Watch the weather and read up on House Rock Road to make sure you're driving the right vehicle.

Bring a GPS with the route preloaded from whatever site you want. On our hike we helped 2 people get back on trail on the return who wasted an hour taking a bad route.

We are talking about numerous communities throughout the state. For example almost every community in Northern Arizona relies on the Coconino Aquifer, for water. Flagstaff, Show Low, Pinetop, Winslow, etc. Do you realize how many communities there are outside of the cities? So basically those people living in rural AZ should just suck it up, because the only population that matters are in either Phoenix Metro or Tucson?

Arizona is built on water law, we would still be an empty desert if it were not for very careful management of water resources. You don't see water there so you assume that everyone is just sucking it out of the ground with reckless abandon, and it just isn't true. For almost 20 years Salt River Project (power company in Scottsdale) methodically sued every municipality that touches the Verde River Watershed (along with many other private users) and the result has been the implementation of a very rigid set of restrictions on access to water in Central Yavapai county. Basically, all municipalities must recharge the aquifer with treated wastewater at a rate that is about 99% of the usage rate (In addition to permanently ""tabling"" an emergency supply). The recharged water basically seeps back into the aquifer over a long period of time and is not even able to be ""reused"" for a decades. Point being, if there is a problem it will be obvious for a long time coming.",1577849863,fcp43vo

You can plan on about a 2-1/2 hour detour off of 40 to get to the Canyon. There‚Äôs a $35 entrance fee per car into the park. The only way to get to the west area of the south rim is to go to Grand Canyon West, which is on Hualapai land and the tribe has their own set of fees to get in there; that is a long trip to get there because it‚Äôs in a very remote area. If you go to the South Rim, plan to spend some time there. It‚Äôs worth it, and the photos you see don‚Äôt even come close to doing it justice.

I personally dislike the major traffic increase,  especially in my area where it's mostly elderly drivers clogging the main roads at rush hour.  Aside from that, every winter visitor I've met has impressed me with how much they love our state, like we do, in the fair season. 

The fact that someone got so *bothered*, enough to pay to have cards made and then take the time to anonymously litter the inside of a walmart with them - that's 100 steps beyond anything I consider normal.  **And I'd bet you $1 million that the person who did it transplanted here from another state.** That makes me chuckle enough to share this post.",1578048747,fcx2trk

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I really like Phoenix, but there are some aspects of it that will eventually drive me away. The cost of living has risen exponentially over the last several years. I‚Äôve personally witnessed a significant increase in rent since moving here just 3 short years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

People are moving here in droves so the traffic is pretty congested (though they tend to keep up with the roads nicely and at least TRY to alleviate congestion with new lanes). The metro is  HUGE and divided into Phoenix, East Valley (Tempe, Gilbert, Chandler, Scottsdale) and West Valley (Peoria, Glendale, etc). People from East/West Valley rarely see each other‚Äôs side of town. You can drive an hour in any direction and still be in the metro. I don‚Äôt go into Phoenix much so I can‚Äôt speak for the neighborhoods there. I just stay in the East Valley mostly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The summers are insanely HOT. It‚Äôs normal to see triple digits from June through September. Winters are mild but can be on the chilly side. Light jacket is all you need and no snow. The sun shines almost every day, so that‚Äôs a huge perk. But you‚Äôll spent most of your time avoiding it because it will try to kill you. haha I do actually love the landscape out here. It‚Äôs oddly beautiful in an alien kind of way. If you love hiking, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Drivers are aggressive assholes. Besides the heat, drivers are my biggest gripe out there. You‚Äôll witness the most dangerous stupidity out there while driving. There‚Äôs a blaring undercurrent of competition and tension (maybe anger?) that I‚Äôve never seen on the roads before. 

&amp;#x200B;

There‚Äôs tons to do out here; you won‚Äôt be bored. Overall, I find people to be friendlier here than in some states I‚Äôve lived in. 

&amp;#x200B;

591,591,PinkyThePig,"To start, there are two programs that use the cloud plates:

1. The Energy Efficient plate program
2. The Alternate fuel plate program

\#1 is limited to 10,000 vehicles and since you can transfer the plate to a new fuel efficient vehicle you buy, the program ran out of plates years ago and has been out since. It applied to hybrids, such as a prius. This is the program ending on March 2020. AFAIK, you keep the plate, but you can no longer transfer it to new cars.

\#2 is for vehicles that are 100% alternate fuel. e.g. A BMW i3 **with** the gas range extender does not qualify, but a BMW i3 **without** the gas range extender does qualify. This program is not ending. With this program you get:

- HOV lane access
- Exempt from the every 2 year emission test requirement
- The option of a 5 year registration
- A dramatically reduced price for the vehicle license tax part of the registration. VLT is ~2.4% of what it costs for a gas car, and it bottoms out at $5/year. On a new car, this would result in a savings of a few hundred per year.",1578174411,fd55mhe

Go here, follow the road. In ideal weather conditions something like a Subaru can make it to the top without much fuss. In snow you'll want chains and preparations to get yourself unstuck if you slide off the road. Last time I went up there with snow on the ground quite a few trucks had slid off the main road. In that situation the forest rangers shut down the road where the snow started just so you're aware.",1578193729,fd6oa5p

You can head out west to old gold mine, or western town, or take a dinner boat cruise on a lake. The Zoo and Botanical gardens are good and worth seeing.

Here's the statute text: 

&gt;Unlawful feeding of wildlife; classification

&gt;A. A person commits unlawful feeding of wildlife by intentionally, knowingly or recklessly feeding, attracting or otherwise enticing wildlife into an area, except for:

&gt;1. Persons lawfully taking or holding wildlife pursuant to title 17 or pursuant to rules or orders of the Arizona game and fish commission.

&gt;2. Public employees or authorized agents acting within the scope of their authority for public safety or for wildlife management purposes.

But I would wear sunscreen everyday, just because your skin isn‚Äôt use to the sun and won‚Äôt be as tolerant of it. No need to go full on vampire in the sun an wear a large hat and cover all exposed skin, that would be overkill in January. We hover around 3-4 on the UV index this time of year, so not terrible but not nothing. If you don‚Äôt get a chance to grab some sunscreen before you get here just pop in to any CVS or Walgreens and grab something. Anything with a 30SPF or higher will be enough. 

As for what to do...depending on the dates you are here the Phoenix Open(https://wmphoenixopen.com/) is a fun outdoor event to enjoy at the end of January. Barrett Jackson (https://www.barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Schedule/Scottsdale-2020/d114c99a-0e71-46b2-8cde-20a53c127270) is another fun event in January if you‚Äôre into cars. Both are in Scottsdale and will be easy to get to using Uber (or public transport, but depending on where you stay may not be that easy). Both are a good way to experience the Phoenix/Scottsdale lifestyle. 

The botanical gardens are great and not to be missed. Also, there are mountains and great hiking available all around. Check Meet Up for some hiking groups when you are here to meet new people, and get a local perspective of our landscape. And as others have suggested the Old Town/Down Town Scottsdale area is a great place to wonder around and be a tourist for a bit. 

For a nice easy day trip head up to Cave Creek/Carefree for some kitschy old west charm and a sense of feeling like you‚Äôre getting out of the city (though it‚Äôs only about a 50 minute drive from Sky Harbor). For a good time (and an amusing travel anecdote) have dinner at the Horny Toad and dessert and drinks at the Satisfied Frog. üòâ

Around the backside of the Bell Rock  Courthouse Butte loop.

Park at Courthouse Vista, hike up the Bell Rock Pathway to the Courthouse Butte Loop, the follow it clockwise around to the east side of the Butte.

The west side of the loop (closer to the highway) gets a lot more people than the east side does.

Other hikes I would recommend are Doe Mountain (short and you get a 360 view from the top, but watch where you crest onto the mesa because it's easy to forget where the trail back down is), Boynton Canyon (longer but easy), and Fay Canyon.

Devil's Bridge is scenic but gets a ton of people.

841,841,massotravler,"Oatmen with the wild burros is cool, lake havasu with the London bridge if like history, lot of different hiking trails. Sedona ummm Tucson is not bad, Winslow Az.

Dm me for more detail I guess",1578419716,fdhc2uo
842,842,arcadianraven,"If you want to hit ghost towns and fun adventures in one day consider Jerome and Sedona in northern AZ. Close enough together that you could stay a few days in Sedona and make a day trip to Jerome! Jerome is an old mining town with some haunted spots, especially the hotel and Sedona is great for an outdoor adventure; hiking, mountain biking, jeep tours, etc. Downtown Sedona is also a busy tourist spot. Have fun!

EDIT: Both Jerome &amp; Sedona are about 1.5 hours north of Phx metro.",1578420081,fdhctgq
843,843,basicmitch0,Definitely check out Sedona and Jerome. They are right next to each other and are located along the way to Flagstaff.,1578420756,fdhe61e
844,844,linville619,"Still cold in January. Not Canada cold, but I suggest you head south to stay in Bisbee. It‚Äôs a crazy place. Just like Jerome. An artsy fartsy sort of ‚Äúhippies stay here‚Äù kind of place... only not as cold  as Jerome in January. It also has a haunted hotel. 

You will of course go through Tombstone which is worthwhile but only takes a matter of one or two hours to see everything there. I‚Äôm not a hiker but going south there are lots of opportunities. Particularly around Mt Lemon where you will of course find higher elevations and freeze your buns off.",1578421760,fdhfunz
845,845,AZPeakBagger,"Arizona is a huge state, so give yourself enough travel time to get to places.  

Plus, in Arizona it isn't how far north or south you are but how high in elevation you are.  Some places in Arizona have the potential to be as cold or colder than parts of Canada in January.  Right now I'm sitting in my home office with the windows open because it's 65 and sunny at 2500 feet in elevation.  But if I look out the window at the Catalina Mountains, the peaks are snow covered and the ski area is open at 9000 feet in elevation.  Both places are considered Tucson.  

Used to work at an outdoor &amp; hiking store and attempt to tell winter visitors they will need snow chains and long underwear to go see the Grand Canyon.  They'd look outside at the 70 degree weather and think I was nuts.",1578422388,fdhgw5a
846,846,zone8noob,"I am feeling homesick for AZ and lot this list together for you. The entire route would have 24 hours of driving, if weather is good. The northern areas can be quite snowy. 

The Canyon is best appreciated by hiking into it. It may be fogged in when you arrive. Sunrise and sunset are beautiful! Be wary of the hiking warnings - coming back up is the hardest way back I've ever experienced. (Return someday to hike Havasupai and or raft the Colorado river). 

1. Sedona (cold and snowy)

2. Grand Canyon (cold and fogged in? Maybe snow) (Flagstaff and route 66 are nearby with lots of tourist stops)

3. Crater Lake (lots of nearby lava tubes, cold and snowy)

4. Payson is a cute town to see offering a different way south

5. Tombstone and nearby Old Bisbee. (Freezing nights, warming days at 50-55).

Tombstone is more fun if you take time to enjoy some of the historical shows. Some of the shows are kinda bad, so be choosy. 

6. Kartchner Caverns - a cave where you can't touch anything, but it's a unique site that's worth a stop if you're into that sort of thing. 

Whatever you do, do NOT stop to see ""*The Thing*"" as advertised on I-10 billboards if you head down south.

847,847,AnotherFarker,"Below is my post from last year.  Long list of things to see/do, with links to information and more.  Split into 2 posts due to length.  I'll point out there are tons of unlisted subsets.  Tucson area has a ton of cool museums and stuff (and wine region), and every park around it has a ton of good hikes, mountain biking, et al.  Sedona -- they have a ton of good hikes/bikes/et al.  Flagstaff ...same.  Phoenix has a ton of good...traffic (Only slightly joking, but people miss that the parks in Phoenix have good hiking and mountain biking)  This list below are all just the ""destination"" stops to see.  I even left off roadside stuff, like the Phoenix/Tucson ostrich (and more) farm.

850,850,AnotherFarker,"Meh, I''ll repost/Rehost.  Here is a list of what you might want so you can build your own route.  Note prices, if given, were the last time I went. 

**Phoenix Area**
			
* [Tubing down the lower Salt Rive](https://www.google.com/search?q=salt+river+tubing)r.  Low cost.  One of the classic Arizona experience you simply sit in a tube and float down the river.  There‚Äôs desert on both sides and quite frequently, idiots all around you.  Typically you hold together (do not tie up together), brave the occasional small rapid, and try not to spill the cooler.  The trip includes all day bus pass (you usually only go down once) and tube.  It‚Äôs a very relaxing trip.  Bring Sunscreen, small cooler (they rent tubes with a bucket built in to put it in), sunscreen, big floppy hat, and old full sized sheets to tie around the tubes.  They get hot.
* [White Water Rafting](https://www.google.com/search?q=salt+river+canyon+rafting).  $70/person	Upper Salt River--no class 6 rapids, but a few class 4.  More rapids per mile than Grand Canyon and a much faster altitude drop.  Water runs pretty good in August.  I did it before and loved it, in a kayak.  Reservations needed.
* [Phoenix Butterfly Wonderland](https://www.google.com/search?q=Phoenix+Butterfly+Wonderland) (Loop 101 and Via de Ventura), 9500 E. Via de Ventura, Scottsdale; far North and East Phoenix.  Part of a complex that includes Pangaea Land of the Dinosaurs, OdySea Aquarium, and Dolphinaris Dolphin encounters.  Yes, the famous Arizona Sand Dolphins in their natural habitat.
* Phoenix Mountain Hikes.  The two classics.  [Camelback mountain](https://www.google.com/search?q=hike+camelback+mountain) (you can park in Echo Canyon to hike up the west side if you get there early, or on the east side), and [Squaw/Piastawa Peak](https://www.google.com/search?q=hike+piestewa+peak).

**Central AZ I-17 between Phoenix and Flagstaff.**

See Tuzigoot, Montezuma's Castle, then Montezuma's Well as you travel I-17 from South to North  Then Wet Beaver Creek.   ([google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/Ato295daDq72) so you can see why).  Or reverse it if going North to South.

* Black Canyon Food Stop Breakfast at the restaurant in Black Canyon City.  Nice place.
* [Tuzigoot National Monument](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tuzigoot+National+Monument) -- Free. Pre-Columbian ruin from approx. 1300 AD. 25 Tuzigoot Rd, Clarkdale, AZ.   W. across I-17 from Montezuma monuments, between Jerome and Cottonwood.
* [Montezuma's Castle](https://www.google.com/search?q=Montezuma's+Castle) - Free.  Ruins of Sinagua Indian cliff dwellings.  2800 N Montezuma Castle Hwy, Camp Verde, AZ 86322
* [Montezuma Well National Monument](https://www.google.com/search?q=Montezuma+Well+National+Monument) --  Free.  Collapsed volcano turned into an underground spring-fed pool which is encircled by Indian ruins.  A unique ecosystem in the world.  You can hike down and see where the water exits, then walk outside the rim and see where Indians built an aqueduct.  5508 Beaver Creek Rd, Lake Montezuma, AZ 86335
* [Wet Beaver Creek](https://www.google.com/search?q=Wet+Beaver+Creek) Hike along a running river.  A chance to see how quickly the wet water and shady maple and oak trees give way to rocky desert with cholla and saguaro cactus.  Just west of Montazuma's Well.
* [Tonto Natural Bridge](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tonto+Natural+Bridge).  State Park.  Low cost or free with State park pass.  A huge natural bridge in an Arizona state park.  You can look down at it (quick) or hike down and walk inside it.  East of Camp Verde on I-17, 10 miles W of Payson.  Believed to be the largest natural travertine bridge in the world.   GPS: 34.3226, -111.4485
* **Sedona/Oak Creek Canyon/Jerome/Prescott** -- If you drive one way and see Montezuma's stops, the recommended alternate route is to detour off I-17 and back via 89. Try to do it M-F when traffic is lighter, and via the [Red Rock Scenic Byway](https://www.google.com/search?q=red+rock+scenic+byway).  While a favorite stop in the summer is [Slide Rock State Park](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+rock+az) (sometimes closed), Red Rock State Park, or Crescent Moon Picnic Site, there are also [Jeep Tours](https://www.google.com/search?q=sedona+jeep+tours) that take you 4x4ing into the desert with experienced and fun guides.  Many people like the short hike for [Devil's Bridge](https://www.google.com/search?q=sedona+devil%27s+bridge), but there are tons of other hikes in the area such as Cathedral Rock, Doe Mountain Trail, Boynton Canyon Trail, Thumb Butte, [Chicken Point](https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/road-trips/2016/01/05/sedona-best-scenic-views/78278710/)(by the popular Broken Arrow Trail)and some drive up spots like Bell Rock and Chapel of the Holy Cross.  If you have the ability, then [Schnebly Hill Road](https://www.google.com/search?q=Schnebly+hill+road) is a great 4x4 drive, most jeep tours cover it.
* Getting closer to Flagstaff:  [Arcosanti village](https://www.google.com/search?q=Arcosanti) if you have an interest.  Arcosanti is an experimental micro-city seeking the radical reorganization of the built environment by integrating Architecture and Ecologogy
* [Camp Verde/Cotton Steam Train Ride](https://www.google.com/search?q=Verde+Steam+Train+Ride).  A steam train ride thru the Mogillian Rim area.

**Northern AZ**

* [Petrified National Forest](https://www.google.com/search?q=Petrified+National+Forest).  Petrified forest and painted desert.  You can do a 2 hour drive-thru, but get out and hike through the hills and sit on the petrified logs.  Hikes are under a mile.  Bring water and sunscreen  in the summer.  Depending on your next destination, there are entrances on the South side (618 Petrified Forest Road Holbrook, AZ 86025) and you can head up North to Canyon de Chelly, or enter on the North (off I-40, 35.0614, -109.7828) and head down Hwy 190 and camp in Apache National Forest (beautiful drive).
* [Window Rock](https://www.google.com/search?q=window+rock+arizona) - If you're between the Petrified National Forest and Canyon de Chelly, swing on by.  The town of Window Rock has Window Rock, a self-guided tour of Veteran's Memorial, the only American Indian zoo, a Navajo Museum, and a few other features to see in the area.
* [Canyon de Chelly](https://www.google.com/search?q=Canyon+de+Chelly) - Canyon de Chelly depends on how much time you want to spend exploring.  The scenic drives on the top are about 2 hours each, but you can also take a lot of short hikes.  Plan which side you visit so the sun is behind you.  There's a decent campsite with flush toilets nearby, lots of mosquitoes.  You can get a guided tour inside the canyon (Hiking, Horseback, or driven); contact the NPS for the current list and pricing ‚Äìit's about $100 to go inside.
* [Navajo National Monument](https://www.google.com/search?q=navajo+national+monument+arizona) -  NE AZ, on the way to 4 Corners.  This is a great stop.   Has two campgrounds; one with full service flush toilets, and one with very clean vault toilets.  First come, first served, never seen it full.  Offers guided hikes into the ruins in the morning that few people go on.
* Four Corners.  Worth seeing once.  Hot in the summer, usually a little wait to take a picture alone.  Area is surrounded by Indian vendors, don't take a picture without asking.  Navajo web page is often down.
* [Grand Falls](https://www.google.com/search?q=Grand+Falls) - On the Indian Reservation; you're supposed to pay, but no one I met knew where to pay the Indians.  At 185 feet tall it's taller than Niagara Falls. It dumps snow melt or monsoon rain into the Little Colorado River below and is famous for its brown water.  Dirt roads to get there, mostly graded.  Best during spring wet season.
* [Wupatki National Monument](https://www.google.com/search?q=Wupatki+National+Monument) - National Park, a well preserved Native American settlement site.  About 3 stops on the way in with short hikes, the main compound, and 2 short hikes on the way out.   After visiting the park, you can exit via  Sunset National Crater.
* [Williams AZ Steam Train](https://www.google.com/search?q=Grand+Canyon+Railway)  - Steam train ride to the Grand Canyon (aka Grand Canyon Railway, in Williams AZ)
* [Lava River Tube / Ice cave](https://www.google.com/search?q=arizona+lava+tube) ‚Äì W. of Flagstaff, then up a well graded forest service road.  A  3/4 mile long underground Lava Tube.  Entry road starts just across the highway from Camp Navajo (about 30 min west of Flagstaff ).  You walk on solidified magma.  It's also a good area for a picnic after exploring the tube.  There's supposed to be another tube in the area that's not as interesting.  Bring multiple light sources and warm clothes‚Äîit's cold inside even in the middle of summer.

**A single Northern AZ tour plotted out:**

Tucson to Northern AZ Tour:  https://goo.gl/maps/LNWFuboCjT12
Tucson ‚Äì Canyon de Chelle (low cost campsite right outside; see above) ‚Äì Four Corners ‚Äì Navajo National Monument (Camp/Ruins in AM) -- Wupatki Natl Monument ‚Äì Sunset Crater ‚Äì Grand Falls (dirt road) ‚Äì Camp Navajo (Tent or RV camp during open season for military/retired) ‚Äì Lava tube (well graded forest road) ‚Äì Tucson.  Google Maps reduced the number of route points to 9.  We hit both sides of Canyon de Chelly, for example, but I couldn't show it because I hit the max # of routing points.",1578424376,fdhk6f5
851,851,AnotherFarker,"**Around the Grand Canyon**

* Grand Canyon.  Pretty much it.  If you see more than one national park this year, get a parks pass.  If you do visit northern AZ/Southern Utah, stop and see [Vermilion Cliffs National Munument](https://www.google.com/search?q=vermilion+cliffs).  It is home to the very famous ""[The Wave](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paria+Canyon+the+wave)"" (permit required), Paria Canyon that has many more cool spots than The Wave, Buckskin Gulch, and Coyote Buttes.  Loos like Mars in some places.
* Hike to [Cape Solitude](https://www.google.com/search?q=cape+solitude+grand+canyon).   Depending on route you can hike, mountain bike, or dive in via 4wd.  
* [Havasupai Falls](https://www.google.com/search?q=Havasupai+Falls) (West GC).  Need to book far in advance ‚Äì it's too late now, unless someone taps out and there's a last minute opening.
* Horseshoe Bend (West GC) ‚Äì A stop for pictures.  See it now, before the parking lot/viewing ramp [destroys it with a crush of crowds](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/8gqvvv/one_of_my_favorite_places_in_arizona_to_watch_a/).
* [Antelope Canyon](https://www.google.com/search?q=Antelope+Canyon) / [Canyon X](https://www.google.com/search?q=antelope+canyon+x) / [Cathedral Canyon](https://www.google.com/search?q=Cathedral+canyon) Etc.  Staged photos look great; reality is it's more crowded and they push you on.
* [Grand Canyon Glass Skywalk](https://www.google.com/search?q=grand+canyon+glass+skywalk) on Indian rez ‚Äì NOT recommended.  Walk 100 feet over Grand Canyon on glass bridge.  Normal tour doesn't include skywalk.  To see total fee, click legacy gold for skywalk package.  [Yelp reviews are harsh](http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-canyon-skywalk-grand-canyon-west); not worth the cost, can't take pictures (but they'll sell them to you), and they rush you off.  Another view (http://youtu.be/BvzlZuWrJNw?t=35s ):   Looks majestic at 35 seconds, then you get to the 1 min mark and see the main canyon is off on the side, and you're just over a small drop-off.


**So we'll throw away these for being too far south (Tucson) but leave in for others:**

* Between Tucson and Phoenix:  [Ostrich ranch](https://www.google.com/search?q=rooster+cogburn+ostrich+ranch)/4 wheel adventure/petting zoo.  Cheap fun.

Big trucks take the rocks to the plant, and you can watch every step of the way as they go from truck, to big rocks, to little rocks, to slurry, to copper slurry.  1421 W. Pima Road, Sahuarita.  
* San Xavier Mission  http://www.sanxaviermission.org/History.html  Not really that interesting to me.  Others love it.

There‚Äôs actually a lot of hiking and stuff to do around Phoenix if you are looking to stay close.  Camelback Mountain is in Scottsdale, there are many state parks around (we love Lost Dutchman SP, which is just down the road from a couple of ghost towns, Tortilla Flat and Gold Field.  Disclaimer: we have never been to the ghost towns so I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre like).  The Desert Botanical Garden is beautiful, but pricey!

If you head north, Prescott is a very cute town with hiking around.  Sedona is obviously a fan favorite, but it may be cold in January (not Canada cold though!).  Flagstaff is beautiful but gets cold and snowy.  Sunset Crater National Monument is an especially neat place in Flagstaff to me.  I‚Äôve heard wonderful things about Jerome, but haven‚Äôt been myself.

Goldfield Ghost Town, its less than an hour outside of Phoenix, its a recreated frontier town complete with a saloon where you can have a burger and a beer, fudge shop, reptile zoo, underground mine tour, train ride tour, and zip line. Its also right across the highway from Lost Dutchman State Park which has some amazing and fairly easy hikes for great views. (Look up Flatiron Mountain hikes). Goldfield has no admission charge, Lost Dutchman you have to pay for a state park day use, or you can camp. For day use its $7, camping is $25 if you have a tent, $89 for a cabin rental. 

While here definitely see the Grand Canyon. Also sites you can't see anywhere else- Biosphere 2, about 2 hours from Phoenix. The tour lasts about an hour and is extremely educational. From there you can go south to Pima Air &amp; Space Museum in South. Tucson, check to see if you can get a tour of the Boneyard: a huge holding facility for nearly a hundred years of military planes. Admission there will also get you into Titan Missile Museum which is about an hour south. Its a Cold War Era Titan 2 underground missile silo. Then on your way back stop at San Xavier Mission.

&gt;Outside of Phoenix, in the scorching Arizona desert, sits a farm that Saudi Arabia's largest dairy uses to make hay for cows back home.  
&gt;  
&gt;That dairy company, named Almarai, bought the farm last year and has planted thousands of acres of groundwater-guzzling alfalfa to make that hay. Saudi Arabia can't grow its own hay anymore because those crops drained its own ancient aquifer.

Well I guess they are draining our water supplies now.

I wonder when hemp will finally be more accepted, it is much better for feed than alfalfa, less methane emissions, half the water to grow it and the cows are actually [healthier](https://www.drovers.com/article/facts-and-fiction-about-hemp-animal-feed) from it.

Steve Farley who ran for governor last year (he could have won over Ducey if he won the primary) [had some great plans](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/lindavaldez/2018/07/31/arizona-governor-race-candidates-steve-farley-democrat-mainstream/868681002/) to push this idea of [hemp farming over alfalfa and cotton to save water](https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/radio/is-the-hemp-boom-changing-water-use-in-colorado-agriculture/).  If [farmers in Arizona switched to hemp over alfalfa and cotton](https://arizonawet.arizona.edu/content/could-farming-hemp-save-water), we could [save about 50% of the water](https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/publications-and-radio/radio/is-the-hemp-boom-changing-water-use-in-colorado-agriculture/) needed.

About 6 miles out from Tortilla Flat the road goes from asphalt to bumpy, dusty dirt and climbs up about 9 miles to Fish Creek Hill (has since washed away and won't allow travel for 3 years so I'm told) hold on to your steering wheel as you move down the barely passable road. God damn I so love this road. It is a post card every foot you travel. Awesome doesn't do justice or an apt description of where you are surrounded by. Giant saugauro, big horn sheep, eagles and pristine desert. So fucking beautiful.

1292,1292,Ill_Advance,"I second this, CBD might be a better option to try first for anxiety. Both these from pubmed agree CBD is useful for anxiety. I'd say you might consider starting with with 25mg as needed. Stretch out the time between doses as much as you can, trying it once in the morning might be a good place to start. You might consider increasing if thats what you determine. Its possible to increase the dose and lengthen the interval based on what you have.  You might consider vaping or under the tongue. Both are good, vaping might be a little quicker. It might not be the best idea to consume large amounts of alcohol or Tylenol if you are taking large amounts of CBD. If you have lung problems such as asthma you might want to opt for under the tongue administration. CBD might also make you a little tired. YMMV, be safe.

[proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8vu8e0/so_this_came_through_my_work_yesterday/)


A little bit of background, the lady who sold us this record has been coming in to the store and selling us some pretty legit Star Wars merchandise, one of them a bunch of stickers when it was originally going to be called *The* Star Wars. When I asked her how she got her hands on this particular record, she didn't get in to specifics but said she was close to one of the producers on the movie, and promised it was legit. 

It was sitting in the back of the store for a year and a half, mostly because we didn't have an effective way to display it. Once a solution was figured out, our store manager made a post on the Star Wars subreddit, pretty similar to mine from a year and a half ago, and it made enough traction to get Mark Hamill's attention. We were able to get in touch with him when he confirmed it was his so we sent the record back. We got some cool signed goodies in return!",1578770829,fdxn2tm

In the Grand Canyon area, temps will probably be in the 75-80 range, but nighttime temps in the higher elevations could drop into the 50‚Äôs/even 40‚Äôs that time of year.  It looks like you have a great itinerary planned out so far. If you have time, definitely squeeze in a side trip to Sedona/Oak Creek on your way to/from the Grand Canyon. Beautiful scenery and plenty of opportunities for pics/videos of the area. Also - if you‚Äôre doing Antelope Canyon, you‚Äôre close enough to Lake Powell to take an hour or two to find a scenic vantage point and get some great photos of the lake. üëçüèª",1578779483,fdyg75h

I think you have a solid itinerary as it is. You're not trying to cram too much in to each day. A lot of people underestimate how big Arizona is. Don't try to drive back from Page to catch a same day flight unless your flight is in the evening. That's a long drive.

You might catch some thunderstorms. The monsoon typically lasts from early July through mid September, but it's usually tapering off by September. Don't hike in the slot canyons (including Antelope Canyon) around Page if there are thunderstorms anywhere remotely close.

1472,1472,JMP817,"But there really isn't any place in Old Bisbee to do that. If you haven't been there, it is hard to understand. Basically, the town is built inside a canyon and the homes are perched on the cliff walls in some places. Your front steps to a home in Old Bisbee may be a flight of 60 or so steps. The roads there were built prior to the car and were intended to be walked or at the most done on horseback. As such, there is basically a loop of streets where once you miss a turn, you get to do the Grand Tour of town in order to come back and try it again a few minutes later. 

I think they've done a pretty good job with what they have. To do a parking garage would only make sense if it was done with a shuttle service and the demand isn't enough to justify it. Honestly, if Bisbee were to get that busy, I don't think it would be as charming.",1578935209,fe983k1

Tell people living in homes their family has owned for 100+ years that they now can't park or drive up to their homes, but it is OK there is a new parking garage blasted into the mountain over there and an electric trolley (likely paid for by their tax dollars) will happily move them back and forth.

Tombstone is fun and might as well hit up Bisbee for mining/ghost town fix. Cool eclectic little city there.

You don't need two days in Petrified. I spent half a day there and went to almost every listed spot on their brochure. I would spend more time in Sedona or hit up Jerome (another mining ghost town).

Tucson to Sedona is a 4-hour Drive through PHX, and Flag is kind of between Petrified Forest and Sedona, but you can add interest going through Payson up and Flag/Sedona down.

Maybe do an East AZ circuit: PHX -I10-&gt; TUC --77/60--&gt; Petrified/Painted -I40-&gt; FLG --89A--&gt; Sedona -I17--&gt;PHX

And I second less time at petrified forest ... it's largely drive-through with a handful of short ""hikes""

Prescott has some cool nuggets of Cowboy culture and decent hiking too ...

Or leave off Tucson altogether and focus on the forests and canyons to the north. Do Southern Arizona separate. Or based on your interest, *focus* on southern AZ, Bisbee, Tombstone, maybe Organ Pipe ... but Petrified Forest/Painted Desert and Sedona are both awe-inspiring.

I tend to do more rugged backpacking, canyoneering, etc.  But some people love the more popular stuff like Piestewa or Camelback.  So that said, and not knowing what you're looking for exactly, here are some things you can look into;

\- Petrified Forest - Blue Mesa was a highlight.  There is an old, unmaintained trail off the blue mesa trail that has some incredible ridgeline walks.

\- Canyon de Chelly - Hike to Whitehouse ruins, stay at a hogan at Spider Rock campground.  Crazy amount of ruins and cool history in this spot.

\- Coal Mine canyon (quick stop off at the camp/overlook)

\- Blue Canyon - Hopi guide required

\- Superstitions - Peralta trail to the saddle, Flatiron/Hill 5024 for a challenge, Boulder Canyon for views

\- Sedona - Wilson Mountain, Hangover trail and, of course, West Fork/Oak Creek

\- Fossil Creek by Camp Verde (permits required sometimes).  Bonus adventure points if you do West Clear Creek (advanced area, 4WD high clearance needed in most spots)

\- Colossal Cave in Vail, AZ - Take the Ladder Tour for more adventure.  (Right by Saguaro NP)

\- Check out Cochise Stronghold/Tombstone/Chiricauas Heart of Rocks trail.

The renovation in terminal 3 has certainly changed the atmosphere there. Terminal 4 is in need of a refresh -- the carpet is definitely getting threadbare -- but it's not too bad, not compared to many of the airports I visit.

I've really not had a problem with lines being too long at Sky Harbor. In fact, compared to most I'd say they're pretty damn approachable. I've never had a line at a restroom. I can't really comment on coffee shops or gift stores as I don't patronize those.

1995,1995,Level9TraumaCenter,"&gt;It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on Earth has ever produced the expression ""as pretty as an airport"". Airports are ugly. Some are very ugly. Some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort. This ugliness arises because airports are full of people who are tired, cross, and have just discovered that their luggage has landed in Murmansk (...) and the architects have on the whole tried to reflect this in their designs.

&gt;They have sought to highlight the tiredness and crossness motif with brutal shapes and nerve jangling colours, to make effortless the business of separating the traveller from his or her luggage or loved ones, to confuse the traveller with arrows that appear to point at the windows, distant tie racks, or the current position of the Ursa Minor in the night sky, and wherever possible to expose the plumbing on the grounds that it is functional, and conceal the location of the departure gates, presumably on the grounds that they are not.

2005,2005,Vast-Design,"Not too cost effective, but they give reduced rates for second and third dog so that‚Äôs nice. 
Scottsdale doggie suites is AMAZING. There‚Äôs something like 12 hours a day of play time where the dog friendly dogs play together in a large area, the employees are absolute pros- they can manage to get the room settled down for nap time so easily and then all the dogs take a communal nap time. They take them on walks, and they have a staff member ACTIVELY there 24/7, the night staff stays up, cuddles with dad dogs, checks on everyone, etc. 
Because of the play time, they do require a comped 2 hour ‚Äútest‚Äù before the first actual stay, this is so they can see how they interact with others and if they‚Äôll be a fit. 
They also accommodate dogs who do not join the playtime- I had a dog who didn‚Äôt get along with most others, she got along with my dads dog so they put them in a separate play time together, and then let my dads join the large group for a bit. She had separation anxiety so they cuddled her. 

They send daily pictures of your fur babies, usually during playtime. 
They can accommodate meds. 
They have special kennels, all are larger than other kennels I‚Äôve seen but they have full rooms too, including a room with a couch and TV. 
They give feeding cards at the end so you can see how much and when your dog ate(some don‚Äôt eat the first day or so, but they try adding broth, wet food, gravy, etc if they won‚Äôt eat, all dog safe)
They accommodate allergies and special needs, including round the clock meds. 

One requirement they have for the stay is that their meals be separately packaged. So say they eat 2x a day, with 3 dogs that means 6 bags/day portioned. 
This is because they have so many dogs and they don‚Äôt want to get mixed up and take so long with measuring- it‚Äôs easy to dump a bag in a bowl. If they eat different amounts, label the bags, or bring their foods in shopping bags and have the big bag labeled with name. 
If you give any dental treats(my dad gives 2 dentasticks a day to his big boi) I‚Äôd recommend throwing them into the meal bags, just to make things easier.",1579468421,ff0flsz

There is a partially built hospital that has been abandoned and it is an eyesore, probably legal proceedings going on to rip it down. Lots of hiking. Some big churches. Very clean.

2080,2080,roussell131,"A few reasons. One is that I live in New York City, where entirely too many stories are set already. Another is that I've already written other projects set there, as well as most other cities I've lived in or spent a lot of time in. Another is that I'm writing about a cast of five characters who need to be spread throughout the country in order to be representative of it, and I don't want to set them all in giant, well-known urban areas.   


But apart from all that, I find the process of getting to know a place and settling my character there really engaging and helpful to the rest of the project. I understand that the maxim of ""write what you know"" is very popular, but it has its limits, especially when you've been doing it a long time. At the risk of sounding like an ass, I've done this enough times to not be clumsy about it. My research isn't quick and dirty; I'm using these replies to supplement a lot of other methods, from Google Street View to governmental websites to Yelp. I'm also careful to make the references infrequent and unobtrusive and not overly specific so they don't stick out like a sore thumb‚Äîafter all, actual residents don't constantly and explicitly refer to where they live. Everything I'm looking up will ultimately result in only a handful of lines, just enough to keep Peoria from feeling like a generic, faceless place to the reader.

2106,2106,wayler72,"So first off I just want to apologize for not really answering your question. The answer I can give is based on living for the past 25 years in various parts of the greater Phoenix area, although never in the Peoria area. I am sure someone who has lived specifically in the Peoria area for decades could give a more nuanced response in terms of neighborhood characteristics and qualities.

With the understanding that practically speaking Peoria is just another part of the greater Phoenix area, I don't really see it as having the characteristics your looking for. By and large if you want to know the ins and outs of living in Peoria it's really not going to be all that different from Phoenix. There are some areas I would consider to have a stronger identity - Scottsdale as a wealthier area and Tempe as the college town but at the end of the day they're all just slightly different aspects of living in the greater Phoenix area.

Without knowing more context of what you're writing, I would look at some place like Prescott or Payson for areas that are smaller and further away from Phoenix and therefore more likely to have their own identity separate from Phoenix. Flagstaff (northern college town) would also be be better as a bigger town/city than Prescott/Payson or Cave Creek/Carefree as an area near Phoenix but has an identity more of it's own than a place like Peoria. You could also look to smaller places that have histories of being old mining towns like Jerome.

My perspective may be a little limited but again, to me Peoria is just another aspect of Phoenix and not an area that I consider all that distinct. If you can give an idea of the character you have in mind, it may be easier to match them to a place in Arizona that shares those qualities.",1579538624,ff3cw1w

To this day, the old Capitol building has one elevator and two elevator shafts. If a second elevator has been outside the scope of the budget, then it is safe to say that glass spires are, too.",1579538864,ff3ddpk
2109,2109,SacredUrchin,"Job market: In terms of jobs market, I can‚Äôt speak for Flagstaff or other areas of Arizona, but Phoenix has a very healthy job market. Even without a job lined up, with your background I‚Äôm sure it wouldn‚Äôt take long to find something just to get you some income flowing and find a place to live (assuming you interview well, etc.).  As for the specific type of job you‚Äôre looking for, I can‚Äôt say. 

Job searching: I have always used Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster.com, for my job searches. But I‚Äôm sure others might have other suggestions. 

Commuting: it all depends on where your job is. Tempe, Scottsdale, Phoenix will be the most central areas closer to most jobs but it‚Äôs hard to say. One thing to consider is living east and commuting westbound to your job in the mornings will save you from having the sun in your face on both your commutes. 

Traffic: it‚Äôs all relative to where you‚Äôre from and it depends the time of day. Traffic outside of rush hour is usually very good. Phoenix is a well built and organized city with room for population growth. Morning rush hour traffic usually starts at around 6am - 8:30pm and afternoon rush hour is between around 3:00pm to 6:30pm (depending on what side of town and what direction you drive you may not be affected by rush hour traffic at all).  Rush hour traffic tends to flow toward city center in mornings and opposite in afternoon. So if you‚Äôre traveling from city center outward in mornings chances are you won‚Äôt hit a lot of traffic. 
Traffic in Phoenix is relative to where you‚Äôre from. If you‚Äôre from L.A., Chicago, Seattle, or other cities with horrible gridlock, then Phoenix‚Äôs worst traffic probably won‚Äôt phase you. I know a lot of people complain about traffic in Phoenix but compared to other cities with similar populations, Phoenix is not that bad at all. Of course if you‚Äôre commuting from a far distance in rush hour traffic, expect to be sitting in it for an hour or more. 

As for your car - to the best of my knowledge, Arizona only requires emissions testing and I don‚Äôt believe rust is a thing they check for here. In the emissions tests I‚Äôve had done I have never noticed them look for signs of rust. 

As a note of encouragement, I moved to AZ from a colder, rainier climate and have not regretted my decision. Whether you choose to live in Tucson, Phoenix, or Flagstaff, each city has its own awesome personality. One advantage I can think of for living in Phoenix, if you‚Äôre willing to tolerate the summer heat, is its location. Being central makes it easy to navigate all over Arizona. If you like skiing, trees, and snow, Flagstaff is only a couple hours drive. If you wanna go to Mexico, Rocky Point is a 3.5 hr drive. Vegas, L.A., San Diego are all about a 5.5 hr. drive. 
Once you‚Äôre here and settled I can give you suggestions for a whole bunch of cool things to do in these here parts.

For the career you're looking for, you won't find it in Flagstaff unfortunately. It's a college town that's 2 hours north of a sprawling metropolis full of world headquarters and corporate centers. There are very few actual professional jobs in Flag outside of those dealing with the University firsthand. This is compounded by the fact that the people who are lucky enough to get those jobs seem to stay in Flag for decades.

The weather there is gorgeous. It is fairly cold during winter, typically hovering around 32¬∞F on sunny days and dropping below 10¬∞ at night. They always get a few strong blizzards each year that can drop up to 3 feet of snow, 4 on rare occasions. The thing about the snow, though, is that it doesn't stick around a long like I'm sure you're used to in MI. Being at such a low latitude, the snow in town melts off surprisingly fast. This leads, though, to lots of puddles, mud, and muck. IMHO, still better than the frozen tundra of the Lakes states.

Springtime weather is hit or miss. It can be mid-50's in March and then snow in May. It's kind of a running joke at NAU that it always snows on graduation day in early May. Once May has set in though, holy fuck, dude; that weather is phenomenal. Cool and crisp mornings and evenings, a beautiful 80¬∞ in June, and the perpetual smell of wet pine and crystal-clean mountain air. Summer monsoon starts up in July and you can set your watch by the afternoon thunderstorms that blow through. Absolutely perfect and refreshing.

Outside of weather, though, there isn't a lot of draw for people to stay in Flag long-term. The city's population fluctuates wildly with students coming and going as well as tourists and big University events, like graduation. The city has poor road infrastructure that simply is not designed for the growth they've seen over the past 20 years. Flagstaff's ""rush hour"", if you can believe it, is ridiculous. It can take you 20 minutes to go 2 miles, and you'll wonder why you didn't walk in the first place. There are essentially two main roads through town and a lot of traffic bottlenecks with lots of buses, cyclists, and pedestrians.

Full disclosure: It's an intensely progressive city - not necessarily a negative, but even for a left-leaning person like me, it takes an adjustment period. If you're around campus (chances are you will be), get used to ironic mustaches, wireless vinyl players, flannel button-ups, and artesinal hemp oils. Of course, if you're a little more cowboy than that, the northern/eastern edges of town may be more appealing.

Bottom line: If you're looking for some small-town charm with essentially the same amenities of a big city, it's worth a look. If you really want a total night-and-day experience with the weather, Phoenix is obviously the choice. Of course, finding a career you want may well take priority over that, and then Phoenix is likely your only option.

2248,2248,whotookthenamezandl,"For local food, I highly recommend Carolina's Mexican Food. Real, authentic, homemade with love; an institution. Also Chino Bandido. Any real Phoenician will attest to the Bandido. Paradise Valley Burger Company on 40th and Bell is a really neat place. Small, casual, not on a lot of people's radars, kinda quirky, but it's a killer craft burger. It makes 5 Guys and SmashBurger taste like slop.

For breakfast, hit up a Filiberto's one morning and let a breakfast burrito take care of your problems. Any of them will do, but the machaca burrito is my go-to.

As for where to stay for cheaper rates, I'd look to the west of the Open for a bnb. Not too far west, just maybe somewhere in the 85050, 85024, or 85054 zip codes. 85028 and 85254 are solid, too. A lot of people are probably booking in Scottsdale near Old Town and out in the Frank Lloyd Wright areas.

Most sports bars around town have pretty good food, honestly. Not a lot of dives left anymore, at least in the northeast valley around the Open. Just follow the Google reviews. You can expect between $11-$16 for a big meal with $4-$5 domestics and $6-$9 craft pints. Desert Ridge (on Tatum and the 101 freeway) has a ton of neat dining options, all of which are at least good, but it may be fairly crowded. A case of your favorite pisswater will go for about $22 at the grocery store, which will be the cheapest *and* they'll be cold. A twelve-pack of cerveza (Dos, Corona, Modelo) will be anywhere from $11 to $15 at the store, but I'd guess it'll be a little cheaper on sale for the big weekend. As for a store, I recommend Fry's. I shop them all to be honest, but Fry's has the most consistently low prices on beer. They also have loose cans and bottles of craft and hard-to-find stuff and you can make a six pack of whatever for like $9. (Just remember to ask to get a shopper's card for the sale prices; it's free.)

Gas has been right around $2.90 or $3/gallon for quite some time now. Cheapest places are usually grocery store gas stations (Fry's, Safeway) and Circle K. Chevron and Shell are regularly greater than 20¬¢ more expensive per gallon. Not sure what places you've got up there.

Finally, for golf, all the places anywhere close to the Open are going to be booked by now and expensive as hell. I really, really recommend Rolling Hills. It's not terribly close to the Open, but that may be to your advantage. It's got iconic desert scenery, a full 18 holes, and the 3rd fairway backs right up to the zoo and you can hear the big cats roaring and prowling around on a good day. Get out in the morning and you'll see coyotes and rabbits and all kinds of birds all over. Check it out: https://maps.app.goo.gl/2WjHqmoGXMNGATgE6

2277,2277,AZPeakBagger,"Used to teach hiking classes at a local outdoors store, both a beginners and an advanced level hiking course.  Doing my research I spoke with a few local ER nurses and doctors about snake bites in Arizona.  Most snake bites in Arizona DO NOT come from hiking.  The average snake bite victim in Arizona tends to be a male aged 18-30 and alcohol is involved and the bite is on the lower arm.  So think ""hold my beer and watch this"".  

The other snake bites I've read about or heard about tend to be in people's yards.  Reach under a bush to clean out a flower bed and get nailed.  Or you open up the control box for your irrigation system and find a snake sleeping in there who gets mad.  

When I lived in the Phoenix area it took me almost 20 years of hiking and trail running on urban trails before I actually found my first rattlesnake and I was actively searching for them.  They don't like people.  Each of the small mountain ranges in the Phoenix area has a different species of rattlesnake.  The ones around South Mountain are very mellow, typically grey speckled and blend in very well.  The snakes around North Mountain/Shaw Butte and central Phoenix are a tad more aggressive and are a very pretty pink color.  But they will leave you alone generally.  The only place I encounter nasty, aggressive snakes around Phoenix is north from Cave Creek out to Lake Pleasant.  Those snakes will curl up and rattle if you get within 10 yards of them while cursing you and your family and waving a switch blade around.  

That being said, I've stepped on them, accidentally urinated on one while off in the bushes on a nature break and now that I live in very snake infested Tucson see them at least 2-3 times a month.  Just give them space and they will leave you alone.  Snakes will only rattle if they feel threatened.  Maybe 5-10% of my snake encounters will they rattle.",1579611971,ff5vts5

2302,2302,Banjo_bit_me,Nice shot. It's amazing country - have always wondered if you flipped a switch and went back 200 years (before livestock were introduced) would it be this eroded or would it be rolling grassland or something in between. Our western heritage was [built partially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Land_%26_Cattle_Company) on the introduction of cattle and sheep who by necessity graze on whatever they can... When we have friends and family visiting we often treat them to the scenery of Northern Arizona.,1579621213,ff67v7a

Here is the weird part, while you are reading through the material, there will be random facts thrown in. In my case, they were about ASU mascot, Sparky. So I'm reading about what lanes are allowed to turn into which and right in the middle is 'Did you know Sparky's favorite food is Jack in the Box?' and shit like that and your final quiz is not at all based on traffic shit but entirely based on those Sparky facts. I think they do this so you don't just go to the page and let the timer tick. You actually have to read this shit since the questions you need to answer are mixed in.",1579622290,ff69iww

I was told it might be wise to replace all four if they find a problem with one.  

Funny thing:  I read there's a way to disconnect the tire pressure monitor receiver from the check engine light.  There's a diagram and removing the radio, behind it is a box with some wires.  I like having good sensors though.  Worth the money.  Saves on tire problems and cost.

2414,2414,antisyncline,"Take this with a grain of salt, because I no longer live in AZ , but I moved  to Tempe then to South Scottsdale (and then to Midtown and Downtown....) soon after college (I was 24ish) and it took me a little bit to get used to it, but here's what I found.

&amp;#x200B;

Tempe is alright, but I was already tired of the college scene, so Scottsdale was a better fit for me because it was close to Tempe if I wanted to go out there, there are still pretty young bars in S. Scottsdale, but the neighborhoods were generally pretty quiet and peaceful. It seemed to me that South Scottsdale was recent grads, also retirees and snowbirds, but that when going out, the demographic was more like 25-30. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, depending on where in Scottsdale you live, it's a really quick drive/ride to Tempe (even though it seems far away.... I liked being close to the 101, because once you are on the highway -- and it's not rush hour-- it was really fast to get anywhere, even if when you look at the mileage, it seems like it would be far in most city layouts). There is also a convenient bike path/green way running through Scottsdale to Tempe. Even in Tempe, things will probably still feel a bit suburb-ey, just because the cities are so spread out,

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I initially moved to Phoenix, I was not prepared for how everything was going to be in a stripmall... it took me a little bit to figure it out, but the stripmalls in Arizona aren't like the stripmalls I'm used to. in AZ, there are a lot of pretty nondescript places that you wouldn't expect to see in a stripmall next to a dollar store, but hey, that's where the brewery was able to get a lease (in the same stripmall was a night club, Caribbean buffet, a yoga studio, and english pub).  Use Yelp liberally to find places as well, good places are out there, but they can blend in.

&amp;#x200B;

The bars that I would recommend in S. Scottsdale, if you are looking for a younger crowd would be Gilligans and Pattie's.  These are also close enough to a bunch of clubs on Drinkwater (not my scene, but I could have a good time), if that interest you.

&amp;#x200B;

One nice thing about phoenix that I found was that a lot of people there are transplants, they are also not looking to settle down generally (my theory is that people take jobs there out of college, but aren't looking to live in Phoenix forever), and the nice weather means people are able to go out all-year -- and this lends itself to people/strangers being very social, and having that be a norm rather than an exception. Another way to meet people is through [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com), it's been a few years, but while I was there the Meetup communities in Phoenix seemed generally more active than the ones where I live now, because everyone is trying to figure out how to meet new people there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry to hear you are depressed and homesick -- and I can definitely relate to that feeling whenever I moved somewhere new. But I would recommend sticking out Central Scottsdale until learning the city a bit more -- and visit Tempe before assuming it will be more suitable.

- It‚Äôs perfectly fine to hike with your dog when the weather is nice. Many, many people do. 

- There are not a million things in the desert that can kill you. Only a few, and most leave you alone if you leave them alone. You could very well go years of hiking without seeing a rattlesnake, tarantula or other critter like that. 

- No one should be out hiking in summer, at least while the sun is up. Don‚Äôt let your dog walk unprotected on hot sidewalks in the summer. 

- Keep your dog on a leash at all times when hiking. Don‚Äôt let them wander off and stick their nose in a cactus or step on a cholla.

You're much more likely to have a suicidal cousin or a neighbor with schizophrenia in a delusional episode, and the police are ill suited to handle those situations. I can see the need for an armed wing of the state in certain particularly dangerous situations, but many of the tasks police perform shouldn't be theirs to do. It's frequently inappropriate to send someone with a gun--who has had it drilled into their heads that everyone might try to kill them--to things like traffic accidents, a person smoking weed, acts of vandalism, mental health crises, so on. Clearly an investigative wing of the state is important and justifiable, but that work is different than much of what police do. As for antagonizing people--that's basically their function. When not responding to a call (and sometimes then too), an officer patrols and looks for a way into contact with a person. This can be a real or invented infraction, may or may not be a crime or misdemeanor, may or may not be illegal. The goal is to find something that is illegal and can be used against the subject, or to find a way to cause them to admit to doing something illegal. Find an entry point and wheedle until you're further in, and go as far as you can or need. This frequently includes harassment and lying. I promise you I'm not being sensational here.

2646,2646,thatsnotminesir,"There is a lot of anger and towards AZPOST on this thread.  I wanted to provide some info that few know, and sadly, recives little to know academic research.

Arizona has the most powerful and effective standards and training board in the country. Every state has one (except Hawaii). But each is vastly different.  Some only set training standards, but have no licensing or enforcement power. Others have limited enforcement power (such as, they can only punish police certification if their agency fires them.)

Arizona is the only state with broad enforcement power, which has independent investigators that can take action whether or not the agency fires the officer.  Utah is a close second, but they do not have as strict of rules as AZ.  AZ can even instigate investigations based soley off citizen or media reports. No other state can do that.

Thats not to say AZ is perfect.  There are a LOT on issues and improvements AZPOST can make. Some recent events over the past few years caused them to take a few steps back.  But we are the strongest in the country.

My source is that I wrote my masters thesis on police certification power between various states, means to measure law enforcement integrity between states, and how effective strong police certification is.  I do have other inside info on the subject before I conducted the research. 

I could wrote another paper on the subject. But I'm sure some will ask about the thesis.  Long story story for the sake of a redditpost, there is absolutely no modern research on the various levels of enforcement power, and how effective those powers are, between various states. 

Roger Goldman of the St. Louis University College of Law is the leading expert on police licensing.  He is THE guy.  But even his research is solely on the need for police licensing, not the effectiveness of various levels of enforcement power.  Thats whats what I tried to do in my thesis.

Absent the time and resources for massive legal battles with most states, most states would not give me the data I asked for.  I did find that the states I sought data from that had the strongest police unions (I sought NY, MA, and CA) were the fastest to shut down the request, with formal ""its against state law"" letter from their district attorneys.

Other states (such as OH and UT, off the top of my head, there were others) simply ignored my open record requests 

I was only able to get the data I sought from two agencies in AZ and TX.  Not a large enough data set for a definitive conclusion, but there was a HUGE difference.   The AZ agency had SUBSTANTIALLY fewer officers still employed as cops who committed integrity violations than the TX agency.  And the main enforcement difference between AZ and TX is that TX can only revoke / suspend an officers certification if the agency fired the officer first.  AZ can revoke/suspend whether or not the agency takes any displinary action on the officer.

I'd have to dig out the paper for the exact number (wrote it 3 years ago) but right now my wife would be furious if I started digging through my papers as we prepare for bed.

TL:DR for my thesis: There is no exsisting research on various levels police certification enforcement power and its effects.  While the small data I could obatin showed the subject warrants further research, it would require the resources and funding to sue multiple states for the records, challenging numerous state laws im Court.",1579841607,ffeavqe

2705,2705,blakkstar6,"Do not move into a neighborhood with palm trees. They nest in them. Otherwise, they are common enough that we know how to proof against them mostly. A few tips:

Hang your shoes up at the end of the day. Don't store them on the floor. All our creepy crawlies love to hang out in shoes.

They despise concentrated essential oils like lavender or peppermint, so if you do end up having a problem, you can spray some of this in strategic spots, like entry ways and window sills. Also, maintain a clear, trimmed perimeter around your home. They like to hang out in shrubs and can get in your home that way.

It's a good idea to have a portable blacklight if you are outside at night. They are nocturnal, and they will light up like ravers under a blacklight.

There is not a chemical in the world that will kill these things (don't listen to anyone who says they can). If you do encounter one in your home, ye olde boot is the only reliable way to take them out. And *put your full weight into it for a few seconds*. They are tanks. And then burn it. Especially if it has babies like in the pic.

The majority of our species are not venomous, and the worst of them (the bark scorpion) won't kill you unless you have cardiological issues to begin with. Rule of thumb: the smaller they are, the more venomous they are. 1 inch or smaller: handle with care.

All that being said... It's really not that bad. We aren't at war with them. Having lived here for my whole life, I've only encountered a handful at very sporadic times. Arizona is a beautiful place; you just have to realize that it is a desert, and life is on the extreme end of kill or be killed here. A measure of precaution and alertness is necessary when in the wilder spots. The learning curve is part of the experience, and you will learn to appreciate it, I promise :)",1579894560,fffygzg

2735,2735,jmoriarty,"I'll answer a different question - is it worth paying for news/journalism?

Absolutely yes. If you've ever thought the current news sites like CNN or FOX News were garbage, and there is a lot of junk news out there and clickbaity headlines, the reason we got here is because people refuse to pay for news. They want to get it for free and not pay for a subscription.

That forces the news sites to make money from ads and clicks. They have to get as many clicks as possible, which leads to clickbait headlines and sensational stories to get people outraged so they comment and share it. It's turned news into entertainment, which they had to do to pay the bills. People like to blame ""the news"" for being bad, but their refusal to fund them to be good is part of what led us here.

AZ is like 46th in k-12/education. one of my kids came here starting in the 11th grade and took everything they had already. her last two years were mostly AP classes. I‚Äôm from Long Island and lived in Iowa for 9 years in between. Iowa is a better place to raise kids than NY or AZ. great schools, taxes are half of LI, but they take care of things and the people are nice. AZ has very cheap property taxes, but it shows. the plus sides are mild winters, low property taxes, there‚Äôs more going on than Iowa if you like professional sports and concerts, more diverse and more choices for food than Iowa. NY has everything good and bad and it‚Äôs expensive. I moved here for my wife‚Äôs job, so my circumstances are different. it‚Äôs a red state, but I think it‚Äôs starting to shift as people from expensive states move here. I tend to be libertarian and don‚Äôt belong to a political party, but that means I can‚Äôt vote in primaries. That said, if you move to the phoenix area, east valley is nicer than west valley, but more expensive. commutes from the west to east are worse too. it‚Äôs a huge state and maricopa county where I live is the size of new hampshire. the scenery is stunning and there‚Äôs a lot of outdoor activities one can do most of the year. summer sucks in the valley though. I‚Äôve been here almost 8 years and I‚Äôm not used to it. if I had the dough, I‚Äôd get a place on lake mary rd near flag. it‚Äôs nice up that way. heber overgard would be a second choice. somewhere to escape the summer heat. I actually miss rain too...job wise, it depends on what you do. my wife has done well, but she works for a national company. it‚Äôs taken me 7 years to equal what I was making in Iowa, but her salary went up 50%, so we‚Äôre doing better financially now. would I do it again? IDK. each move we‚Äôve made has had its challenges and in both cases it took time to smooth out. Iowa was a much bigger cultural shift for me. I had to take it down a notch or two and I am low key for a NYer. AZ was an easier adjustment socially, but work wise I had a hard time in the sector I work. Iowa can be the same way in that sector. if you‚Äôre not from there and don‚Äôt know someone, faggeddaboutit. if you work in private sector for a national or international company, much better, easier. good luck, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do well.",1580047393,ffm2ce4

When I first moved we decided on sierra vista which is south of tucson, the weather is perfect for getting used to the heat and you can get a feel of how people and things are here. I since moved to tucson and live on the east side, it's clean and there is a ton of things to do and love it, but I am glad I took a year down in sierra vista to get acclimated.hope you find a place you can call home here :) may I ask where in NH your from?",1580049082,ffm5wwh

Its so much more affordable and people are all around nicer. You can find super cheap housing in sierra vista but you will outgrow the area quickly. Tucson is also cheap but rent is increasing and there was a lot of competition when finding a place here. We did find a 2 bedroom house for $800 a month i a nice neighborhood on the east side of tucson. Utilities are cheaper and unlike NH your electric bill will be higher than your gas bill, we also can drive less than an hour and play in the snow on mt. Lemmon if we want to. One of the best things is the ability to actually have things to do, lots of actual stores and restaurants, real malls, and there are so many of these things that it feels like I finally have a choice of where I want to buy my things and where I eat, in NH there is no variety and your stuck going to Wal-Mart and the only McDonald's shared with 3 towns lol.

It‚Äôs also only an hour and a half drive from Phoenix and Flagstaff. It gets cold and snows in the winter but nothing you can‚Äôt handle. There‚Äôs enough to do to stay entertained and is a great place to raise a family, as it‚Äôs a one high school kind of town where everyone‚Äôs your neighbor. 

If you‚Äôre more focused on making money then the Phoenix area would provide a lot more opportunity. You say you‚Äôre not a city dweller but Phoenix is so spread out it feels like each area is it‚Äôs own little town. The city is also super easy to learn how to get around as the streets are designed in a perfect grid system. The best places to settle and raise a family would be north central Phoenix or Arcadia. It is slightly more expensive but the community and the people in it are nothing short of wonderful. It gets pretty hot in the summer but the other 3 seasons 100% make up for it with highs of about 70 on an average winter day. I‚Äôve heard great things about suburbs like Ahwatukee, Chandler, and Gilbert, but I‚Äôve personally never lived out there so I can‚Äôt vouch for it.

Flagstaff is beautiful and has wonderful weather, lots of off-roading and hiking, and during the Winter, skiing/snowboarding/tubing. Most of us don't even own an air conditioner because the summers are mild. BUT, it is very, very, very expensive to live here. Housing is impossible, especially because of the NAU students taking up a lot of housing and causing the demand to go up, which means the prices go up. It's not the only reason, but it's a big reason. Our town is small but it's growing rapidly, so it's getting pretty crowded. Groceries are also expensive. The tax here on food is over 11%. It's expensive to even go to fast food places here, let alone a restaurant. As far as politics, were pretty much split here 50/50. As far as the people, and I don't speak for everyone, but some people can be stuck up and snobby. Not everyone here likes outsiders, and they don't like when out-of-towners come to escape the heat or to play in the snow. Some especially don't take kindly to people from Phoenix. The motto here is *""Be nice or leave""* but it seems to be one sided. Not everyone is like this though. As far as jobs, it's very difficult to find a job here. There aren't many corporations here since we're a small town, but there are some. You are competing with 20k-30k NAU kids who will work for much less. If you would want to move here, you'd better have a job lined up beforehand, or you will be screwed. There's lots of jobs in the service industry, but they don't pay well. Flagstaff has however, made the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which will be in the next year or two, I can't remember which. $15 an hour sounds lovely, but it's going to screw the town because most of the businesses are small and local and it will put a lot of them out of business.

Overall though, I personally love it here and look past all the negatives because I feel that there are far more positives. It's so gosh darn beautiful here and if you like good weather and being outdoors, it's a nature lovers paradise. We have 1 million acres of pine Forest and we are less than 30 miles away from Sedona, depending on where in Flagstaff you live.

I hope this helps. Good luck with your decision.",1580089006,ffp8qlm

2952,2952,_KaseyRae_,"I moved here (knowing next-to-nothing) 1.5 years ago from MN and here is what I have learned thus far that may help:

We all justify the summer by reminding all non-Arizonans that, ""At least it's a dry heat."" Feels more like being in an oven than being hit with a wave of sweat and heavily breathing (humidity).

 Lots of day trips to Payson, Flagstaff, and Sedona where it's cooler than if you're in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Young adults have lots of pool parties to try to stay cool, sometimes with tents over the pool to help shield from the heat. Some nasty insects e.g. roaches and scorpions start trying to come inside as the heat climbs. But overall, other than the crazy sweat in your car while waiting for the AC, summer is quite tolerable compared to nasty winters and it's always beautiful scenery here. 5/6 am early morning walks at about 85 degrees, etc. Traffic is much lighter, as snowbirds and tourists avoid us like the plague in summertime lmao.

The dialect is a melting pot. Lots of midwesterners here, since many relocate in some capacity. Also an abundance of Hispanic folk and Indian reservations which is awesome diversity, and tons of Californians. Not ""southern hospitality"" so-to-speak, but most people are incredibly nice and friendly. And because we are technically in the South, there are Waffle Houses everywhere!

&gt;No, but an employer may choose to pay out unused earned paid sick time at the end of the employer‚Äôs year or at separation. The Fair Wages and Healthy Families Act does not require an employer to pay employees for unused earned paid sick time at the end of each year or at separation. An employer who elects to pay an employee for unused earned paid sick time at the end of the employer‚Äôs year must comply with the requirements of Arizona Revised Statutes ¬ß 23-372(D)(4).

3058,3058,DumpsterFire11,"Obligatory I am not a lawyer. From my casual browsing of the [relevant Arizona Revised Statues]((https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/23/00372.htm), there is something on the books that explicitly says that Arizona law does not require employers to pay out for unused earned sick time, specifically paragraph F which states ""Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from employment for accrued earned paid sick time that has not been used."" In short, while A.R.S does not prohibit employers from paying out unused earned sick time, it does not force them to either.


As a tangent for anyone interested, in the same section, paragraph D, item 4 states (paraphrased) that unused earned sick time must carry over through the next year, or alternatively be paid out at the end of the year on a yearly basis.

That's neat. I did not know that. So ""use it or lose it"" employers MUST pay your unused earned sick time if you're continuing on the next year and they don't allow you to roll over your hours (which is probably why all the places I worked allowed you to roll over hours. They don't want to pay it out).",1580184301,ffskzcj

I paid for the trip in advance as an Xmas present so I actually planned out our excursions.. this was a hit or miss. I originally rented slingshots/ the place was closed that week. I bought skydiving tickets for the Grand Canyon; it was too cold so yep that got canceled (we did the helicopter tour instead).

We kind of felt pressure from the bookings. And it sucks because some of these places you need to book or they sell out.  Sedona has a couple self guided atv rentals; that was amazing. Defiantly do that, we were able to book on site which was nice. Devils bridge is a nice hike. Sedona has a lot of cool little shops that you can stop at as well. 

We drove and stopped wherever. At one point we stopped because [this ](https://imgur.com/gallery/jVKTweZ) black mirror reference.  The marble canyon and glen canyon area itself is miraculous.  We loved the whole authenticity of the town page. It felt rural. We went to shooting range, it was insane! I really felt like I was in the west and I think that was more of the feel we were looking for. 

I would kind of center yourself around flagstaff. We stayed at the buttes in phx; it was nice but nothing compares to once you venture north.",1580186627,ffsnwtx

I doubt they had beanbag rounds on them going in since they were responding to a report about a man with a gun. By paintball rounds I assume you mean pepper rounds and not actually paintball, in which case that would be just like using pepper spray. Baton is still allowing a dangerous armed suspect get way to close. Cops are not in any way judge, jury, and executioner. They are in fact taught to aim for center mass, not to kill. 

Also tranquilizer? What are they suppose to do? Shoot him with a dart and then run around in circles till it starts to take effect?",1580320614,ffx9lqw

Pepper spray - Some people are outright immune to it. CS chambers in the military prove this.

Taser - ARE LETHAL WEAPONS. But they often deploy incorrectly... as in VERY often. Drugged up individuals also seem to have resistance to it.

Tranquilizer - are nowhere near instant. Take a good minute or two at the minimum to kick into effect... Beyond long enough for knife wielder to kill someone.

Paintball - You realize people play this game for fun right? Even if you pump up the FPS of the gun and use rubber balls... most it does is sting and break skin causing bleeding.

Beanbag - I will assume beanbag shotgun style thing... You might break some bones using this... possibly the only thing here that could ""universally"" work... Except that it's still potentially lethal... But now you have to carry a shotgun everywhere... All the time. Not practical for a cop to be carrying a shotgun in the majority of their duty.

Baton - Yes, put yourself at even advantage to the person coming at you with a sharper object. How about we don't require people to take a knife to the face.

So your solution then is to make a copy carry several of these mechanisms... then deploy multiple? You realize a person can cover 30 ft with a knife and kill in seconds right? You wouldn't have time to draw multiple weapons.",1580321080,ffxadrp

They even attended a Doggie Day Care Luau and we were sent home with adorable prints of each pup wearing a lei in front of a tiki display.  They developed a 'play pack' with a few other pups that were boarding there during our longest trip - they apparently made friends with 5 other pups and would hang out in day care with their new friends.

Keep in mind that the north rim of the GC is closed during winter, it‚Äôs a far very drive from the south rim and I‚Äôve heard some unfortunate stories of people making the drive only to find it closed. The main entrance at the south rim is very busy, but it really doesn‚Äôt take much to get far away from the crowds. Drive a ways to the east of GC village along SR-64, some would say the viewpoints aren‚Äôt as good (except until you get to the end) but it‚Äôs the Grand Canyon, it‚Äôs going to be amazing anywhere you go.

As for couch surfing - Flagstaff is about an hour and a half or so from the Grand Canyon and there‚Äôs tons of affordable lodging there. Where you stay depends on how long you want to be at the canyon, and that depends on what you‚Äôre going to do at the canyon, but unless you‚Äôre planning on doing a big hike (which I can give advice on if you are interested, TL;DR it‚Äôs amazing but difficult and icy at the top this time of year) you can totally do the canyon in a day. I love starting in Flag, heading up via Williams, taking SR-64 to Cameron along the rim, then following US-89 back to Flag. Great loop, and you can start and end in Flagstaff.

You could of course camp, but I assume not because you‚Äôre flying in. If you are considering camping, try somewhere lower elevation because it‚Äôll be pretty cold at night in the area around Flag and the GC. I have recommendations for places if you‚Äôre interested. 

Sedona - absolutely beautiful, but I find most of the town/city part of it to be one of the worst tourist traps I‚Äôve seen in my life. I personally would stay away from that, but look into it because plenty of my friends love it. If you‚Äôre looking for nature, try the hike to Devil‚Äôs Bridge (haven‚Äôt done it myself but seen many pictures of it) and the drive up Oak Creek Canyon to Flagstaff v√≠a US-89A. Too cold to swim this time of year but Slide Rock might be worth a look along the way, though it can get pretty busy. West Fork of Oak Creek is an amazing hike too.",1580365401,ffz6d90

If you have some hiking recommendations that would be awesome, but something that doesn't require me getting any additional equipment to my hiking shoes please. I would say am an experienced hiker as I hiked some of the *strenuous* trails around the country. So I'd be very interested to hearing your suggestions for some not-to-miss trails around the area (up to 9 miles a day). 

As for camping, sadly, I won't be able to camp as I won't have my gear and I think it'd be way too cold anyways, so I'm planning to either couch surf (never used it before) or find myself some lodge around the area too (if its not crazy expensive).",1580395895,ffzy6it

Keep them on the outside area and you‚Äôll have no issues. If you drop down in the canyon then the ice typically switches to mud in short time. 

Sedona has some amazing hiking as well and may warrant at least a short detour in the way to hit an easy trail or two. Conditions there will be warmer and unless a decent system has rolled through you shouldn‚Äôt have much issue with trail conditions.

&gt;The title comes from a section of Arizona State Route 74 in north Phoenix. Said Lightfoot, ""I thought it would make a good title for a song. I wrote it down, put it in my suitcase and it stayed there for eight months."" The song employs ""Carefree Highway"" as a metaphor for the state of mind where the singer seeks escape from his ruminations over a long ago failed affair with a woman named Ann. Lightfoot has stated that Ann actually was the name of a woman Lightfoot romanced when he was age 22: ""It \[was\] one of those situations where you meet that one woman who knocks you out and then leaves you standing there and says she's on her way.""

We should set our registration lower than all other stated (or at least Illinois the biggest offender) and raise gas taxes to make up the difference.

3604,3604,bschmidt25,"Long story short, it has to do with how we fund local government in Arizona. Property taxes are low, so the money comes from somewhere else (sales taxes and the VLT). Other states are much more dependent on property taxes.

There are two parts to the fees: registration and vehicle license tax (VLT). The registration component is fixed and inexpensive: $8 for the registration / renewal fee and $1.50 for clean air fee, plus a new $32 public safety fee (about to be repealed or reduced I believe). The VLT is based on the value and age of your vehicle. Someone else cited the calculation, but it's roughly, $500 to register a new $30k vehicle and goes down 16% per year. So it starts high and goes down pretty quickly. About 50% of the VLT funds roads and the other 50% goes to the general fund for your city or county (~25% each). If you have an old car, it can be *less* to register here than other states. For example, before they implemented the public safety fee I was able to register my 2004 BMW 3 series for $40 a year.

With medical costs so high because we can't get out of this private insurance profit machine, she couldn't even afford the pre natal care she needed that may have kept her in the workplace a little longer.

Phoenix has some of the worst winter air quality in the state, so their gas blend is designed to alleviate some of it.  Downside is that the blend is only sold in Maricopa County,  not the standard ""stock"" blend that gas companies can sell anywhere else in the state.

If you're looking to buy, cash is king. Usually you can negotiate prices if you buy in bulk and/or with cash.

Your dates fortunately overlap with a number of shows. Top of the list, a must-see is at AGTA. [Look online if you think you can get into this show](https://agta.org) before your departure. Often they require a lengthy amount of paperwork to prove your credentials. If you get into, see this particular booth by the name of Somewhere in the Rainbow, you'll find it along a wall. If you can get into AGTA, then it'll be easy for you to jump over to GJX. Then check out the Pueblo on that same street, but a block west under the freeway. A few more shows to check out is TEP, 22nd St show as well as Hotel Tucson. Finally, on your last day, see the Tucson Gem &amp; Mineral show.

4010,4010,UGetOffMyLawn,"Scottsdale and Tempe are suburbs of Phoenix.  You can stay in one and easily access the others.  Please be aware that in the summer daytime temps are easily 105-115F.  Outdoor activities like hiking are generally not recommended but for the most physically fit and even then only before 8-9am in the morning.

Sedona is also a popular spot and is outside of Phoenix by about 2 hours.  Sedona is know for its spas, resorts, famous red rocks, hiking and overall outdoor/nature.  In the summer it is usually about 20 degrees cooler than the metropolitan Phoenix area.  Sedona is more of a relaxation area and not known for hot clubbin' action.

Flagstaff is 3-4 hours north of Phoenix (depending on traffic) and has just about everything from outdoor activities, clubs/bars (also a college town) to great food options.  Since they are a higher elevation they are usually about 30 degrees cooler than Phoenix during the summer but the sun is a bit more intense.

Tucson is also a great option with museums, world class resorts/spas, college bar action, stellar food and just about all outdoor activities.  They are generally cooler temp (about 10-20) wise than Phoenix but still get hot hot hot.  Tucson is south of Phoenix by around 2 hours depending on traffic and construction.  It is closer to the border of Mexico.

Population wise Phoenix is the largest city.  The greater metropolitan Phoenix area (all the suburbs) is the largest population center in Arizona.

There are many other smaller towns that could make for a great time depending on what the interests are.  Jerome and Bisbee are two that come to mind immediately.",1580852584,fgjw7bl

I don't know what the actual numbers are, but I am sure there is some benefit on the other side of the equation, that would balance out the facts if they were disclosed.  I mean, AZ businesses made these decisions; China didn't take that 2.2% by force, they offered a competitive advantage to those businesses in some way, which is passed on to the state in other ways.

As far as withholding aid by the executive branch, I agree that's not good. The tricky part with the Impoundment Control Act is that the President is able to temporarily withhold aid as long as it's released before the end of the fiscal year. Since it was released on September 11th, the law wouldnt have been broken until October 1st. It's not as cut and dry as him illegally withholding aid, there's a lot more to it and the violation of that law is hazy.

It is an abuse of power to use your position in a political office to press a foreign government into doing an action for the sole purpose of helping your political campaign.

&gt;Was there proof that Trump did this strictly for political gain?

Yes. Trump's team has released records that show that the Ukraine did not actually have to open an investigation, only that they needed to announce that they were doing so on CNN. This shows that the purpose of this action was not to ""root out corruption"" but to self-serve.

&gt;Is there any proof that the Democrats started this whole investigation strictly for political gain?

She stood up for an authoritarian that wants to be dictator that just may become one with the help of a certain tribe and additional authoritarian appeasers.

If she didn't vote to remove [Bratva Benedict Donald](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate) I would have voted to remove Sinema.

Good call Sinema, history will view the non-traitors kindly. The ones that voted to aquit Trump will be nothing but a Trump authoritarian appeaser in history.  Authoritarian appeasers get thrown under the bus first by their own authoritarians.

It blows my mind people think going with authoritarians like Putin and puppet Trump will help them win long term, maybe short term, but authoritarian appeasers get thrown under the bus first by their own authoritarians, eventually the anger/hate turns inward.

Authoritarians go until they are stopped with offense, not defense. It is especially helpful if their own appeasers turn on the authoritarians before it happens the other direction.

Even [Dr. Seuss knew you can't appease authoritarians](https://imgur.com/a/U5iVr30).

Underestimate the new wave of [Putin authoritarianism like this scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://youtu.be/DPXG4pdPj4w?t=13).

The cheaters are winning, you can't cooperate with cheaters. Authoritarians are on offensive offense, you can't just play defense, you have to play offense to get them on defense.

In game theory, if the other side cheats and your side keeps cooperating, you will lose every time. There is a [great little game theory game that highlights it here called The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/).

The committee then chooses whether to pursue articles of impeachment against the accused official and report them to the full House. If the articles are adopted (by simple majority vote), the House appoints Members by resolution to manage the ensuing Senate trial on its behalf.""

Pelosi intiated an ""inquiry"" which was conducted in secret. A clear violation of the process as outlined by the Judiciary. Schiff and Nadler concocted the Articles and Nancy sat on them, clueless as to how to proceed without the House voting on the Articles.",1581022615,fgqeh1f

As long as there's not a sign saying you can't camp, it's pretty safe to assume you can. 

But...don't just go driving off across the desert in your truck.  There's thousands of miles of rarely traveled dirt roads and jeep trails. Stick to those.

It's been a while since I've worked there and can't remember.

\- No Daylight Saving Time (DST is a pain in the ass and it's literally lying about the real time)

\- I like the dryness. It means I don't get soaked in sweat when it's 90 outside and from the times I've been to Arizona before I found a complete lack of mosquitoes.

\- Astronomy is so much better there. In much of the state there are no forests to block the sky and there are more places to find dark skies. The dryness again helps as it means the skies are clear of clouds most of the time (especially the more southwest you go, I hear.)

\- The scenery is awesome. Of all the states I've been to, nothing compares to Arizona. Mountains, canyons, badlands, even an impact crater... It's all great.

\- I like the variety of snowfall. The entire state of Minnesota tends to get snow from October through April but in Arizona you can have everything from no snow year-round to snow from October through May in Flagstaff.

\- I like the flora and fauna.

Now these fuckers are mean. The goal of each pod is basically to get stuck to a coyote of rabbit then kill it and grow from there. 

The spines break off in bunches. They are coated in paraffin so they slide easily into the skin. They are also barbed(like a fish hook) and segmented. So once they are in your skin the swell due to the moisture making it just about impossible to pull out. On top of that the segmentation means when you try to get it out it'll break off at the skin level. Just about the only choice is painkillers and waiting for your body to break it down which generally takes 7-14 days if not longer. See above about killing small game to spread and grow.

Via /u/PinheadLarry2323

The ACTUAL facts about gun violence in America

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

‚Ä¢ 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

‚Ä¢ 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

‚Ä¢ 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&amp;amp;context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

To answer your question I‚Äôve given you one already however you continue to ignore it. Another one could be hog hunters in Texas. Hogs being an invasive species are causing millions in damages. They‚Äôre also intelligent so you best get all of them all at once or else they get smarter as they get older and harder to hunt. A semiautomatic rifle with a standard (30 round) or larger magazine helps the hunters to get the hogs causing damage on the property taken care of all at once. In a broader sense all firearms are created with a purpose in mind. Some for hunting, some sport shooting, and yes, a lot of them are made to kill other people.

On a side note, you can‚Äôt claim that you‚Äôre proud to be ignorant about firearms, then in the same breath state that nobody ever needs anything more than I pistol like you‚Äôre some kind of expert. You can‚Äôt make a statement like that without at least a limited understanding of the firearms hobby. You claim to know nothing and your arguments only further prove it.

It's a nice town, I like it a lot. We have our own colleges here too, Yavapai and Prescott, so we have a good amount of college-aged people here too. IIRC this is one of the highest population senior towns in the country, Arizona tho is a retirement state in general. And our population is growing pretty rapidly, lots of new suburbs are being built to house all these new people, so that makes living costs here pretty high (cheapest apartments I know of in the area go for $900 for one bed/bath). So it's a little town, but it's booming for sure. Roads tend to be pretty jammed too, especially around the downtown area.

What I like living here the most though is how nature-y it is. There's tons of hiking spots around the area, Watson Lake is my favorite. Locals here tend to be pretty friendly too, and there's lots of locally owned businesses. 

Main attraction here is our downtown area, aka The Square. So that's where the famous courthouse is, still in use today. That's where there's a lot of locally owned businesses are, and the infamous whiskey row, I can't tell you how that is cuz I'm not 21 yet lol.

That‚Äôs what we should have expected. 

Seriously, the great threat to our state right now and to our nation‚Äôs future is to elect another democrat into the Senate. It‚Äôs bad enough with Sinema, who does not represent this state as a whole.  She won only 5 of the 15 counties and only the state by 55k votes, less than 2.4%.

Problem is Sinema is a shallow do-nothing democrat.  Y‚Äôall knew that and voted her in anyway. She just goes along with the crowd.  I‚Äôm not saying McSally is any different.  Mark Kelly is just another shallow democrat with absolutely nothing new or innovative to offer.  Why deviate from D and R if we‚Äôre just getting another bought vote?

Ask Mark how he would compare his ideas to great statesmen like Kennedy, FDR, Lincoln, Reagan.  What is he bringing that is new and innovative and may go against his party line?  

Our biggest issues right now are not healthcare or immigration or guns. It‚Äôs big government, national debt, and SS.  10% cut in Gov rolls. 2% sales tax on goods and services (1% to get the debt down and 1% to get SS entitlements funded).

How I‚Äôve seen it treated in a civilian company is a little different.  If you‚Äôre involved in a workplace incident and test positive, then card or not, you‚Äôre probably gone.

And he did that while keeping in mind the sensitivities of 5 different Native American cultures.

5602,5602,derkrieger,"Correct and I explained above why that negative attitude exists. A lot of gun control legislation that has been introduced was created by people on one side of the aisle, without seeking neutral expert advice, and instead frequently targets aesthetic features. You've also had absurd suggestions such as every bullet be registered which are de facto bans (not that those were ever that popular of suggestions in the first place) that frighten people. If they hear extremism at one end they run to the extremism at the other end for help. Most gun control legislation has not been to ban all guns but you have a loud vocal minority who advocate for that and praise any gun control legislation as a step in that regard. This is what scares anyone who supports guns from compromise as it is frequently seen as a slope with no end. There is a popular comic strip that shows how some people view it which I'll link below. Moral of the story is you'll never get anything passed without involving the other side because the numbers simply aren't there. People with different beliefs aren't your enemy and CAN be reasoned with but taking the first step in that regard instead of alienating them is going to get you a hell of a lot farther.

Your example of Reagan in itself is vague and uses tags ‚Äúbig money‚Äù and ‚Äúugly‚Äù politics in your argument alongside your judgement of ‚Äúworst president in history‚Äù.  Is that an attempt to mask your own knowledge or promote the lack thereof?  

A poll of historians is attached. My examples I used were #s 1, 3, 8, and 9, and not just popular names.  Look at who they polled and how the poll was framed. 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/where-does-obama-rank-among-us-presidents-c-span-poll-gives-high-marks-2017-02-17

(And Obama is/was riding a popular wave to be ranked so highly. 25 years from now he‚Äôll be next to Jimmy Carter, a better philanthropist than a president. IMO)

Bernie is nothing close to a transcendent leader.  Heck, he can‚Äôt even pick a party and be consistent. Bernie‚Äôs a man without a plan, pandering to buzz topics to buy votes with no real plan to make his agenda truly viable.  I could argue Trump does the same, although he has a plan through all of the tweets and is working through his agenda. We all wish he were more eloquent, but we get the whole package.  The only D candidate out there that actually acts and talks like a statesman is Buttigieg, but his party-line policies will keep him from ascending across the binary system.  Bloomberg is just another billionaire with an ego wanting to beat another billionaire.  We‚Äôd all be better off if he spent his money on charities rather than a whiny bid for the White House. 

‚ÄúWe are in a Binary system‚Äù and ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt given a choice‚Äù is pure victimhood and shows an utter lack of personal responsibility. You can always write-in a candidate.

5729,5729,StevenGannJr,"Plecos are a harmful invasive species, but I never encountered one in the wild myself. 

In Florida's estuaries, hardhead catfish are extraordinarily prolific, taste awful, and are extremely easy to catch. They're accused of driving down populations of desirable fishes like snook and sheep's head by predation of smaller fry and generally reducing the food supply. Fisherman call them trash fish because they taste horrible and are so full of bones they're just not worth the effort to try eating. I think they're native to the Atlantic, though, so not invasive, just a pest.

Sort of like goliath grouper, which were almost hunted to extinction and are now a protected species, but they are now so numerous and voracious that they're demolishing the spiny lobster populations.

It is absolutely insane the number of animals that are killed on highways and roads, but we have virtually no significant wildlife fencing, very few wildlife underpasses, development intrudes into their space, people lure them into neighborhoods, just for them to suffer on a roadside berm.

If not, Peralta Trail will give you great views at the top on both sides of the peak (moderate hiking level here). There's also a little ghost town called Goldfield near the Superstitions that is a really fun and cute place to go. 

For food, there are a lot of great places in downtown Phoenix particularly across from the basketball arena (Talking Stick Resort Arena). I'm more of a fan of downtown Chandler and downtown Gilbert places to eat myself though. Love the atmosphere there. There are so many to choose from at both areas, it's hard to suggest just one.

Start with where you'll be working and do a search within a 20 minute drive in all directions.  Huge difference between Scottsdale and Tolleson.  

One upshot to Phoenix is that Uber is pretty inexpensive and reliable.  Combined with the light rail going through central Phoenix and Tempe it is possible to live without a car for a few months until you get settled.  Knew a guy that had a family of four living in downtown Phoenix without a car.  Used Uber for grocery store trips and rented a car when they needed to go out of town.

What leads you to believe that there are *less* of these people now rather than *more*? Trump has not *gained* approval in almost any metric in existence since his election, save maybe within his own narrow immediate base. You can't win an election with 40% of the electorate. 

&gt;it's got landslide potential.

No president has been re-elected without reaching at least 50% approval. Trump has never achieved this. TV ratings/Twitter followers/Rally attendance ‚â† approval/votes

&gt;I'd be more worried about keeping places like Nevada, Virginia and Colorado if I were on the left.

Nevada is part of the ""sun belt"" of states that has been becoming more blue and purple over the last decade. It already voted for Hillary over Trump in 2016. Nevada has 6 electoral votes. I don't think dems are afraid of losing Nevada. Trump is the one who was there yesterday, kinda sounds like he is afraid, no? 
Colorado has had a massive influx of Latinos over the decade. This demographic typically leans blue. Colorado also already voted for Hillary in 2016 by a larger margin than Nevada. Democrats are not concerned with Colorado.

6111,6111,UGetOffMyLawn,"&gt; 1) how are people about pets, will we be able to find a place that we can have our 3 dogs?

Seems like just about everyone here has dogs or wants them if they don't already have them.  Keep in mind that apartments or any type of rental type of housing usually has some restrictions on number of animals, weight of animals, breed of dogs.  So this is something you should be aware of beforehand.  If you own a house, condo or townhome you are only limited by your HOA (if applicable), homeowners insurance or city/county restrictions which are usually less restrictive.

&gt; 2) are people super nosy or keeping to themselves? (What will my typical neighbours be like)

Generally we tend to be of the mindset in Arizona of 'live and let live.""  With that said, it is like anywhere else that your street, apartment floor, complex will most likely have that one neighbor.  Seems to just be human nature.  Usually it is a lonely older person who is just looking for some company in my experience.

&gt; 3) will we be welcomed as foreigners?

Absolutely.  One thing you will quickly figure out is that just about no one in Arizona is from Arizona.  The natives are rare and illusive.

&gt; 4) what does the average couple with 3 dogs spend in a month for food / rent/ utilities / transportation?

This is lifestyle dependent.  Check out /r/phoenix and some of the threads there to get a better idea.

&gt; 5) how hard is it to get around if you dont have a car?

Depends on how far you live from where you work.  Depends on where you socialize from where you live.  It isn't the worst place to live as our public transportation is better now that it was 10-20 years ago and it will get you where you need to go.  It is also being expanded.  It is safe, relatively inexpensive and with the addition of rideshare (Uber and Lyft) and bikes/scooters we are much better off.

&gt; 6) are you a friendly bunch?

1000 times more friendly than Philly!

&gt; 7) what topic should i avoid at all costs in order to not offend anyone?

In person?  Don't call us Zonies.",1582226121,fi7q5x2

A few years ago, I was ferrying around a consultant from the midwest, whom my (Tucson) office flew in for some consulting. She was here in November, and managed to come in the 3 days it was gloomy and rainy.

On the last day, she asks me, kinda sheepish, ""So I've noticed this...awful smell...when it rains. What is it? It's horrible!"" I laughed and told her it's the creosote and folks either love it or hate it.

She was so sheepish because she kept hearing people talk about how they love the smell of the desert when it rains and thought she was losing it for not smelling whatever it was that was so wonderful.

The Hudson is also pretty good. A good dinner option. Try the prickly pear babyback ribs.

Check out Timo, it's a little tucked-away wine bar and wood oven pizza place.

You can work on campus for 12-16 dollars an hour or find a job at a nearby restaurant, etc. Any job you can imagine is in Arizona and nearby ASU. It won‚Äôt be hard at all. I suggest getting one job through the school for your first semester and after meeting roommates and classmates and exploring the college city you can find a better position. You don‚Äôt really need a car. It will be brutally hot in summer but parking is hard to find and expensive on campus so everyone rides bikes or motorized scooters or walks. I would give yourself at least 500 a month for food. The remaining money of your stipend will likely be used for utilities and transportation.

Here are a few reasons why:

* Muliple cars but a plate is only valid for one. 

* Placards can go with you when traveling for a rental vehicle and are valid in all states. Plates cannot. 

* Placards can go with you in a rideshare, friends car, any other vehicle that may need to take you somewhere and pull up closer or into a disabled spot to drop off or pick up.

Day 4: Sedona to Page (stopping at the South Rim, and Monument Valley)

Day 5: Page to Vegas (through Zion NTNL Park)

Day 6: Vegas (Valley of Fire, Hoover Dam)

Day 7: Fly Home

On day 4 you‚Äôd be looking at 2-1/2 hours to the South Rim, then another hour and a half to Cameron from there, and then close to two hours to Monument Valley, and then around two hours back to Page. You wouldn‚Äôt have time to see really much of anything.  

Monument Valley is pretty, but it's out of the way and shouldn‚Äôt be considered a side trip.  I‚Äôd consider skipping it on this trip because it‚Äôs going to eat up six hours of daylight. In Page, look up Glen Canyon half day float trips. It‚Äôs a fifteen mile smooth water raft trip and it‚Äôs gorgeous.  You can look into Antelope Canyon tours and see Horseshoe Bend, although both are very crowded.  There are kayak tours of Antelope Canyon on the water side and that‚Äôs really neat.  You can tour Glen Canyon Dam (25 feet shorter than Hoover but it‚Äôs actually a bigger dam) there as well. 

On your way through to Zion, there‚Äôs a trailhead for The Toadstools about 20 miles west of Page. It‚Äôs a short hike, like about 2 miles round trip, and it‚Äôs an easy one.  The Toadstool hoodoos are really cool.  Be warned that Zion is EXTREMELY crowded. If you can set things up so you‚Äôre there before sunrise, all the better.  Bryce Canyon is not far from Zion and it‚Äôs really cool.   

If you‚Äôre looking at doing two or three national parks, buy the $80 America The Beautiful pass. It‚Äôs good for a year and gets you into any NPS or USFS fee area. Grand Canyon and Zion both have $35 entry fees so you‚Äôll only be $10 behind at that point. (If you did Bryce, I think that‚Äôs $30.) Get a burger in Page at Slackers... sooooo good.

- Dirty: Allowing construction crews to use inside restrooms could cause extra work on the janitorial staff having to clean-up the dirt / mud / dust, etc. Especially if this is an inside up-scale mall where 'appearance' is highly regarded.

- Damage: Construction clothing is more rugged and has more nooks / folds. Scuff marks from boots can get on tile or nails / fasteners stuck in shoes could scrape the floors.

- Safety issue: A nail, screw, fastener, etc could fall out of your clothing and someone in open-toe shoes could step on it and hurt themselves. Or potential location for setting down inappropriate tools that may walk-off or might be forgotten.

Not to mention, I'm pretty sure the main reason is construction crews are employed by the construction company. If a construction worker were to get hurt, for any reasons, businesses want to minimize their risk.

So the pronunciation is basically a FU to the British.

You meet them at Lees Ferry and they take you 15 miles upstream all the way almost to Glen Canyon Dam. From there, you float the 15 miles back to Lees Ferry on the Colorado. It's all smooth water, no rapids. The canyon walls rise hundreds of feet on both sides. There are petroglyphs along the way. There are 6 camping areas along the way and I highly recommend making it an overnight; you can even camp at the bottom of Horseshoe Bend if you like.  When you get going again early the next morning, you'll find a level of peace and quiet you've rarely ever experienced. You will see huge trout swimming under your boat most of the way.

But wait, there's more! When you get back to Lees Ferry and get the kayak loaded up, head towards Page and go to the Antelope Point launch ramp at Lake Powell. Launch from there and kayak Antelope Canyon. It's about 3 miles each way and you can hike about a mile or so at the end. It's fantastic.

You may wish to consider the impact of publishing lists like this.

This is particularly true of old mines and ranch buildings, remote cabins and line shacks  -- many of the ones that I used to visit that had intact equipment from the 1800s, and which I would go to in the 80's and 90's, have been razed to the ground.

Some people are just pointlessly destructive, they're thieves, or they're just stupid.

6920,6920,LilyLove84,"Pinball.... I'm not sure. But, there is definitely no shortage of hikes in Arizona. If you'll pass through to the North, the Grand Canyon trails area a must! There's also Antelope canyon and Horseshoe Bend (more of a tour than a hike for Antelope Canyon, but still a must see) in Page.

If you don't want to go as far North as that, and will be taking the I-40. You can catch some of Route 66 going that way for some fun and well known sights as you pass through Flagstaff and near Sedona which both have AMAZING hiking options for you. Don't forget to stop at Pine County in Williams for the most amazing pie ever. Flagstaff and Sedona will have good vegan locations you can search for as well. 

If you go the route of the I-10, Phoenix has a ton of great food options, search vegan, and have at it. Camelback Mountain is a great hike! And further East, any Hikes in the Superstition Mountains are fantastic! I personally love Massacre Ground, Siphon Draw to Flat Iron, and Peralta Trail. Be sure to stop by Goldfield Ghost Town for some fun and to be taken back to the old days of the West. 

If you go further South through Tucson, I am not as well versed. Being a Sun Devil, I only venture to Wildcat territory when ASU plays them for football. I know they have several Mountain ranges around them though that I'm sure they have beautiful hiking options. Plus that route will allow you to experience the wild wild West in the most famous town of that time if you stop in Tombstone. Benson and Bisbee are pretty to look at as well.",1583078606,fj6rjg1

You're also not taking into account that individual soldiers--hundreds of thousands of them-- weren't motivated to fight by slavery. Professor Gary Gallagher's study of soldiers' journals and letters showed that slavery wasnt a motivating factor for 90% of them (on Confederate or Union side). The Confederate flag represents my ancestor's courage and loyalty in willing to fight back against an invading army he thought were his countrymen.

The one I know did, chose to put his life at risk because he felt Lincoln's invasion of the south was unjust, and an infringement on his, and his countrymen's, rights. Also, from reading his memoirs, I think he found it natural to defend his home when invaded. I suspect this was far more often a motivation for most southern soldiers, than slavery.

My great-great-grandfather was injured in the Seven Days, survived a prison camp where guards were allowed to murder inmates, and came back to fight again after both of those. He's set an example I'll likely never live up to. 

I'm definitely not pro-slavery, and I'd be shocked to find anyone (pro flag or otherwise) who is nowadays. I think most of us who support the flag, and monuments/memorials, are far more motivated by history and heritage. The flag isnt something old and forgotten for us, it's a matter of family-- literally, if your ancestors fought in the Confederate army.

On top of that, you're not answering my point about the motivations of common soldiers, which rarely had anything to do with slavery. The flag represents those, too.

7098,7098,vankorgan,"&gt;They also refer to other reasons. 

No. Not as the primary reason. Every single one gives the continued enslavement of blacks as the primary reason for secession. Slavery was the economic backbone of the South. Even poor Confederate non-slavers benefited from slavery, and they were not ignorant to the fact that the North meant to free the slaves. 

Please read [this article,](https://acwm.org/blog/myths-and-misunderstandings-slaveholding-and-confederate-soldier) I think it does a good job of addressing the ""my ancestors didn't own slaves so they couldn't have been fighting for slavery"" idea. 

A decent excerpt:

&gt;Confederate soldiers rarely expressed a pure proslavery ideology in letters and diaries. ([To paraphrase James McPherson](https://www.amazon.com/Cause-Comrades-Why-Fought-Civil/dp/0195124995/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502222727&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=for+cause+and+comrades), they felt no need to state the obvious.) Most often, they used popular shorthand like¬†Yankee ‚Äúfanatics,‚Äù or ‚Äúour domestic relations,‚Äù hinting at how slavery fit into larger worldviews more readily understood. Few, if any, expressed skepticism about slavery in direct or indirect terms, and consistently defined the enemy as ‚Äúabolitionists.‚Äù

&gt;Historian¬†[Joseph Glatthaar‚Äôs statistical analysis](https://www.amazon.com/General-Lees-Army-Victory-Collapse/dp/1416596976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502222994&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=general+lee%27s+army)¬†of the 1861 volunteers in what would become the Army of Northern Virginia reveals that one in 10 owned a slave and that one in four lived with parents who were slave-owners. Both exceeded ratios in the general population, in which one in 20 owned a slave and one in five lived in a slaveholding household. ‚ÄúThus,‚Äù Glatthaar notes, ‚Äúvolunteers in 1861 were 42 percent more likely to own slaves themselves or to live with family members who owned slaves than the general population.‚Äù In short, Confederate volunteers actually owned more slaves than the general population. ¬†

&gt;In fact, non-slaveholding soldiers from regions with fewer African Americans likely received greater exposure to slavery for having joined the army. The military regularly used slaves and implemented proslavery policies.¬†[The army conscripted slave labor on a massive scale](https://www.amazon.com/Confederate-Slave-Impressment-Upper-America/dp/1469626489/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502223058&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=confederate+impressment)¬†for transportation, and in construction of military defenses. It also¬†[captured and returned to slavery](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ma-XQ2KqkyIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=virginia%27s%20civil%20war&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)¬†thousands of escaped and free black men and women. Soldiers acted on fears of ‚Äúservile insurrection‚Äù when¬†[they summarily murdered](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Battle-Crater-Directions-Southern/dp/0813169720/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502223347&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=the+battle+of+the+crater)¬†United States Colored Troops at Fort Pillow and the Battle of the Crater.

If your ancestors fought for the South, they likely espoused proslavery stances and even may have been personally responsible for hunting down humans and returning them to a life of slavery. 

Many Confederate soldiers took these roles when needed. Can you honestly say for a fact that your ancestors did not? Do you feel that's a thing to be proud of?",1583208946,fjc592c

7100,7100,jblade91,"Thanks for the detailed answer. The meaning behind symbols change over time. I do think by displaying it you have to remain aware of what it looks like to those on the outside. However, I can see supporting veteran ancestors. I never thought about it as an invasion and not just about owning slaves.

A lot of times we move on from the past. We dont still hate the Japanese for Pearl Harbor or Germans for Nazis. It was a past war from people who are nearly gone from the world and most of the world has moved on. The Confederacy is different for us because it was us against ourselves. It's easy to support our troops when they're not fighting each other.

While I hope those who wave it are self aware of how its perceived and understand those who look down on it, I can also respect someone who wants to respect a family member who fought for their home.

7102,7102,Jortsftw,"I disagree, for several reasons:

1) In the cases of TX and VA, slavery isn't the primary thing they mention. Both documents are primarily concerned with the relationship between state and Union. In the case of TX, it's also a matter of the fact they were a sovereign nation first, which adds another dimension to the discussion. Slavery is a secondary concern to state sovereignty in those documents. Actually, I could just as easily argue that this is the sort of situation where the McPherson quote about ""no need to state the obvious"" applies: state-level control was the overarching idea, so even if it's not as front-and-center in the cases of the other four states in that link, that's because local control was always a given in the agrarian, geographically spread out south, far more than in the more tightly packed, interdependent mid-Atlantic and north. If you haven't read the book Albion's Seed, it's a phenomenal piece of scholarship that demonstrates how many parts of the same regional identity that drove the Civil War were already present in the English regional cultures of the original colonists. It's those cultures, I'd argue (local control and independence being major features of both) that far better explain Southern motivations, and thinking.

2) skimmed the article (it's late), and it's missing the point. I think it does a clever job of framing the issue, but that framing reveals the author's bias. For one, if you're going to argue that the absence of talk about slavery is proof that slavery was foremost in their minds, you're going to need a lot more evidence than ""it must have been important, because it was everywhere."" That's imputing intent where no proof of it exists. The author makes a claim from Glaathaar's analysis, that oversteps its source: Glaathaar is talking about one army in the CSA. But even if I I concede that to the article's author, mentioning that volunteers came from slave owning families, is not the same as an analysis of soldiers' motivations. That's circumstantial evidence. Even small things in the article reflect the author's over-focus on slavery: using ""our domestic relations"" to refer to Union troops says nothing about slavery. It's just florid 19th century prose. That's how even common people wrote and spoke. Yet, the author of this article sees even this commonplace form of expression through the lens of slavery. He/she's showing their hand, and bias.

3)  Standing up to death--or dying-- for a different interpretation of the Declaration, and Constitution, is worth pride. My ancestors fighting for their home, and family-- of which, yes, slaves were considered a part, even for generations after abolition-- is absolutely worth pride.   You can dislike, or be confused, at the notion that a person could be considered family, and a slave. But that's how many people then (slave and free), my family included, saw it. I do not believe slavery to be moral. I'm glad it's gone. But I also understnad that history is not the practice of blanket condemnation, or an attempt to oversimplify complexities to provide ourselves a sense of moral superiority. Our responsibility is to understand the people of the past by their standards, not to hate them on the basis of ours. To do so is as ignorant as calling the Aztec Empire ""savages"" or ""uncivilized"" for the practice of human sacrifice, while ignoring why they believed what they did...to say nothing of their other achievements.",1583211355,fjc8a1a

Jesus dude. You know they bought, sold, beat and raped these people, right? Sentences like this make you sound like a history revisionist. You are demonstrating a very warped idea of what slavery was, and this is all pretty standard revisionist stuff. 

The idea that slaves were just ""part of the family"" is some racist modern bullshit to justify the atrocities of our forefathers. 

They were never like family. They were slaves. And if they ever thought they were like family, it was only because they were manipulated and hurt until they lost the will to fight.

Point is it's definitely about slavery and not much else. The fact that these people fly the flag without looking into the history of how shit poor whites were looked at is amusing. If your ancestors didn't own slaves, they were nothing but pawn for rich slave owners. 

It's just the rich fucking over the poor and getting the poor to really hate black people on a whole other level. The stupidity of the ""heritage"" crowd is incredible.

7116,7116,ilikehockeyandguitar,"We've been here in Tucson almost a month! I ended up getting a new vehicle prior to our move (2015 Kia Sorento), and it was great the whole way there and pulled the 6x12 pretty well.

We did exactly the route we planned. (Erie-Nashville, Nashville-Dallas, Dallas-Roswell, Roswell-Tucson) It was long, and I drove the whole thing myself in 4 days. The Nashville - Dallas stretch was without a doubt the longest part of it. At this point, remembering the whole trip in it's entirety is kinda tough, there was just so much to process. We stayed in three motels, and used GrubHub two nights because we were two tired and lazy to haul the uhaul around to get food after we made it to our hotel.

Pulling the trailer had me at between 55-60 the whole way honestly, which was pretty tough through the bigger cities- there obviously was a ton of cars and trucks passing me like crazy. Driving with the trailer back there wasn't as bad as I thought, but it definitely lets you know it's back there. It did hurt my gas mileage quite a bit, but I also kept a close eye on my RPM's and even my engine temp just to be sure I was clear. I made sure I checked all my lights every morning before we left the hotel and hit the road.

As for the city driving, Dallas/Fort Worth was the most stressful out of all the traffic and driving, as we drove through rush hour and all sorts of lane changes. That said, it's a really pretty city.

Also, there were tons of stretches through New Mexico en route to Roswell that were just dark (it was night at the time) and without any type of gas station, store, town, etc. Planning your bathroom trips and gas is essential. Even after we left Roswell, there were some long stretches of NM that had zero cellphone service- luckily that was during the day though.

Are you implying that the soldiers who fought in that war, were doing so for a reason other than their states wanting to preserve the institution of slavery? I‚Äôm not talking about the individual soldiers here, I‚Äôm taking about the clashing of the nations. The Union went to war with the Confederacy in response to the South Carolina Militia attacking Fort Sumter and the secession of the state of South Carolina which in it‚Äôs own declaration when seceding said:

‚ÄúA geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery‚Äù

Furthermore when seceding Mississippi said: 

‚ÄúOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery. [...]There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.‚Äù

Georgia, when seceding states this:

‚ÄúThe people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.‚Äù

While you may say that the individual soldiers may not have been fighting for the cause of slavery, you‚Äôre ignoring the fact that the the war and that flag only existed because the South wanted to hold onto the institution of slavery. Had the South not been the aggressors in the war, attacking Fort Sumter and then seceding, those men would not have had to fight a war. You can make arguments for states‚Äô rights or economic pressure, all you want, but what the Confederacy was advocating for was the right to maintain an economic system based on slavery.",1583242782,fjd0tfn

1) yes, I'm talking about individual soldiers, as well as brqoder political forces. That's because I want a complex understanding of history that doesn't efface the common soldiers, and doesn't reduce the discussion to uselessly broad strokes. 

2) you're cherry picking in your choices of sources. You're only quoting what suits your argument, rather than taking into account other parts/reasons in the same documents, or more than three states. You're doing the same thing in your last paragraph, as well. ""The south were the aggressors"" is an oversimplification that equates Beauregard's actions at Sumter, with the motivations of the entire south. That's not an argument, it's a mischaracterization that serves your purposes. 

3) ""the flag only existed..."" is another oversimplified reading. Are you familiar with how the battle flag came to be? With what it meant to all the people willing to be killed to keep it from being captured? The flag was far more often associated with the army that fought under it by people back then, not with slavery. You associate it with slavery-- but that's your bias, not an interpretation based on primary sources.",1583267314,fje8wv7

Just the fossil creek area near there (mostly before it got popular and started requiring permits to keep track of unprepared hikers but I digress). We‚Äôve done some loops in the superstitions (last one went up near Charlebois from the Peralta trail head) and I‚Äôve done havasupai a couple times now. Grew up outside in general though mostly car camping and 4-wheeling. 

I‚Äôd say toughest we‚Äôve done has been a 13mi day with some ups and downs in elevation maybe. I don‚Äôt keep track of exact mileage very well though. 

I‚Äôm thinking I might do a day hike before our planned weekend to get a lay of the land. Wasn‚Äôt thinking of doing it fully thru, especially after hearing about how slow going it tends to be and we only want to do one night. I was thinking More like doing an out and back but I‚Äôm not sure how far we can go in from one side or the other before we have to commit to a full on swim rather than just wading. 

Also not sure which side is better to go in at (bull pen vs trail 17?) but I‚Äôve been working on reading personal blogs out there to get an idea. There‚Äôs a lot of contradictory information out there though! Ideally we‚Äôd like to do around 4 mi each day (4mi or so in and camp?) but would be happy to do around 10 as long as we don‚Äôt sleep in too much...but I know that‚Äôs not what this hike is going to be like.",1583268158,fjeafi8

Keeping somebody enslaved is not how you ever treat somebody that you have dignity or respect for. I don't try to look at the past through a contemporary lens. I understand that there are horrific things in every family, But to try to pretend like you can keep somebody in slavery and also consider them a part of your family... it's a massive leap of understanding that I cannot possibly follow you on. That takes a level of sociopathic callousness that I cannot begin to imagine. 

The only way you can keep somebody in slavery is if you think that they are less human than you. To think that somebody is so similar to you that you and they are like family and then to also sell their family members, or their children, force them to work for the rest of their lives, buy and sell their future generations, and threaten death if they ever leave you...

As another person said, make sure all tubs/sinks have water run every month. For instance an unused tub they might come up the drain.

Usually a perimeter does it and helps all that.

Side note: Also keep areas around your house clear of debris/brush/leaves etc, even the rock/dirt/grass line should leave about 6 inches around your house.  There are subterranean termites everywhere in the Southwest about 6 feet down.  If water in one spot ever breaches that they come up and chew into any wood/seals/cardboard etc.  When it rains they tend to come up but it is spread widely so you don't want anything around your house.  Any concentrated water areas they will notice. Always check your house line around your house every month or so for mud tunnels especially after wet times or any water issues. Perimeters or traps help with that as well. At least we don't have wood termites which live in the house, subterranean enter the houses they have tunnels in at night and leave by morning so they are easier to take out, they need wetness and wet mud to live.

7552,7552,ItsOkayItsOfficial,"Not at all! In the past 10 years just about every city -on all levels- in the US has gone through some kind of downtown ""boom"" to cater to this millennial desire for a ""work, live, play"" urban experience. KC, DC, Denver, SLC; you name it. PHX is WAY behind that, it's downtown as recently as 2019 having been deacribed as a ""series of interconnected parking lots"". But it is FINALLY starting to catch up, and thanks to those parking lots is going to boom very very quickl, which I believe we're seeing. 

Not sure what your metric for ""a while"" is but I moved to the valley from downtown DC 5 years ago and DT PHX was definitely not on my radar, whereas in DC as early as 2010 people were running to get into places like U St or AdMo, akin to our Roosevelt Row/Churchill Evans.

Toward pay; the incentives are there already!  I'm a software engineer and (adjusted for cost-of-living) in PHX I make on-par with everywhere else outside of SF and Seattle. And I work for a very large, stodgy, non-tech company. My partner works for a unicorn ride-share company in DT PHX in a non-tech role and makes well above what the role pays elsewhere, BEFORE CoLA!

Going one-step further what we pay in rent for our beautiful, central, 1200 sq ft, right-next-to-a-national-university-campus, loft apartment  (with a garage!!!) is the same as what we were paying for the same setup in S Chandler. It would only get us an 800 sq ft studio in DC, if we got lucky!

As I type this I'm listening to the airy sounds of people filtering over to the Saturday public market and the distant ""ding ding"" of the light rail blocks away and it's AWESOME :) I don't think there is another downtown in the US I could have this for these prices, and certainly not a top 10 city.

The local downtown improvements in Gilbert, Chandler, Phoenix, etc and nationally in similar downtown or lower end areas are overall good, but also the revenues from these areas won't be seen in taxes for some time for better or worse.

The only real downside is sometime rents go up as areas gentrify and push out residents and it skews business to one area of town where other areas might depress a bit due to less investment because of lowered tax investments elsewhere. For instance some areas of cities will receive less investment and focus by the city in favor of the areas that are more hot due to less taxes, but also less revenues for the city.

Opportunity Zones were mainly [created to help low income areas and people, but ultimately it is helping real estate developers and large commercial projects](https://kjzz.org/content/686609/analyst-opportunity-zones-may-not-provide-desired-opportunities).

First up, pictures and sunsets and all that are something Arizonans love. So it‚Äôd be a tough sell to say something that people genuinely like should be banned entirely.

Second, this sub is what people make it out to be. We‚Äôve tried chat posts, discussion threads, and all sorts of thigns, but none have clicked.  We could try it again now the sub has grown, but there‚Äôs only so much the mods can do.

What posts have YOU personally made here that fit the things you would like to see? What if you committed to making one post like that a week.  Then we get 10 or so other people to do the same thing and we‚Äôd have lots of other good content.

It's appropriate to love hikes &amp; sunsets- the landscape is amazing &amp; sunsets are so good they made the state flag. I make it a point to go outside and enjoy them often.

I don't think people need to be making posts to be engaged in a sub. I'm new to Arizona and am inclined to listen more than speak. Quality over quantity. Low effort posts like dogs on hikes and smartphone snaps of sunrises in mirrors clog the works.

I appreciate you engaging. My post was intended to work just as r/UnpopularOpinion posts do: to express something that contradicts with prevailing themes or norms.

r/arizona and r/phoenix have quite a bit of good content, but the signal:noise ratio gets skewed often by a number of lower-effort posts (including memes, particularly in the summer -- yes, it's hot, we get it). 

That being said, I also prefer to interact by commenting versus posting. This is true in all of the subreddits in which I participate.

7650,7650,jmoriarty,"The issue with ""I don't think people need to be making posts to be engaged in a sub"" is that it translates into ""I want someone else to do the work."" 

Subs are the sum of all the interactions - contributors, commentors, mods, etc. It looks like you've submitted one post here ever, about two months ago. You mention you're fairly new to Arizona, so why not posts about things you've done, places you've eaten, things you learned about people here, tips for new people moving, favorite local music you've discovered, best source of local news, favorite local people to follow on Twitter/IG/etc, and on and on?

So yeah, we get a lot of pictures here, but they also get a fair number of upvotes. People _like them_. There is a lot of space for other content, but I'd challenge you to start contributing it yourself. Be part of what you want to see.

And you're always welcome to voice opinions here, popular or not. I'm a big fan of open discussion, and think it's how people and things (inc this sub) improve.",1583694802,fjye08h

7652,7652,jmoriarty,"I don't disagree, I just think it's challenging, especially in geographic subs, to find that balance. Yeah, I don't care for the heat memes either, but people talk about that in real life, so should we not allow it here? And for people who just moved here, it's new to them.

We split the difference by imposing some caps. We limit memes that are totally generic, but allow some if they are clearly made FOR AZ and not just anywhere that's hot. We allow sunset pictures, but require people put the location and information in the title, and limit to one per day (that actually has cut down on them a LOT). But judging on the upvotes, people like them.

As for the last bit, I get that a lot of people prefer to interact via commenting. Rule of thumb is 90% of a community are lurkers, 9% interact/comment, and 1% make content. 

But there are 50,000 people here. If just 1% - that's it - ONE PERCENT of people here made one post a MONTH, we would have over 16 new posts every day. Just that little interaction by a tiny percentage would be a big change.

So while I honestly hear you - there are many communities I value where I'm much more of a lurker than here - I will never NOT challenge people to step when this topic comes up. The more people rely on ""someone else"" to make the posts, the less likely this is to ever change.",1583695344,fjyf0z7

A as a landscape photographer who happens to love our state and loves sharing it's beauty with people who only think ""AZ is all brown and dead and full of tumbleweeds and cactus"", I'm totally guilty of posting more pics than anything else here. I've also taken and shared many an amazing sunset taken on my cell, because that's what I had handy at the time. Those usually do wind up on IG or some other small format media where the limitations of the equipment don't matter or the audience isn't as... discerning... as we re here on reddit.

When I do post here (and it isn't often that I'm proud enough of something to share it) I try to comment on where/when it was taken, so that if someone comes along and wants to learn more about that place, they've got some basics to look it up. 

Many towns and places in our state live and die on tourism dollars, and tourism is driven more by visual aides than by reading a description. Think about it this way. Would you rather look at pics of Havasu falls, or read about them? If I can contribute and help bring money here and put it into our economy by taking a couple photos and talking about where they were taken at, I'm happy to do so. I'm taking pics no matter what, so it's not like I'm putting in a lot of extra effort.

Edit: Actually I know where this conversation is going to go, So lets end it early. The only law on the books that google can find in AZ is this one. https://codes.findlaw.com/az/title-13-criminal-code/az-rev-st-sect-13-3019.html

Which is all about taking illicit photos of people unknowingly while in public. Nothing about Photography in general. 

So I HAVE looked it up. I'm calling your bluff. You CAN take photos all you want here as long as your not violating some other law like trespass. 

Further http://downtownphoenixjournal.com/2009/04/02/photography-crime-phoenix/

&gt;Perhaps the reason the officer had so much difficulty in citing a statute that forbids the photographing of things as innocuous as a light pole, is because none exists. What it appears the officer was referring to was a joint FBI and Department of Homeland Security memo dated August 3, 2004, that requests local agencies ‚Äúreport information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF).‚Äù

8082,8082,UGetOffMyLawn,"Globe is mostly Caucasian of blended descent from either the mid-west to the south of the US and have been in the area for multiple generations or multiple generational from Eastern European countries, Hispanic multi-generational families from Mexico and Native America most from Arizona tribal families but some from tribes in surrounding states.

There are African Americans and they do just fine but note that the most elderly of the community can be well...  You won't be discriminated anywhere you go but you may get ""a look"" or called ""boy"" now and again.  Just know that this is not a big city but they do have a rather vocal lgbt community and that has helped change some views.

You will often hear the area referred to as Globe/Miami or Miami/Globe as they are essentially the same with no real demarcation line between the two cities except a smaller area known as Claypool which most who don't live there don't even know is there.

The main business is the mines.  The area is boom or bust depending on what is going on at the mines and it has been this way since the 1940's or so.  Same with many of our mining towns.

I am from this area.  I know it extensively.  I own in this area.  I am one of the multi-generational families who have lived/worked/first came to the area before Arizona was a state.

It is a beautiful area but admittedly there isn't a lot to do outside of outdoor activities, drinking and fucking.  The drug and crime issue has become rather prominent in the last 10 years.  It has really begun to ravage the people and area like most small towns across America.

Neither Phoenix or Tucson are far enough away that a day drive for errands is out of the question.  It is done all the time.  Even for a special night out, concert or the like.  Otherwise you have a few grocery stores or 1 Walmart.  Also a casino if you're into that sorta thing.

There are issues with all law enforcement agencies in the area with the exception of AZDPS.  Be careful.  This is a long standing issue.

There are also environment issues with the area.  DDT (Agent Orange) testing was done in the Pinal mountain range during the Vietnam era and the effects are still not 100% known to those who live in the area.  Those who lived in the area during certain time frames (many years ago) are classified as Downwinders with the Department of Justice if they have now or have had (even deceased) from certain types of cancer caused by nuclear fallout from the testing done in Nevada.  I have multiple family members that have died as a result of being Downwinders.

The water has also always been a concern due to the mines as well as the air due to the tailings (which are undergoing reclamation now).  The area has always been a cancer hot spot and many many people who live here get cancer and die at much higher rates than the general population.

Unless it is your dream job or the pay is something you just can't pass up I wouldn't recommend living in the area.  If you really need the position consider taking it but living on the far Eastern edges of Mesa or Apache Junction and making the commute.  I know people who live in Globe/Miami and commute to Phoenix each day for work.  It can be done.

I think it seems most people here don't seem interested in content like people having discussions about less Arizoniany stuff. I'd be interested to see what this place looked like if that was going on. But for that to happen, the rules would have to loosen up, or a new community would have to be created.

I will address your concerns publicly though since this is seemingly what you want. 

* You were answered in modmail with the following response (nothing more and nothing less): ‚ÄúYour post reads like a classified ad. You've never posted to the sub before, so it reads like spam as well.‚Äù 

* You never replied further to discuss with us but instead made this post. 

* Your post after reviewing it myself is really suitable for the Tucson sub at best and/or the Tucson classifieds sub. Not here. It also does appear to read somewhat self promotional or come off as spam for a first time post.  What another sub/moderation team does is not applicable here.  

* We have basic guidelines on our sidebar which also contain a link to our full sub rules. These have been there for years. 

* We have a weekly chat and eats discussion post pinned at the top of the sub as an announcement. 

To clarify a few additional things for everyone. This is NOT just a picture posting sub. Our sub is about All things Arizonan, from the Grand Canyon to Yuma and all places in between.
Sharing of regional news and interests the rest of the state may not hear about is especially encouraged.  This may include pictures.",1583911854,fk6qmg6

8151,8151,UGetOffMyLawn,"This is a teachable moment and we can work with this. 

You are new to Reddit. So in general most moderators are kind and helpful in modmail if you tell us you are new or need help understanding something. Some of us have spent hours teaching people how to use Reddit. 

Hell, there are a bunch of non-mods that do this very thing!

The point of modmail is so that when some mods are away with their family, going to concerts, working or doing whatever the other mods can see what actions and communication transpired and pick up if needed. When you communicate outside of modmail for sub specific items you get into the blame game. All you needed to do was reply to the last message you received. 

Generally a lot mods do not like receiving private messages. Some even have the ability to receive them completely turned off.  

You will find that checking for a subs rules, reading and understanding them before trying to call a sub out is preferable. Also, spend some time commenting in existing threads and posts to get a feel for the sub maybe for awhile. Ask questions, ask the mods or regular users on things you aren‚Äôt sure of. 

Last but not least. Reddit can be brutal. Some moderators can be downright pure evil for the fun of it. If you take things hard or have a difficult time with critical words towards you or your thoughts you may want to really reconsider your time on Reddit. I mean that with all sincerity and the best intentions.",1583914227,fk6shfa

8158,8158,AZ_moderator,"Another mod already covered most of this, but just to be clear since I was the one who removed your post:

* Your post was a long effort to get people to work with you on something you wanted. That sort of thing reads very much like a classified ad or a Looking For sort of post.  
* That would have been okay if you had been some sort of contributor here before, but you weren't. You had never posted in this sub before from what I can tell. Not once. The first time you showed up was to post your classified ad.  
* Reddit's guidelines on this (and ours) are if you post mostly about your own stuff and never anything else, that's a self-promotion spam guideline. That's fairly well established here. 
* You did NOT reply to anyone else in mail last night. I replied to your modmail, then your next post was here. You did not reply in modmail to ask for clarification or if there was a way to make it work. You also did not PM me, as I just checked my messages. 

There's at least a half-dozen ways you could've handled this, from actually contributing to the community before making your post, to understanding Reddit's rules a bit better, to actually having a conversation with the mods asking for help or clarification. You didn't do any of those.

If we were really the power trippers you thought we would've deleted this thread this morning rather than try to explain. You just don't care for the explanation, which is a different issue.

But I am curious about that screenshot, because there is no reply from you. I'm hoping you didn't send it to AutoModerator (which is what posted the removal comment on your post) as that's an unmanned bot account and not a mod.",1583944964,fk7wkvb

Dr. Osterholm confirmed how children are getting infected, but they don't get sick. We know how quickly kids can spread this disease, especially given that a) they don't show symptoms and b) they can't effectively practice social distancing. Not closing schools will essentially allow COVID-19 to proliferate at a rate even more exponential than it currently is, especially given the **severe** lack of testing. But closing schools can help slow this down. One particular study showed that doing so [reduces the cumulative infection rate by about 25% and delay the peak of the epidemic by about 2 weeks](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04795). And that was for a *moderately* transmissible pathogen, like influenza. 

Delaying the peak is **absolutely essential** to [flattening the curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/) of infections, specifically *for* those nurses (and doctors) who have children. Once our hospitals are completely overwhelmed, there will be no choice but to close schools and by then it will be too late. We are living in difficult times. Many have and will lose their jobs, go bankrupt. The fact that we don't currently have a proper solution to where the children of these nurses go is awful. Unfortunately, leaving schools open will only make the pandemic worse. The US is not prepared.

8710,8710,LilyLove84,"Thank you. I 100% agree. Stop posting these sensationalist headlines. All they did was pull some random stat and use that to create this absurd headline in an attempt to scare everyone. 

You can use these models or stats to tell whatever narrative your trying to accomplish. For example, if we look at the overall China cases, based on that model there were approximately 80,000 cases out of a population of 1.3 billion. Which is an infected rate of 
.00006 (0.006%). If you take that number and apply it to our current AZ population that would actually only be approximately 420 people infected. Hell.... if you say every case of infection is located entirely in the city of Wuhan China which has a population of 11,000,000, then that would be an infected rate of .7%. That would equal 49,000 infected people in AZ. 

This article is just trying to create a panic, and is actually proposing we'd have a higher infection rate than the epicenter of the entire crisis in Wuhan China.

People who post articles like this cause panic for nothing more than karma. And, I compare these people to the people who are currently out buying 10x more toilet paper than they need.

Got turned down because two of them grabbed water and it was 1 water per household. A bit upsetting because we could have grabbed a 42 count water bottle case and had it count as 1 instead of just 1 jug and had it count the same. But they rock, paper scissors it and the loser grabbed a soda from the cooler in the line.

Companies like Apple have already closed their retail doors, and we should be beyond grateful the retail/grocery workers/food service workers who have chosen (or been forced financially) to come to work and interact with all of us.

Having done a number of them for over half
my life, these jobs do not often offer much to feel happy about.  Think about the feelings of the human in front of you when you approach them and ask for their help.

Nobody should be yelled at or for goodness sake touched by a customer while they are providing a very necessary service, even with the impact of this selfish and potentially dangerous hoarding trend.

A gentleman at a smaller grocery chain shared with me (as he was anxiously trying to make it through the last couple customers of his shift) that he had worked back to back 12 hour shifts due to the increased demand and had only slept 2 hours all day.  

He did this of course for his income, but the result is that he helped to keep food and other necessities available for our community‚Äî because his company did not offer enough paid leave to substitute for lost income if the store closed down due to the virus, or if he should happen to contract it himself from one of his customers and miss work.

Think of the human being in front of you and remember we all have at least one thing in common ‚Äî we are all in this together.

The good news is the test coming soon does not use the same chemicals. 

They are running out of the current ones as the test used thus far is a research only test so it has a low demand during normal times being only used by research labs.

9546,9546,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Maria Polletta:*  


Gov. Doug Ducey on Thursday announced he would limit restaurant service and close bars, theaters and gyms in counties with confirmed cases of COVID-19, stepping up Arizona's efforts to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.¬†

The directive will take effect upon close of business Friday. It applies to six Arizona counties: Maricopa, which had 22 cases as of Thursday; Pinal, which had 10; Pima, which had seven; Navajo, which had three; Coconino, which had one; and Graham, which had one.¬†

The Republican leader also:

* Called on the¬†National Guard to help grocery stores and food banks restock¬†shelves to protect food supplies.
* Halted all elective surgeries ""to free up medical resources and maintain the capacity for hospitals and providers to continue offering vital services.""
* Delayed expiration dates for Arizona drivers licenses, so that residents who are 65 or older don't need to wait in line at state offices to renew them.
* Authorized restaurants to deliver alcoholic beverages alongside food, and allowed manufacturers, wholesalers and¬†retailers to buy back unopened products from restaurants, bars and clubs.

No potatoes, no onions, no apples, no bananas... I could spend literally all day listing off everything we are out of because it's all gone! Don't even get me started on toilet paper and kleenex!

People here are really starting to freak out, we can't get basic food staples anymore, and with the supply trucks for the stores as backed up as they are, who knows when we will get restocked.  Lots of us are rational people and we didn't panic buy, and now we are screwed because everything is gone.

People from Kearny/Hayden/Winklemen who rely on our stores as well are now having to drive all the way to the valley or to Tucson just for a regular shopping trip.

9844,9844,DR-SATAN_MD,"I was less talking about quarantine and more talking about the general public's response to what's going on. I haven't been able to buy toilet paper, water, etc for almost 3 weeks now and no one understands why anyone is doing this. I asked a lady why she was buying 8 gallons of milk, and she just said quarantine. I asked her how long she thought the milk would keep for, and she didn't even give it any thought before heading to the counter. 

I suppose I could have made it more clear  but I support the quarantine and all the closures. I think the public is reacting in a strange way and that it's highly disproportionate to what's actually happening. Everybody heard the word quarantine and tuned everything else out. All the essential places will remain open, and I think everyone should be spending their time trying to figure out how to pay their bills if they get laid off or even fired by the smaller by businesses that may not recover from something like this. Everyone's blowing all their money making sure no ones else gets anything at the store, not considering that they may not be able to work for much longer and the money will stop. 

And the misinformation is what kills me! There's all these people out there that fancy themselves epidemiologists spouting all this bullshit and not even trying to use common sense! My boss cranked the heater in the whole building to 80¬∞ this week because the dumbest employee he has told him that the virus will die in temps exceeding 75¬∞. Even half a second of thought should tell you that if that were the case, no one would be getting sick because the average body temp for humans is 98.6. Australia is currently in triple-digits and people are still being infected. Nobody is even trying to use their brains about this whole thing! And what really bugs me is the fact that my boss is a chemical engineer, having spent years studying and earning degrees in chemistry, which usually requires a couple courses in biology.

My boss also stated that if the quarantine happens, anyone who wants to keep working can, and that he's boarding up all the doors and windows in the building and taking the upstairs over with his guns so he can wait for someone to come and try to make him leave. I know it's all talk, but that kind of attitude pisses me off. When I asked what his real plan was, he said he still expects people to come to work unless they're  sick.

Hell, even the trump administration is bracing for this to last up to 18 months and result in serious supply shortages for things far more important than toilet paper. Y2K never had anything like this. Virtually all the big fears of that were entirely unfounded and even if they weren't, the issue was exceedingly easy to address with essentially zero government intervention. Hell, by the time December of 99 rolled around it was already considered a joke. Compare that to today when even right now in the middle of this *the experts* are sounding the alarm.

Saying this is in the same vein as Y2K is like saying a gentle breeze is in the same vein as a hurricane. Sure, you can find some similarities on the surface, but the differences - from the root causes to the direct and indirect effects - are orders of magnitude apart.",1584808475,fl48wo3

9861,9861,hairofthedutchboy,"They are aware. Communication still happens. Inmates are some of the most vulnerable to this and many other health isdues due to the amount of exposure in the ways they are housed. All jails have probably went on lockdown (should have by March 16, if not earlier), meaning all are in their cells and out for shower, exercise, and visits (via video) for an hour (max) per day. The problem jails face is cleaning as they are horrendous at it until something happens. However, they have a huge (inmate) population to pull from to do those tasks. Their lack of normal cleaning procedures mean it was highly likely present in the facility and probably spread quite rampantly before lockdown and before symptoms. Our jails have faced these types of problems many times, for many years, in many forms. They can handle it. They just need to handle it every day,  not just after the fact.",1584809246,fl4a6h1

Cholla (and opuntias, which are closely related) grow in easily-detached sections so they can get caught onto passing animals. They're not really trying to kill the animal, it's just an opportunity to spread themselves and grow new offsets across a large area, which increases their chance of survival.

10177,10177,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Amanda Morris:*

The University of Arizona [said Monday](https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/amid-shortage-covid19-collection-kits-uarizona-scientists-race-make-more)¬†that researchers had produced 1,600 additional COVID-19¬†test kits over the weekend and that the university's [Health Sciences Biorepository](https://deptmedicine.arizona.edu/divisions/translational-and-regenerative-medicine/core-facilities/uahs-biorepository) had secured materials needed to make an additional 7,000 test kits this week.

The additional tests come amid a significant shortage of kits nationally that has¬†limited the ability to test patients for the virus.

The kits contain two materials needed to collect specimens from patients for testing.¬†One is the swab used to collect samples from a person's nose or throat and the other is¬†ingredients that stabilize the virus until samples can be tested -- otherwise known as a testing medium.¬†Both¬†have been in short supply.

The second part ‚Äîthe testing medium ‚Äî was created using a formula provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [according to a university press release](https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/amid-shortage-covid19-collection-kits-uarizona-scientists-race-make-more).

""Fortunately, our personnel at the Biorepository have several decades of experience in creating biospecimen collection kits for use in FDA-approved analyses and clinical applications,"" Biorepository Director¬†David Harris said in the press release.

Using this formula, researchers initially manufactured five liters of the substance, which was enough for 1,600 test kits. In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/SteveVoeller) on Monday morning, Steve Voeller, the university's vice president of government and community relations, wrote that the test kits would be used to help supply the university's campus health service, Banner Health and the Pima County Health Department.¬†",1585004775,flbhke5

10249,10249,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Ryan Randazzo:* 

Nearly 30,000 people filed for jobless benefits in Arizona for the first time last week, causing the state-run website to crash Friday as approximately eight times the number of applicants from the prior week rushed to apply.

The figures are not surprising considering the widespread shutdown of businesses, both voluntary and government directed, to combat the spread of the¬†coronavirus.

An Arizona State University economist [last week said claims are likely to rise for weeks,](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2020/03/19/arizona-unemployment-benefits-how-apply-claims-rise/2875839001/) as they already had in states like Nevada and Washington that saw the business impact of shutdowns before Arizona.

A Department of Economic Security spokeswoman said Friday that the website where people who apply for those benefits ""experienced systems errors today as a result of the increased volume in unemployment applications.""

DES expanded the system capacity to fix the problem, said Tasya Peterson, communications director for DES.

""The Arizona Department of Economic Security is committed to doing everything it can to provide services to those in critical need of services during this time,"" Peterson said. ""The department is continually monitoring performance and adjusting as necessary.""

Arizonans who are put out of work through no fault of their own can qualify for a maximum of $240 a week for 26 weeks through the Department of Economic Security. An [executive order from Gov. Doug Ducey last week expanded those offerings](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2020/03/20/ducey-extends-arizona-jobless-benefits-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2889888001/) to people affected by the pandemic.",1585016791,flc0als

As new coronavirus cases climb in Arizona, the state is¬†directing agency leaders not to independently inform state employees about positive COVID-19 tests in their departments, according to internal emails shared with The Arizona Republic.

The state also isn't stopping employees exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 from coming to work unless they have symptoms, the emails show ‚Äî despite evidence that individuals can spread¬†the disease before or without becoming symptomatic.

10440,10440,Fit_Bicycle,"PHOENIX‚Å† (3TV/CBS 5) --¬†Governor Doug Ducey has issued an executive order delaying the enforcement of eviction action orders for renters impacted by COVID-19.
The order applies to renters who are quarantining due to COVID-19 or are facing economic hardship as a result of the outbreak. It will remain in effect for 120 days.

‚ÄúNobody should be forced out of their home because of COVID-19,‚Äù said Governor Ducey. ‚ÄúThis order is about protecting public health and providing relief to families impacted by this virus ‚Äî whether through sickness or economic hardship. This is the right thing to do to support Arizona families during their time of need and prevent the spread of COVID-19.""

Tuesday's order aligns with recent federal actions. On March 18, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a suspension of all evictions for HUD-financed properties. On the same day, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to suspend foreclosures and evictions for at least 60 days due to the coronavirus national emergency.

The Arizona Department of Housing offers assistance to Arizonans struggling to make mortgage payments. Through the Department‚Äôs ‚ÄúSave Our Home AZ‚Äù (SOHAZ) program, Arizonans may qualify for:

Principal Reduction Assistance

Monthly Mortgage Subsidy Assistance for under and unemployed Arizonans

Second Lien Elimination Assistance

View the executive order¬†HERE.

SOHAZ Program questions may be directed to the Arizona Department of Housing, Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. ‚Äì 5:00 p.m. by calling (602) 771-1000 or by¬†going online.
View information on the SOHAZ program¬†HERE.
The Arizona Department of Housing also operates a toll-free hotline staffed with housing counselors to answer questions about housing in Arizona. To reach a housing counselor toll free, Arizonans can call: 1-877-448-1211.",1585090030,flerg3f

10448,10448,Skaderator,"PHOENIX ‚Äî Arizona's governor issued an executive order on Monday that will make cities, towns, and counties coordinate and be consistent with advice from the state's health department.

The executive order states, ""any order restricting persons from leaving their home due to the COVID-19 public health emergency issued by a county, city, or town shall be consistent with advice from the Arizona Department of Health Services."" It went on to say that, ""any such restrictions shall be coordinated with the State prior to issuance.""
FULL COVERAGE: Coronavirus in Arizona
This comes nearly a week after cities such as Phoenix and Tucson ordered closures of bars and restaurants before a statewide mandate was implemented.

In a press conference, Governor Doug Ducey, issued an executive order that detailed what is considered essential services. The governor said he did this in order to provide the citizens, employees, and families across the state with this information.

""We are not implementing a so-called shelter in place policy as other states have done,"" Governor Ducey said. ""This is a proactive and administrative measure that ensures the state has one consistent, overarching policy that is based on CDC and public health guidance.""

When reporters asked what's in the executive order, he said it would be coming out, but would not indicate more, but said ""it's to provide clarity.""
""We of course looked at CDC recommendations, public health, and we are watching what's happening around the country,"" Governor Ducey said.
The language in the executive order will make cities coordinate any efforts to place their own ""stay at home"" orders.
ABC15 asked the governor's office if a city were to come to them and request a ""stay at home"" order, would they allow it.
A spokesperson for his office said they would not comment on hypotheticals.
In a press release, the governor listed all the essential services.
* Health care and public health operations, including hospitals, public health entities, distributors of personal protective equipment and biotechnology companies;
* Human services operations, including those that provide services for the elderly, those with developmental disabilities, foster and adoption children and the homeless;
* Infrastructure operations, including food production, utility operators, construction and internet providers;
* Government functions, including first responders, emergency management personnel, 911 operators, child protection staff, welfare providers and more;
* Business operations, including grocery and medicine providers, outdoor recreation;
* Organizations that provide charitable and social services, including religious and secular non-profit organizations and food banks;
* Media organizations, including newspaper, television, radio and other media services;
* Gas stations and other transportation-related businesses;
* Financial institutions, including banks and credit unions;
* Hardware and supply stores;
* Critical trades, including plumbers, electricians, cleaning, sanitation, HVAC and security staff;
* Mail, post, shipping and logistics;
* Education institutions, including public and private K-12 schools, universities and research entities;
* Laundry services;
* Restaurants for consumption off-premises;
* Supplies distributors that enable telework and work from home and those that supply essential businesses;
* Transportation, including airlines, taxis, and ride-sharing;
* Home-based and care services, including for seniors and those with developmental disabilities;
* Residential facilities and shelters, including those for children, seniors or at-risk populations;
* Professional services, including legal, real estate and accounting services;
* Day care centers for employees exempted though the order;
* Manufacturers, distribution and producers of supply chain-critical products;
* Hotels and motels;
* And funeral services.
Some essential businesses listed in the executive order include personal hygiene services with additional sanitization procedures, golf courses, and pawnbrokers.",1585090582,flese1c

On March 19, California¬†Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all 40 million people in the state to shelter in place¬†as health officials battle the new coronavirus. Two days later, Illinois Gov.¬†J. B. Pritzker ordered his state's 12.7 million residents to also shelter in place.

Since then, millions of people across at least 20¬†states¬†have been given orders to shelter in place, restricting them from leaving their homes except to go to work if they can't work from home, get food or see a doctor.
But Arizona, with a population of seven million,¬†isn't one of them.¬†
Gov. Doug Ducey¬†has said we're ""not there yet.""¬†
If Ducey were to call for a shelter-in-place order, it could limit Arizona residents'¬†liberties even more, some lawyers say. But during a pandemic, some of them also argue, the law is tipped in favor of public health.
Ducey has issued an executive order closing businesses such as bars, gyms and theatres and limiting restaurants to takeout. Through the order, police have the authority to issue misdemeanor citations to anyone who purposely defies it.
Ducey has also declared a state of emergency,[¬†which¬†gives the state's executive office power to quarantine people](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00624.htm). This¬†means if a person defies a doctor's orders to stay isolated, either at home or at a hospital until they recover, then state officials can seek a court order to force them to stay isolated.
So far, people with the coronavirus have voluntarily self-quarantined and there has been no indication that Ducey plans to use the courts to forcefully isolate someone.

As a public service, The Arizona Republic is offering all coverage of the pandemic free of charge.¬†[Support The Republic by subscribing to azcentral.com.](https://fullaccess.azcentral.com/newstart/specialoffer?gps-source=CPDIGARTICLE&amp;utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=article&amp;utm_campaign=DIGITALARTICLE&amp;utm_content=CPDIGARTICLE%22)

'What¬†you're seeing now is nothing unusual'

James G. Hodge, Jr., director of Arizona State University‚Äôs Center for Public Health and Law, said quarantine laws and a governor's health-related orders aren't meant to punish people but to protect the health of the public.
The reason why other states have gone further than Arizona by calling for a shelter-in-place is¬†the virus can easily be spread and a lot of people don't show symptoms,¬†Hodge, Jr., said.
He added that Ducey could at some point call for a shelter-in-place order because there is a compelling legal argument to make that the public's health is more important than temporarily inhibiting people's liberty.
""Your civil liberties to engage in regular behaviors that could impact the health of others would definitely be curtailed for a brief period of time,"" he said. ""Those civil liberties have always been counterbalanced with the need to protect the public's health. Whatyou're¬†seeing now is nothing unusual.""

Quarantine vs. shelter-in-place

Under Arizona law, quarantine could be ordered for¬†people who have been infected by the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.¬†
Ducey's¬†[March 11 emergency declaration](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/03/11/ducey-declares-health-emergency-arizona-new-coronavirus/5025505002/)¬†gave the Governor's Office power¬†to medicate, isolate and quarantine people, if necessary, with the help of law enforcement or the National Guard.
The law also says a state health official may require someone to quarantine or isolate themselves if it's an emergency. But the law requires the state Health Department to seek court approval within 10 days for the quarantine order to remain in effect.
A person who has been ordered¬†by health officials to quarantine¬†could appeal to the court and the state could¬†provide an attorney for that person if they can't afford one.
If the person is quarantined under court order,¬†the state would also have to provide¬†food and shelter if the person doesn't¬†have a place to stay.
A shelter-in-place order differs because it would apply to everyone, regardless of whether they are infected with the virus or not.
If Ducey does issue such an order, it's expected that it would be similar to what other states have implemented. This¬†includes closing businesses that are not part of the governor's list, forbidding residents from gathering in large public spaces and asking people to stay¬†inside their homes.¬†
Most states' orders have some exceptions for when people can leave their homes, such as to go to the grocery store or to work, to see a doctor or to walk their dog.¬†
""If you want to go outside and participate in any walking activities that don't involve socializing with others directly, there's no real risk to anyone,"" Hodge, Jr., said. ""Now, if you go out with 20 friends and you're at a nightclub, they'll break that up.""

How would an order be enforced?

Steve Serbalik, an attorney who represents police officers, said¬†the quarantine laws are clear on who can be sequestered and what steps the state must take to¬†isolate a person.
He said the quarantine laws also give¬†due process to people even during this pandemic, which is much different than an¬†emergency shelter-in-place order that requires people to stay at home for an undefined period of time¬†without access to a process to challenge the order.
He said nobody yet knows which side the courts may fall on when considering personal liberties versus public health during a pandemic.
""Unless someone is arrested or until someone is cited, you can't challenge it in court,"" he said. ""So it's an open question right now.""
Benjamin Taylor, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix, said that police and state health offices have a right to enforce a governor's emergency health order or quarantine laws but says he doesn't expect a ""draconian"" approach because it would be counterproductive.
""No local law enforcement agency would likely compound its problems by throwing a quarantine scofflaw with a deadly communicable disease in among its jail population,"" he said. ""Local authorities often have some form of enforcement power, but usually try gentle persuasion to persuade people that it is for their good and the good of the community.""
Jocquese Blackwell, a Phoenix attorney, said that if the police needed to quarantine or enforce the governor's orders, it would be unlikely to do it on a large scale because there aren't enough resources.
""Unless the state is going to provide lawyers and food for everyone, I don't see how they can do it,"" he said.¬†

Education over arrest

Under Arizona law, police can cite people with a class-one misdemeanor for deliberately defying a mayor's or governor's health emergency order.
But most of the police departments The Republic reached out to said they are taking an educational approach, reminding business owners that if they are not part of Ducey's or their respective mayor's essential business list then they must close.

10916,10916,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Ronald J. Hansen:*

Arizona still has so few coronavirus test kits that state officials are warning that screening could end, Rep. Greg Stanton said in a Thursday letter to Vice President Mike Pence.¬†

Stanton, a freshman Democrat from Arizona, continued to take the Trump administration to task, saying it continued to ""grossly mismanage"" the crisis and had ""crippled"" doctors and nurses with a lack of needed supplies.

""The lack of test kits continues to have real consequences across the country, including in Arizona,""¬†Stanton wrote. ""Just yesterday, the Arizona Department of Health Services Director informed doctors across the state that they are discouraged from testing individuals for COVID-19 because there are ‚Äònot enough available supplies to meet testing demand.‚Äô This is a direct result of this Administration‚Äôs failures.""¬†

State officials said testing ""may be slowed or even halted due to the uncertainty that supplies would be replenished,"" Stanton continued.

A Pence spokeswoman referred The Arizona Republic's¬†inquiries to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.¬†

On Feb. 28, [Stanton wrote to Pence, whom President Donald Trump named to head the nation's response to the coronavirus, to complain that Arizona had received test kits that were defective](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/02/29/new-coronavirus-test-kits-maricopa-county-received-defective-says-rep-greg-stanton/4911655002/). He asked for answers to a series of issues stemming from that.

On Thursday, Stanton noted that he still had not heard from the vice president.

Stanton wrote that health officials have said doctors ""should treat those with respiratory conditions as if they have coronavirus, regardless if they test positive.""

That leaves everyone still ""in the dark"" about the spread of the virus, he said.",1585273063,flm2hrg

The health official leading Arizona's new coronavirus response is urging primary care providers not to test most patients for¬†COVID-19, saying the state's ""current reality"" is that it doesn't have enough supplies to meet testing demand.¬†

In a set of [new guidelines issued Wednesday](https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-diseases-services/coronavirus/primary-care-preparedness-covid-19.pdf), Health Department Director Dr. Cara Christ said providers ""should consider removing this diagnostic 'tool'¬†from their toolbox and managing patients with respiratory conditions as if they have COVID-19.""

""Keep working with your commercial vendors for testing, but do not depend on having test results for your management,"" Christ wrote. ""There is no specific treatment or management strategy (for COVID-19), and results should not change clinical management.""

Given a shortage of personal protective equipment, Christ also advised¬†health care professionals to move testing outdoors, if possible, and to reuse equipment. Going outdoors could help¬†limit the exposure of¬†staff and other patients, she wrote.

She encouraged doctors to send patients with more severe symptoms to ""higher levels of care"" but noted: ""There may not be testing indicated or available at the higher level of facility, either.""",1585275741,flm6izb

Didn't see a whole lot of Hispanic friends or coworkers in NM head down to see relatives in Mexico for the holidays or family functions.  All of their family was a town or two over down the road.  

So this created Mexican cuisine and culture that is not at all like it is in Arizona.  Or in other cases the Hispanics and Anglos had been mixing for so long that the cultures blended.  Remember going into a cowboy bar in New Mexico and seeing Hispanic rednecks drinking beer, chewing tobacco and hanging out with their Anglo friends and everyone getting along.

Arizona is more politically conservative, though this could be changing soon. AZ has a GOP-led state government and has one Democratic Senator. NM has two democratic senators and a democrat-controlled state government (for now, it swings).

AZ is, from my readings in average temperatures per month, just generally hotter. It‚Äôs definitely got hotter summers, and it has more sunshine as a whole. 

Arizona has more ecosystems in comparison to New Mexico, though as others have said, New Mexico has more ‚Äúgreen‚Äù.

Arizona borders California, Nevada, Utah, Mexico and New Mexico. I‚Äôve actually stood at the Colorado River border with Cali. New Mexico borders Arizona, Texas, Colorado, and Oklahoma at the northeastern tip, as well as having a small border with Mexico. 

In terms of demographics, New Mexico has a Hispanic majority of the population, though again this is a much smaller populace as a whole. Arizona is mostly white but has about 30% of the populace who are Hispanic. 

New Mexico has a much higher crime rate and a much worse score on education. AZ‚Äôs economy is significantly stronger than NM‚Äôs, and this is likely to get even more significant as more young professionals are moving out to AZ. As I intend to as well. 

Arizona has a slightly lower median age of 37.9, while New Mexico has an average age of 38.1. Many people see AZ as a state of retirees but actually both states are younger than average as a whole. 

Both have a significant Hispanic presence.

(...)

Of the $4.2 billion Arizona may receive, about $1.6 billion would go to the state government, according to the estimate.¬†

Local governments could see about $1.3 billion in funding. Entities with populations of more than 500,000 ‚Äî such as Maricopa and Pima counties and the cities of Phoenix, Tucson and Mesa ‚Äî may receive cash directly versus through the state.¬†

Taxpayers below certain income thresholds will receive one-time, direct payments as well.¬†

Single individuals who reported an adjusted gross income of less than¬†$75,000 on tax filings for last year will receive $1,200. Couples filing jointly will receive a $2,400 if they made less than $150,000 jointly. Parents and guardians will get¬†another¬†$500 per child.

These direct payments are separate from weekly unemployment benefits, [which will jump from $240 to $840](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2020/03/26/arizona-unemployment-benefits-could-increase-600-claims-break-record/5083518002/) with the addition of federal aid.

My personal assumption is that things will be permanently changed, but it will not take our culture long to adapt, and after a few months, again, things *will* be different, but they will be stable. People will go back to having certainty of their needs being met, and civil unrest will be minimal.

I have three metrics that would convince me that civil unrest is imminent:

 * Water infrastructure shuts down
 * Communication infrastructure shuts down
 * Energy grid shuts down

If any of these three happen, I am going where people are not.

To be prepared for this I have inventoried my camping gear, have been filling water containers, and have my vehicle packed and ready to go.

The moment we lose any one of those services, I'm going camping for two weeks, and then checking back in from time to time.

The more people who are prepared to do this, the less severe it will be.

Again, I don't expect this to happen, and I doubt it will, but preparation seems prudent in the face of uncertainty.

Senator Lindsay Graham (chosen because he is a high-profile Republican, not for any other reason) approaches a military commander and proposes another coup.

And secondly, your scenario is Graham approaching a general. You think any general would listen to Graham? Really? I have more respect for them than that. They are intelligent.

11764,11764,Pollymath,"I actually think Prescott will be a really affordable place to live in 10-20 years when all these rich boomers start dying off. They call it the ""Silver Tsunami"", over the course of the next decade, something like 920,000 homes per year will be freed up. Some cities may see as high as 30% of the homes being put on the market per year will be sold by Boomers 60+. 

Think of it this way: right now, for people who actually work, Prescott seems entirely geared towards the home market of retired Californians. Tons of housing in price brackets suitable for people with equity, but not a ton of good paying jobs. Not overly diverse job markets, either. Old folks are tightwads, so wages are suppressed. 

As Boomers grow older, they will be replaced by Generation X, but Gen Xers do not have the same amount of financial resources as the Boomer generation does. They will likely stay closer to where ever there kids (Millennials) end up, which is likely closer to home. If those Gen Xers do move, they might still have 10 years left before retirement. They'll want jobs too. Over time, Prescott will stop growing specifically for snowbirds, and start growing more for a more diverse economy. When it does, all those Boomers, and those who inherit their homes, will likely be selling places cheap.

When we look at places that have cheap living, they usually had an oversupply of housing. A lot of east coast and midwest cities are like this. Pittsburgh is a great example. Huge housing boom to supply workers to steel industries that dried up after 50 years, leaving the city full of housing options. No western city has ever been in this position because for the last 50 years, most western cities were growing due to the need for more workers. Prescott is growing simply as a retirement area, not because it offers great jobs. It's not the Bay Area or Southern California, Seattle or Portland. It's primary populace is old people, and old people don't last forever.",1585609789,flyv8tk

https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/487489-worst-case-coronavirus-models-show-massive-us-toll 

&gt; One model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that **between 160 million and 210 million Americans could contract the disease** over as long as a year. Based on mortality data and current hospital capacity, the number of deaths under the CDC's scenarios ranged from 200,000 to as many as 1.7 million

**I have no idea how they came up with a number** ***as low*** **as 1,700,000 deaths, for their** for their ***maximum***.

The number of infected from the CDC's **Best Case Scenario** are **half the country**. So lets pretend that, in the next year and a half, until a vaccine is in place, only half the population gets infected. That's 163,000,000 people.

And let's also pretend that our hospitals never become over-run, and we can (and will) take care of everyone who gets infected, so we can have a mortality rate of the country with the best current outcomes, South Korea, which has a 0.6% mortality rate.

0.6% * 163,000,000 = 978,000. EASILY more than all the wars of the 20th century combined. 

That is 6th grade math, using absurdly unrealistic numbers. The number 1,600,000 deaths which they gave for ""worst case scenario,"" is what you get if you take their **lowest estimate of eventual cases**, and assume the mortality rate will only be 1%. That should be treated like the best case scenario **mimnimum**. 

Let's look at their worst case scenario infection totals, an absurdly low 2/3 of the population, 210,000,000. 

Let's use another absurdly optimistic mortality rate, 1.5%, on that infection total: **3,150,000 dead.** 

And we're probably looking at a more realistic eventual mortality rate between 2% and 3%. **Between 4,200,000, and 6,300,000 people will die.** 

And that's if only 210,000,00 people out of 327,000,000 people, only 2/3, get infected.

This isn't alarmism. It's 6th grade math performed on official number projections.

If you want to say it is wrong, you have to either give a reason why you think the healthcare system won't be over-run, and we'll be able to maintain the best possible mortality rate, and why you think a lower number of people will become infected.",1585618006,flz8peo

11947,11947,itsnotmythrowaway1,"Have you not been watching the news?

Covid-19 is climbing at an exponential rate and it‚Äôs going to overwhelm hospitals nationwide.

We have no cure right now, and it puts young people on ventilators and straight kills the elderly.

Schools have lots of elderly teachers and staff, and they are a melting pot of children living in a variety of conditions, coming in sick and spreading their illnesses to others. Thousands of children congregate in schools, in lunch rooms, in halls and classes and playgrounds. 

They‚Äôll bring home anything they catch to their families... and bring anything their families catch to the school.

Right now there‚Äôs no guarantee that we will find a cure for this disease anytime soon. Everyone is talking 1-2 years for a vaccine... and a miracle drug might not appear any sooner. Given the death rate and intubation rate this disease is pushing, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine closures going another year.

There‚Äôs no guarantee that this disease is seasonal, so the deaths might not stop anytime soon.

Even if it is seasonal, without STRONG quarantine practices and everyone wearing masks, it will hang on in some parts of the country and in the Southern Hemisphere, and could come roaring back next year. Back during Spanish flu, it went away in the summer and came back in the fall/winter... killing fifty million people.

If things continue on the trajectory we‚Äôre on, we might be looking at literally millions of dead THIS YEAR. If that happens, schools aren‚Äôt opening back up for the next school year. I‚Äôm in virtual meetings with staff every day. We already have two staff members sick. One is waiting on results from a covid test right now. Covid-19 would absolutely devastate schools and families if we threw the doors open.

Be optimistic of course... but go look at the worldometer graphs for covid-19. They‚Äôre straight up exponential graphs. Now go take a drive over past the supermarket and look at everyone cramming in that parking lot walking in without a single mask on a single face.

This is going to get much worse. We‚Äôre just starting to wake up to how bad it is and people are still refusing to take basic precautions.",1585622688,flzfvcg

We had never lived in a van and it was really cool experiencing it for a week with the help of [BoHo Camper Vans](https://www.boho.life).

12195,12195,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Andrew Oxford (condensed):*

**Q: Can I still leave the house?**

**A:** Yes. Residents may leave their homes to participate in what the state calls ""essential functions."" The state has deemed grocery stores and many other businesses to be ""essential,"" for example, and those businesses can remain open for customers. Even restaurants and coffee shops may remain open for take-out service.

While the governor's order encourages Arizonans to stay home as much as possible, the governor also encouraged people who are not sick to get outside for exercise¬†like hiking or cycling, while keeping a distance from others and from crowds.

**Q: What are the ""essential"" services that can continue operating?**

**A:** Ducey issued a very long list of essential services last week. [It can be found here](https://azgovernor.gov/sites/default/files/eo_2021_0.pdf).

**Q: Do I need proof, like a note from my employer, that I am participating in an ""essential"" service or business?**

**A:** No, the order says ""no person shall be required to provide documentation or proof of their activities to justify their activities under this order.""

**Q: What is the penalty for violating the governor's order?**

**A:** The governor's order cites a law that would seem to make any violation a Class I misdemeanor. However, the order also says ""a person shall be notified and given an opportunity to comply"" before any enforcement.

**Q: Can I visit family members?**

**A:** The governor's order allows caring for family members and pets in other households by classifying these activities as essential. This includes giving transportation to a family member ""for essential health and safety activities and to obtain necessary supplies and services.""

**Q: How does Arizona's order compare to other states?**

**A:** At least 30 other states have adopted some sort of shelter in place or stay at home order. Many states have instituted tougher limits on which businesses and services can continue operating. California, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado have already shuttered barbershops and salons, for example. But those services can continue operating in Arizona.",1585690002,fm23m9r

12203,12203,jgalaviz14,"Where exactly do you get hundreds of thousands or millions dead from? We're not even at a million infected and not even at 50,000 dead worldwide. That's everywhere all over the world. The rate of infection is already starting to level off if you've bothered to see the rates over the last few weeks. It was exponentially rising in the US because we finally started testing people and getting symptomatic cases showing. Even so, the rate of recovery is higher than the rate of death amongst confirmed cases. The numbers will go up yes, but they are already leveling out worldwide because of the procedures and steps taken.

Look at this map by John's Hopkins, it's the most up to date and what most people are using to keep track daily. https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6. 

I'm not arguing it isnt serious or that the closure of schools now was bad. It is serious and we had to close schools for this semester. But I've been keeping track of the numbers each and every day at work and last week was a steep steep rise, while so far this week it hasnt been nearly as drastic. But to imply that hundreds of thousands to millions will die in the US *alone* is ridiculous and just buying into the fear mongering spreading worse than the virus. In the US we have about double the amount of recovered as we do dead. A 1.9% death rate amongst infected in the US, a 3.7% recovery rate. Of all cases around the world too studies have shown that about 80% of cases end up being symptomatic, so one can deduce that the death rate will go down even more to below 1% worldwide amongst JUST infected. You take the entire world population into account and those percentages become minuscule. So yes, children being left out of school for nearly a full year will have absolutely disastrous consequences for the education system and will stunt an entire generation for a year.

But the math is pretty frightening. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúgo back from millions‚Äù, I‚Äôm just pointing out that when Dr Fauci is saying hundreds of thousands dead. And that‚Äôs their ‚Äúif everyone acts perfectly‚Äù scenario.

The flu infects 1.1-1.5 people per person who gets it. That gives us 11-15 people who get the disease over ten ‚Äúgenerations‚Äù. 

And the flu still infects 5%-20% of the entire population.

This virus infects 2.5 people per person who gets it. Go ahead and multiply that out ten times. That works out to tens of thousands of people. 

Not eleven, not fifteen. Tens of thousands.

That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre shutting everything down and sacrificing the whole damn economy. This disease is frightfully contagious, and it kills far too many. They‚Äôre not doing this for fun. They‚Äôre doing it because they‚Äôve run the numbers. 

Now go look at the numbers. We‚Äôre approaching 200,000 cases. Most of those cases are open. Many are dying. We‚Äôre going to run out of ventilators very quickly - possibly too quickly to get manufacturing up to fix the shortfall. 

There‚Äôs a very good chance this virus infects far more than a typical flu. Even if the death rate is lower than it has proven to be.... its going to be horrific.

5% of the US is 16.5 million people, give or take. If the death rate is just 1%, you‚Äôre talking about 165,000 people dead.

If 30% of the population gets it, with a 1% death rate, that‚Äôs about a million dead.

If that death rate is even slightly higher, those numbers go up substantially.

Death rates of CLOSED cases are insanely high right now. But even if we ignore that and just do straight division... look at countries where this is well managed. Look at South Korea. Huge testing efforts, careful management... 1.6% death rate.

Death rates in even the best managed countries are above 1%, and we sure as hell aren‚Äôt the best managed here at home. 

I want to be absolutely wrong, but if this disease infects 20-70% of the population the way they expect, yes, the math indicates that millions of Americans will die. And in the process, it will overwhelm the system and kill plenty of people who -don‚Äôt- have the coronavirus right along with them.",1585700668,fm2moer

I'd wager the actual number is at least double that worldwide, if not more. Look at all the people who have recovered and the ones who never even showed symptoms and recovered. You can deduce that death rate to be way way lower than it actually is. The numbers wont ever be accurate unless you test literally every single person on earth which isnt possible. This virus has a very high infection rate but seemingly has a low death rate when you take those unconfirmed cases into account. Yes, even a 0.01% death rate worldwide is devastating at around 80 million, but I'd wager it does not get that high. It's just the fact that the rates are leveling out and have in some countries already, and the infection rates havent come out as apocalyptic. Sure it could all get worse, but things can always get worse. But chances are the reality will fall somewhere in the middle in between worst case and best case.",1585701452,fm2nxqk
12229,12229,itsnotmythrowaway1,"There is no sign of the exponential graph slowing down or flattening out yet. The deaths and new infections graphs are both straight exponential upward trending.

Maybe we slow this down, but if we don‚Äôt lock things down tight in that timeframe it‚Äôll come roaring back the second we open our doors. 

Globally, the numbers are flying straight off the hook. Even if we somehow contain it here, it‚Äôs going to decimate the world.

I certainly hope for the best, I‚Äôm just saying that millions of deaths isn‚Äôt exactly a worst case scenario. That‚Äôs the math on a rather contained infection with a low death rate. The best case scenarios still have a disturbing amount of people dead. The worst case scenarios are far more frightening...

You can wager what you like... but much like Vegas, I don‚Äôt think the math is in our favor.

And if the number of cases truly is double or more the confirmed number... that‚Äôs not good. That just means we‚Äôve got asymptomatic spread everywhere and it‚Äôs going to hit a larger percentage of the population. Tiny fractions equal insane amounts of dead.

- You leave the house for Home Depot where you'll spend the whole day interacting with others in a face to face retail setting. Your store carries *some* items that you personally feel may be essential or necessary, but you're selling the one item you consider the peak of frivolity; paint. You believe everyone should be at home, not Home Depot, but you're there all day every day and only for the money so that makes you holy and blameless giving you the moral high ground to criticize others, who:  

- Are laid off, furloughed, working remotely, or otherwise not engaged in their typical employment in an attempt to ""flatten the curve."" They come to the Home Depot one time, one day, to buy paint, so they can make productive use of their time in isolation by engaging in hours of solitary activity painting their house. Do they have the virus? Maybe, but they've been at home, not working retail, so they're much less likely than you to have it. Might they catch the virus while they're out? Absolutely! They'll go home, in isolation, where they'll feel like shit, get better or die, but probably not spread it beyond their household.  



And of course you've got to mention that you derive great passive aggressive pleasure from providing slow service because you're short staffed from coworkers staying home to utilize **extra paid sick days.** You could use those days yourself to stay home **with pay** until we either get a real stay at home order or it gets hot and the virus possibly dies off like SARS. (Note: I have read covid doesn't die off in the heat like SARS but even though it's a longshot I think that's really the only thing that could possibly slow the spread enough to stop our state from adopting stricter stay at home orders in the near future) So Tl;dr Everyone else should stay home, you could even get paid to stay home, but you're going to work anyway so you can look down your nose at others.",1585719127,fm3cm8y

This sure seems like a golden opportunity for a tactful and diplomatic person (I genuinely hope you can fake these qualities for 10 minutes) to open a dialogue with management about public health concerns and the relative nonessential nature of your work at the paint desk, closed out with an open ended question about occupational safety and health like ""what can Home Depot do to keep me safe at work?"" and a workmans comp question along the lines of ""we still don't know much about long term outcomes from this disease; what will Home Depot do for me if I am infected at work and potentially face lifelong complications requiring extensive lifelong medical care and leaving me unable to support myself?"" Hey, guess what, you'll go home on sick leave and get a call or letter in a few days about never standing at that paint desk again.

12420,12420,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Catherine Reagor:*

Rent is due for most metro Phoenix renters at the first of the month, but a growing number likely are struggling to pay due to the health and economic fallout from COVID-19.

A record¬†number of [Arizonans have applied for unemployment¬†benefits](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2020/04/01/larger-unemployment-payments-coming-soon-arizona-officials-say-coronavirus/5100109002/)¬†as businesses have shuttered or scaled back operations to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.

If you are a struggling renter, help is available in a few ways:

* Arizona's new [rental assistance fund](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/27/ducey-announces-5-million-rental-assistance-during-coronavirus/2930296001/).¬†
* [A move to stall evictions for at least a few months](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/real-estate/catherine-reagor/2020/03/27/how-duceys-az-eviction-delay-work-renters-hurt-covid-19/2917164001/)
* Federal incentives for landlords.

But first, housing advocates advise you should tell your¬†landlord or property manager about your situation.

Tenants concerned about paying their rent need¬†to contact their on-site manager, lease agent or landlord by phone or email right away to let them know if they need rental assistance or a payment plan, according the Arizona Department of Housing.

\---

The state housing department¬†[launched the Rental Assistance Prevention Program](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/27/ducey-announces-5-million-rental-assistance-during-coronavirus/2930296001/) on March 30 with $5 million in funding. Arizona renters can fill out applications to get help paying rent at [housing.az.gov](https://housing.az.gov/).

Don't wait¬†because evictions typically move fast in Arizona, often within three weeks.¬†

Recent action by Gov. Doug Ducey could help on that front. The governor ordered a¬†120-day delay on¬†the enforcement of evictions¬†for Arizona renters impacted by COVID-19 because they are sick, can‚Äôt work or lost jobs.¬†

Here‚Äôs who qualifies to delay evictions:

* A renter required to be quarantined because they have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
* A renter ordered by a licensed medical professional to self-quarantine based on symptoms defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
* A renter required to be quarantined because someone in their home has been diagnosed with COVID-19.
* A renter demonstrating a health condition that puts them at risk for¬†coronavirus, according to the CDC.¬†
* A renter suffering a substantial loss of income resulting from COVID-19 due to any of the following¬†reasons: job loss, reduction in compensation, closure of place of employment or a need to be absent from work to care for a home-bound school-age child.",1585769813,fm5bfao

12423,12423,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Maria Polletta:*

Gov. Doug Ducey on Wednesday asked President Trump to formally declare a ""major disaster"" in Arizona, a move that could mean more federal cash¬†for the¬†state's pandemic response efforts.

Arizona already is set to [receive an estimated $4.2 billion in aid from the national stimulus package adopted Friday](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-bill-arizona-get-federal-government-cares-act/2931665001/). While that measure is broadly geared toward reviving the economy, the major disaster declaration would¬†specifically support¬†disaster-response efforts implemented by state and local governments.

**LETTER:**¬†[Read Ducey's letter to President Donald Trump](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6823600-FEMA-Request.html)

If the president approves Ducey's request, funding would come from the¬†Federal Emergency Management Agency.¬†According to the Governor's Office, it would help:

* Expand¬†crisis counseling for front-line workers.
* Supplement work being done by tribal health care professionals.
* Provide grants ""to reduce the risk of loss of life or property during future emergencies.""
* Make¬†disaster-related legal assistance available to low-income residents.
* Expand food assistance and other services to low-income households.",1585770815,fm5dcr8

12442,12442,QuadrumanousCuddler,"I apologize, and take full responsibility for not understanding. I'm not being deliberately obtuse, i'm just not that smart. My own knowledge and understanding is highly tailored to my own life and influenced by my own past experiences and the nature of ignorance itself dictates that I can't know how much or what I don't know, and my biggest blind spot is the the range and extent of my own blind spots. Please, allow me to summarize as simply as possible what I believe I understand and what I do not understand, so that we may have a meeting of the minds.  

**I Understand:**  

- There is a global pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in at least 100 years. We have no vaccine, no direct treatment, limited testing, limited capacity to care for hundreds of thousands of sick patients at one time, and the only chance we have to save lives is to slow the spread through isolation until we can effectively address the virus itself.

- Some products and services are essential to support our survival as a species. Individuals and businesses engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of these products or who provide these services are therefore unable to isolate and must continue their work so that others may survive. 

- Your employer has declared themselves essential because they retail (by your estimation) a few essential products, but mostly retail frivolous consumer goods which are not essential. 

- You get in the door under the pretense that you are selling essential products, but by your own admission you personally do not sell any essential products. You instead deem your work essential because it's more comfortable to earn a paycheck than not, and this justifies leaving your home and interacting face to face with people all day and makes you the good guy.  

**What I Don't Understand:** 

- Your customers get in the door under the pretense that they are buying essential products, but they're only buying your nonessential items. They instead only deem their shopping essential because it's more comfortable for them to buy paint than not, **but they're wrong** and they think it justifies leaving their home and interacting face to face with people **but they're wrong** and that makes them the bad guy.  

- How are your actions any different than theirs? Why are they responsible for frivolous retail exposure, but you, the retailer on the other side of their transaction, *not responsible* for the exact same frivolous retail exposure? 

If any of my understandings are incorrect, please correct them. If you have some explanation for the things I don't understand, please share it.",1585779178,fm5sopv

In fact I hope they do wind up shutting down those parts. Like I said, I need money and that would suck BUT I would and do understand why things are shutting down. 

If you paid attention to what I've been saying, you'd see I am all for everything non essential shutting down but I don't make the rules and I'm not Ducey. Just common sense that some things literally don't matter like paint, or garden supplies besides maybe fruits and vegetables. I'd argue I'm in the least essential part of the store besides cashiers at this point. There's no reason to buy paint. But paint wasn't even my main point. 

Shouldn't be buying or going out to buy anything that's not essential. AZ is going to get slammed and this is a reason why: people going out and buying dumb shit. Just today 27 people were found to be infected at a Tucson nursing home.

This truly is a tough call that is turning into political points depending on how you lean. The balance in my opinion is finding the best way to get people to comply and not create panic. Again, just my opinion, the more restrictive the government tries to be the more people will push back causing ripple affects. Also factor in the more control government takes the less they want to give back. Factor in economic casualties that will feed into the pushback causing more control concerns. Imagine they say full on shelter in place and make people have to have papers to travel to their ‚Äúessential‚Äù service.  The group against that concept will likely start testing response from government and it would take just one bad response there to create yet another movement. I would say its a combined effort in the end both on government to set reasonable guidelines and us to follow and go beyond as the situation dictates. To that point both have failed to a degree.

I hear you, but the entire country isn't Waco, Texas. 

Shelter in place is [already having an effect in WA, CA, etc](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/new-data-shows-social-distancing-stay-at-home-orders-may-be-factor-in-slowing-spread-of-virus-81460805783). Are there massive revolts there? No. Sheltering in place/stay at home orders are not ever going to be a solider-at-your-door order in this country, and there will always be spread with a pandemic because you can't keep 100% of people inside their homes; **sheltering in place/stay at home orders are about flattening the curve, and not necessarily about extincting the virus**. 

&gt;Also factor in the more control government takes the less they want to give back

So the government wants us to shelter in place forever so we don't go out and spend our money? [They want to indefinitely stifle consumer spending that was propping up the economy in the first place](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-consumers/strong-consumer-spending-propping-up-u-s-economy-idUSKCN1VK1JW)? Not a chance.

I can never bring myself to do it tho. I know how much people rely on me and we gotta get those groceries to the floor for the people who are in need.

12789,12789,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Catherine Reagor:* 

Arizona will get nearly¬†$51¬†million¬†in Department of Housing and Urban Development funding to help low-income families and others hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The federal housing department is doling out $3 billion in total across the country.

Nearly two-thirds of the money, according to HUD, would¬†go to:

* Build medical facilities for testing and treatment.
* Acquire hotels for COVID-19 victims to recover in.
* Transform¬†other buildings into clinics or treatment centers.
* Support businesses manufacturing medical supplies.
* Build group living facilities¬†to centralize patients undergoing treatment.
* Train health care workers.

The other third would¬†go to:

* Build or operate emergency shelters for the homeless.
* Provide hotel vouchers to homeless families.
* Provide childcare, education, health care and employment help to the homeless.
* Prevent people from losing their homes.

Arizona‚Äôs share is split between¬†17¬†municipalities, mostly in metro Phoenix, three counties and the state. The city of Phoenix will receive the most ‚Äî about $15 million.

The $3 billion in funding, part of of the [Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act passed by Congress](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/03/27/arizonas-house-members-back-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-andy-biggs-paul-gosar-ruben-gallego/2925124001/) last week, will be given to communities quickly, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",1585871919,fm9mpmy

Turns out I‚Äôm the guy in the photo.
After getting all this news I‚Äôm am sitting on my couch 6 days later thinking I wonder if I made it to reddit. Turns out I did! Anyways she said yes! I proposed as you can see. On Monday my fianc√© comes into the bedroom early showing me that we were on the news as her friend texted her showing the link to the news clip. Same day we reached out to thank the Photographer N. Robb and she sent us this photo. I could not thank her enough for taking this beautiful photo as I wanted one from this angel but what you all can‚Äôt see is my brother is actually in the shadows taking close ups. 
Anyways thank you all for your support.

Keep in mind, rattlesnakes don't want to bite people, they want to avoid being eaten. Their preferred strategy is to just stay hidden or slither away, and even if they feel cornered, they'd much rather rattle at you than risk a strike. As long as you don't literally step on one or shove your hand into one's hidey hole, the only way you'll get bitten is if you're actively fucking with one like a total moron.

We should all be on equal lockdown, only leaving the house the bare minimum to survive effectively as it's literally the only thing that works to stop the spread.

The projected numbers aren't dropping. We're simply now not testing people unless absolutely necessary. You can't make valid projections without testing. AZ is NOT doing better, we're simply ignoring it... going so far as to not tell people who worked in the same offices as positive cases that they've been in contact with such a person. Which is abhorrent. Hell look at all the idiot flooding the hiking trail to such a density that outdoor transmission is becoming likely, which is HARD to do.

And assuming that taking precautions = gloom and doom is asinine.

First of all people from Arizona are extremely selfish in comparison to my experience with Texans. 

BUT

Texans are more judgemental than Arizonians, in terms of how you look.

I feel like both are on a similar level as to how they view and treat the LGBTQ community. As another person pointed out though I think as long as your not being obnoxious Arizonians have a live let live attitude.

We are a 420 friendly state! Well medically anyways, it still can be difficult to find work even if you have your card though.

I have to say if I had any choice I would not be back in Arizona but Harvey destroyed my life and this is where my family is and they have helped me build back to where I am today. Returning to Phoenix has allowed me to find a new appreciation for my home state. The sunsets are unbeatable in beauty, I never realized how much I love being around mountains. While I do miss the green of Texas if you go to higher elevations it's possible to still see greenery in Arizona.

The heat is still utterly unbearable and as my family is able to become more self sufficient I have a feeling we will one day leave this state again. The heat is extremely difficult to handle for someone who has fibromyalgia it's so hard for my body to regulate my heat and I find it difficult on most days above 110 to do the bare minimum at work and not come home completely exhausted.

13186,13186,comisohigh,"A Plea from the Navajo Nation...from both Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribally run hospitals, of which there are only a handful serving an area the size of West Virginia... Please read.

Many are feeling alone on the Navajo Nation right now, especially in the remote community of Chilchenbito, which is essentially on lockdown due to the major outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.

As a public health physician living in this area for the past 8 years, I am part of the Epi Response Team, and have already witnessed the terrible impact this virus has had, and it‚Äôs only just the beginning. It is rapidly spreading to surrounding communities, mostly due to a multi-church gathering that occurred in Chilchenbito in early March, and the handful of emergency rooms on the Reservation are already overwhelmed with people presenting in respiratory distress. Many are being intubated, stabilized, and flown out to tertiary care centers scattered across AZ, NM, UT, and CO; but some are also dying at home or shortly after arrival to the ER, and not being tested at all because we don‚Äôt have a system in place for post-mortem testing. General testing is also not widespread, so the true numbers are grossly underestimated. Our tertiary care centers in the surrounding states are filling up fast - likely reaching capacity by next week - and we will have to keep these incredibly sick patients at our facilities on the Rez, without enough critical care nurses or PPE. We have smart doctors and nurses here and we are actively surge planning: designing respiratory care units in existing spaces and purchasing more ventilators (that are on back order), but it‚Äôs just not going to be enough.

I want to share why the Navajo Nation, is so incredibly vulnerable to this virus (and pretty much every communicable disease in existence):

The Navajo (Dine) people suffer from high rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and autoimmune conditions (to name a few), but this is only a small part of the story here.

Poverty - It‚Äôs hard to practice proper hand hygiene when there is no running water. Many have to haul water, but as the more physically mobile members of the family get sick, they are no longer able to do so. And many do not have the income to purchase soap, hand sanitizer, or even food... especially when they have to drive an hour to the closest store (if they have the money for gas) only to find that things are out of stock. USPS does not deliver to homes on the Rez, and many homes do not have a physical address where items can be delivered by even UPS or FedEx.

Overcrowding - When there are multiple generations, and perhaps multiple families, living in one small household, it‚Äôs hard to isolate those that are sick from those that are well. Entire households are falling ill.

Limitations of sheltering in place - related to overcrowding, if an entire household is sheltering in a small place, and unable to isolate those that are sick, and do not have the resources for proper hand hygiene and disinfection, it is easy for the virus to spread to everyone in the house. Additionally, it is difficult for these families to obtain things like groceries and other goods when they don‚Äôt have anyone that can safely leave the house...

Numbers - There are over 160,000 living on the Nation. There are only 28 ventilators on the entire Reservation. We need at least double this amount if the models/projections for this disease are correct. And that doesn‚Äôt take into account the number of medical professionals needed to take care of these critically ill patients: doctors and nurses that are continually getting exposed to the virus and being quarantined because they do not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE)

Access to information - When much of this community is comprised of elders that speak their traditional language and do not have a smartphone or social media, it is hard to disseminate information quickly to stay up to date... many households do not have land lines or television or even electricity. And when this information isn‚Äôt disseminated widely and effectively, many are uninformed and/or scared, many don‚Äôt know what to do if they or someone in their household develops symptoms, many don‚Äôt know to socially distance/isolate... traditional gatherings and ceremonies, including funerals, continue to take place... and spreading occurs.

Access to care - many live far from the health centers and don't have reliable transportation. Additionally, if there is a medical emergency in the home, often times EMS has difficulty reaching folks in a timely manner because of distance and/or unpaved, unmaintained roads.

Protection for healthcare workers - When the nearby health centers do not have enough PPE to safely see patients presenting to the hospital, let alone to perform vital home visits for assessments and face-to-face education, everyone is put at risk. The EMTs responding to 911 calls are also put at tremendous risk!

And here is some alarming data (as of March 31, 2020): There are 1289 positive cases in Arizona (24 deaths). There are 148 cases in Navajo Nation. Of the 148 cases, 49% of the cases are from Kayenta Service unit (KSU) and 16% from Chinle Service Unit (CSU). Kayenta Service Unit has been most impacted by the pandemic where almost half of the cases have required hospitalization (48%). About 50% of those hospitalized required ICU level of care (not included in this analysis, but extrapolated from reports from KSU and CSU emergency physicians transferring patients from the ER to tertiary care centers).

These numbers are really striking, especially since it points to the Navajo becoming quite ill (requiring hospitalization and ICU care) at higher rates than the general US. The Navajo Nation population represents about 2% of the Arizona state's population, yet Navajo positive COVID-19 cases are representing at least 11% of all Arizona cases at this time.

We are trying our best out here, but it is so incredibly difficult. Please be mindful of the challenges we face. But also be aware of the grassroots efforts by the local health centers, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, and the Navajo Nation to obtain and allocate resources (including food, water, soap, disinfectants, educational materials, etc) and to provide the best care possible. That being said, the Navajo Nation government and Indian Health Service Area Office doesn‚Äôt seem to have the infrastructure or organization to handle what is happening (and what is about to happen) at this kind of scale. Plus, it seems that these two entities are not communicating effectively with each other to truly determine what is needed ""on the ground."" President Nez is being proactive about reaching out to the state for any form of assistance, but the ""assistance"" we are receiving so far is not the most applicable.

The National Guard made press releases yesterday about how they set up a ""federal medical station"" in Chinle (my home) and how they are providing assistance to the Navajo Nation... but what they failed to share with the press is that they basically delivered a kit to set up a hurricane-like shelter (or, rather, camp) in an existing structure that is too far away from the hospital to serve as medical overflow, and only has a couple of restrooms, NO staff, and no essential medical supplies. Had they discussed any of this with the local IHS Hospital beforehand, they could have learned key things about the area and potential resources already in place to develop a better plan (which the local IHS has formulated), but again, communication between these entities has not been very straightforward.

I spoke with the National Guard and FEMA in Kayenta on March 30, 2020 about all of the above concerns, and the National Guard, pointblank to my face, said that they are ""spread too thin"" and that ""your hospitals need to focus on your ethics plan for rationing care."" Despite this answer, they are reportedly airlifting a bunch of PPE to the area soon üôè

We need more manpower, more communication between key entities, more critical care nurses, more PPE and other supplies, and more people who can get the word out and who will LISTEN and ACT. We need applicable solutions to face this crisis.

Sure, there have been funds from the stimulus package slated for the IHS and tribe, but this will take precious time to actually reach this area... and will likely get here after the worst has already occurred. Plus, the money is not worth a whole lot when vendors are out of stock of much needed supplies and we can't find nurses and other staff to pay.

Thank you for reading.

Yes. and no. AZDHS has only test a few hundred people. Almost ALL (nearly 100%) are positive. But even if that wasn't the case it wouldn't matter. You can't contact trace to break the chain of infection unless you test. This is the reason that China, Japan, Korea, &lt;insert any country that is doing significant test&gt; has a much better mortality rate than we do right now.

&gt;It's chicken little lemmings like you that caused a toilet paper shortage for a virus that doesn't make you shit.

Yes, me having my shit together in JANUARY and EARLY FEBRUARY is causing a shortage now... We haven't been shopping for anything except perishables (milk, eggs, etc.) in literally months. But I'm the reason for the short now... 3 months later. Get your head out of your ass and rub those brain cells together before you throw shade someone's way.

&gt;So millions were going to die, that's down to maybe 100k, which is about 1% of the infected. Please test everyone, so it can be .01% and be completely indiscernible from the deaths of the flu.

It's not. but considering that you think this is a flu, there's no point in arguing with you on this. You won't see the light until several of your family members die... and that's a shame. Every country has shown time and time again that this is SIGNIFICANTLY worse than the flu in every way. The most conservative estimates place this virus at 10x worse than flu... with the most speculative estimates saying 100-140x worse. I'm hedging that the real mortality rate is something like 1% or 1.2%. So nearly in line with the conservative estimates. Considering it's R0 values and the lack of action this country has taken that means that there will likely be 3.2 million dead and many many more millions permanently affected (lung fibrosis and heart damage). The ""only 100k"" death toll is if everyone listened and stayed the hell home. Except people like you aren't, instead you're too busy arguing in bad faith with people on reddit about something you clearly don't understand. Countries like China are having better times dealing (now) with this virus because the whole country is on lockdown.

&gt;And even more amusing, they are counting hospice patients in the death toll...you know what a hospice is right?

Prove this. Cause CDC isn't. Requires a death certification to make it to their list (reported from the hospital rosters). And the John Hopkins organization takes data from CDC in this instance.

I would even be okay if you counted hospice, SARS-COV2 has been shown to infect lungs and cause permanent damage. Potentially even the heart new research is showing. I would make a good argument that anyone in hospice who had a run-in with Covid-19 would likely be near death or forever impaired.  But that's right! fuck me for thinking about actually severely impacted people as a casualty of this virus.

Of those with the virus, half don't report any symptoms. Out of the half that do, over 20% require hospitalization. Of those, 5% die. If 16% of the population becomes infected (the same percentage the fed govt is using in their models) 5600 Arizonans will die. Without social distancing and stay-at-home orders that get ahead of the curve rather than respond to it, 40-50% of the population would likely get infected.

What's the lol for?

I'm not talking about Disney World

We're talking about the outdoors. One of the things that makes them great is that there's not a million people there.

If you've gone to a special place for years and then a bunch of people post pics and geotag the place for a bunch of internet strangers for validation and over the course of just a couple years you start to find trash and feces and more and more people there **how can that not degrade the place???**

How can that not negatively impact the experience of the place?

How can you not learn the obvious lesson that not all things need to be advertised like Coca Cola?

It's not about ""owning"" anything. It's about understanding that people can wreck things.

It's like if the Mona Lisa was just nailed to a tree out in the woods. You go there and enjoy the painting and leave. Someone else goes there and feels some compulsion to tell everyone what they saw then you have hundreds of people out there looking at it. Then you have people putting googly eyes on it and taking a crap next to it. Pretty soon someone realizes that you can't have something like that just out in the open. Because people wreck stuff. So they put it in a museum.

And then people like you get upset *""Who are you to take it and put it in a museum? Do you think you own it or something?""*

No, it's about recognizing that you can ruin something with too many people.


People DON'T respect places. People DON'T protect places. It's not a theory, it's something I've seen with my own eyes.


You can call my mindset selfish or whatever you want but I've seen places wrecked by over exposure since the advent of social media.

It's incredibly sad.


In my mind, it's the validation-hungry social media users that can't just enjoy places for themselves that are the selfish ones.


I've seen thousands of places that are beautiful and special. Having a thousand people there will destroy them. 

We now have a generation of outdoor users who get upset that someone won't spray location info all over the internet. 


If you want to be surrounded by more people, if you want there to be so many people at a place that you can't even enjoy it, stay in town.

And I haven't been outside in nearly two weeks. I put off getting my dental work done to slow the spread.

Maybe if we had mass testing, some of the hysteria would cease, but now that it looks to be endemic, I'm unsure of how AZ is prepared to handle that --- which, many have told me that we are not.

Public health officials have spent weeks telling Americans to stay at home.

Are Arizonans listening?

New data offer a glimpse of how traffic has thinned in Arizona amid the coronavirus pandemic and increasingly tough public health precautions to stop the disease.

Google has [released calculations based on its users](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Arizona_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) showing a sharp decline in activity around many of the places people typically spend time every day.

Activity around shopping centers, restaurants, cafes and movie theaters declined 40% in Arizona by March 29 when compared to the period from January 3 through February 6.

Activity declined 33% around workplaces, 41% around transit centers like bus and rail stops, and 17% at grocery stores and pharmacies when compared to the same period.

While Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order did not take effect until the evening of March 31, daily life had already changed¬†for many Arizonans as businesses shuttered or encouraged employees to work from home. Schools closed, too, and spring training was canceled.",1586129173,fmjfb8j

Commercial landlords must stop evicting small businesses that can't pay rent during the coronavirus pandemic,¬†Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey ordered Monday, a move entrepreneurs around the state have petitioned¬†for since shutdowns were ordered.

Commercial landlords are directed to cease evictions until May 31, and encouraged to defer rent, and waive fees and interest for late payments.

Hundreds of small businesses [around the state had signed a petition asking for a moratorium on evictions](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2020/03/25/coronavirus-relief-congress-may-not-do-enough-some-az-businesses-worry/2900547001/), saying they faced the very real consequence of going out of business because they couldn't pay rent.

‚ÄúArizona is grateful to the many landlords who are already working as good partners with small businesses during these challenging times,‚Äù Ducey said in his announcement. ‚ÄúThis order helps ensure¬†no small business or nonprofit will face eviction due to COVID-19 and¬†that landlords and small businesses work in partnership to make sure we get through this emergency together.""

The order affects companies with fewer than 500 employees.

Are we, as humans, part of, or apart from, the natural world? Surely our impact of stacking stones is no different from that of a beer upending them to find grubs, or a deer rubbing its shedding antlers on a tree.

Looking in from the outside recent years though it seems to be slipping.  South Main is decaying and there's lots of police activity now.  The nice neighborhoods from my childhood are starting to look dumpy.  And there doesn't seem to be much in the way of new development.

538,538,GreekFlamingos,"I grew up in and around Show Low in the '80s and '90s, moved to the big city in 2001.  My parents worked for the state, they moved up there in the mid-'70s.  For most of that time it was a town with two stop lights.

What was it like.  Hmm.  I'll start with the good.  The air was very clean, and the rolling hills with pine, juniper, oak, and manzanita were lovely.  A bit outside of town on a cold and clear moonless night the sky is unbelievable.  Being a young child the city felt like a bunch of buildings in the woods (today it feels more like a bunch of trees in a city); it was quiet, comparatively.  There were four seasons, things felt sane and routine, things felt more ""fixed"".  There was a high density of mental and emotional impressions such that a single place like the Dairy Queen or some bonfire pit by Fools Hollow Lake held a lot of memories for you, like it did for your siblings, and your friends and their siblings and their cousins, who all knew and went to school together.  There was a tangible if not unified sense of community, at least the fabric of one...it wasn't *too* small nor at the time too big, and it wasn't too isolated either, as there were other communities nearby and astride.  

As a kid you knew the geography of the whole town well; bike trail shortcuts, abandoned/haunted houses, mean old people who wouldn't give back your ball, that sort of stuff.  In the summer things got busy when all the flatlanders came up to visit and roost in their summer homes, and in winter they'd pass through on their way to Sunrise to ski.  July 4th parade and fireworks were a big deal, high school football season was a big deal, and you knew Xmas season was really coming to the mountain when the city would put the lighted decorations up and down the street lights of the Deuce of Clubs the week after Thanksgiving.

Now the bad.  Quiet desperation.  Your feet are cold and nothing changes and tomorrow will be very much like today; the safety of routine and psychological bubble that is a safe distance from the world informs you that you're missing out.  u/RebelRodeoChick is right in calling it a black hole, and we knew that if you were 18 and didn't go to college or join the military or otherwise achieve escape velocity you likely never would...so yes, it felt time and space were warped.  Some couldn't leave because they'd have had to give up their status as a big fish in a small pond. Boredom.  Disempowered people with too much time and no money under huge open skies - domestic abuse, substance abuse of all kinds - economic decline, general stagnation - and the same but worse on the rez's nearby.

The nature of the feeling of community I mentioned previously was heavily dependent on whether or not you belonged to a certain Church, whose members at least more or less...oversaw...a good deal of what happened in the city and the schools and so on.  I can't say that I myself felt especially excluded or disadvantaged by not being a member but it was the biggest club in town and whether or not you were in it could make a big difference, especially if you were trying to run a business.

People will often fawn about the White Mountains when I tell them that's where I'm from, and it's a great place to visit, even a fine place to live if you're retired or if you have a lot of money or can work remotely.  But the view from a homegrown 18 year old was very different - unless you were planning on putting a ring on the finger of your high school sweetheart and building the same life your parents had, there was really nothing there for you unless you stood to inherit your dad's concrete or gravel business.

Admittedly I do have a slow goal of getting some land up there in a quiet spot, maybe for a cabin or retirement or something.  I do miss the quiet but for the sound of the wind in the pines...",1586301211,fmqk5vx

Latter-day Saints have a strong sense of community and they rely heavily on each other for everything from jobs to babysitters.

It was a lovely little town called San Manuel that was maybe an hour drive Northeast of Tucson. It was really small, everyone knew everyone. There was a bunch of private property friends and I would explore, which was dumb because coyotes and every terrible insect know to man in this state lived there. We could play in the streets without fear of being hit by cars, since we could see everyone coming. The town was known for mining and my parents would here of parties they‚Äôd through in the mines. It was a nice little town, and of course we had our issues with drugs. 

I moved to Florence at around 11. The small little prison town, because obviously my parents worked at the prisons. Florence is very... unique? The town is split downtown, which consists of historic Florence and the prisons, and the uptown with the high school, housing, and a few restaurants. It wasn‚Äôt a major shift of moving, everything from San Manuel cane with me, it was just a matter of meeting new people and learning who lived in town. I‚Äôve seen the K-8 here go from a rundown looking building to being pristine. I‚Äôve seen the high school be remodeled slightly, and I‚Äôve even seen a few prison related events.

The coronavirus has taken many things from us, but it will not take our kegs.

Arizona-based Four Peaks¬†Brewing Company announced Wednesday that it will be selling discounted kegs, starting this weekend.¬†Draft beer has a limited shelf life, so with this sale, Four Peaks can sell more of their beer before it goes bad, and patrons in need of one to 124¬†large glasses of alcohol can have those needs met: A win-win.

""Rather than let the kegs we currently have in stock die a long, sad death, we want to get them into your hands. For cheap,"" an Instagram post announcing the deal said.

A half-barrel keg, the standard size, of any available beer is going for $100, down about 30%, and a sixth-barrel is going for $40. A half-barrel keg equates to about¬†124 pints or 16 oz. beers, and a sixth-barrel will get you 42 beers.

At the brewery's¬†8th Street location in Tempe starting Thursday¬†and then starting Friday at their Scottsdale pub, about 20 different beers will be available in kegs, including Kilt Lifter, Pitchfork, Hop Knot and A Wheat of Their Own.

Zach Fowle,¬†Communications Manager for¬†Four Peaks Brewing Company, recommends the Hazy, their newest IPA.

""It's one of those kind of cloudy New England style IPAs,"" he said. ""It's got this really nice tropical hop character, but soft bitterness. It's so drinkable and I've been drinking a lot of them in quarantine.""",1586466590,fmxkayi

He had never missed a day of work, so his job called SAR when he didn't show up to work the next day. The pilot was happy to see we were fine when we waved him down for a landing towards the end.  Wonder if you were there for it, a lot of volunteers meeted us at the end of the trail.  The guide we read said 4 days was all it took so we gave ourselves 5. Hiked/boulder hopped and swam sunrise to sunset every day straight for that one.  SAR made the guy change his trail guide online.

959,959,Pollymath,"Lets be honest, growing up in Cottonwood isn't like growing up in Sedona. I mean, yea, it's close, but its not like you went to Red Rock or Big Park. It has it's own school district, so I imagine you probably didn't have many friends during school that lived in Sedona while you lived in Cottonwood.

I only say this because I grew up in a little town in Pennsyvlania, and yea, other towns were 10 minutes away, but we went to different schools. It wasn't until highschool that I made friends with kids from other towns, and even then I didn't consider those ""my town"" even if I knew them well.

I hired a babysitter who grew up in Sedona. She loved all the new-age bullshit, but I was surprised out how ""not outdoorsy"" she was. I guess I kinda thought Sedona bred rock climbers and mountain bikers and extreme adventures, but its decidedly not like Whistler or even Boulder, where every kid is encouraged to take up some sort of extreme sport.",1586559732,fn1dgf5
960,960,Pollymath,"Yea Cottonwood is definitely more mixed in terms of incomes. Aside from old town, it doesn't really have a downtown, and Cottonwood is pretty spread out. Housing prices are probably cheapest in the area, but also limited jobs.

1155,1155,sunburn_on_the_brain,"Their winter home was up on the highlands above the canyon. However, the Havasupai have been living in the Grand Canyon - including Indian Garden - for hundreds of years. What happened to them was a travesty, but fortunately there were some moves towards restoring their lands; not in full, but they were able to get a lot of their land on the rim back. During much of the last century, they were told to stay in the canyon area around Supai, not allowed to go to winter homes on the rim or hunt deer. The government was trying to starve them out. It took decades and a lot of maneuvering in Congress, but in the 70s their reservation was expanded to 175,000 acres (from just a handful) and they gained control over the campground at the falls. There is still a lot that needs to be done for the tribe. Their school in the village has been an absolute hot mess for a long time, the worst in the BIA system. There is uranium mining outside the reservation that poses a threat to their water supply. There is a proposed massive village just outside GCNP that also threatens their water supply, not from contamination, but from draining the water table that feeds Havasu Creek. 

I have been to Indian Garden several times. You can‚Äôt just avoid that part if you want to visit GC, because they were for a long time kicked out of the entire canyon. And those of us out west, most of us live on land stolen from the Native American tribes. This was all done long before we - or our parents, or our grandparents - were born. Avoiding a single spot in millions of square miles that were also stolen doesn‚Äôt really do anything to help. Instead of that kind of a protest, they need help now. They need advocacy and they need the ability to live on their land. They need adequate funding. They need good schools. And health care. And protection against those who want their oil, gas and minerals without real compensation and safeguards. 

I would recommend the book ‚ÄúI Am The Grand Canyon‚Äù if you would like a history of the Havasupai.",1586710450,fn6zn6h

Embry Riddle is a great schoolgirl engineering and aeronautics... it's main campus is in Daytona Beach, Florida. 840 students at Prescott... not what I would call a major university.

It's good to remember that tons of people live in California and tons of non-residents also want to go to school there so you have the major UC system, major private universities, major liberal arts schools (think LMU or USD), and then all the small colleges too like Occidental. 

Arizona State, UofA, and NAU account for about 146,000 students in Arizona. If you include GCUs ""total student population"" which includes 67,000 online students, the total is over 228,000 students. In comparison, the entire UC system has 280,000 students.

So far as I know that hasn't been given out in Arizona yet, since the AZDES has been waiting on guidelines from the fed Dept of Labor. The guidelines came out a few days ago basically saying that if someone qualifies for even $1 unemployment from the state, they will get the extra $600 in full on top of that.

If your friends are experiencing significantly reduced hours they may still qualify for partial unemployment. That means entitlement to the additional $600 weekly per federal guidelines.

There‚Äôs tons of dog parks everywhere out here. I currently live in Gilbert and there‚Äôs so many grassy parks to walk my dogs it‚Äôs never been an issue. 

Get little hiking booties for their feet if you‚Äôre worried about the pavement being hot. Always limit your outdoor time with your dogs in the summer time and make sure to keep it early morning.

1285,1285,whotookthenamezandl,"There are shitloads of large parks with fields, and many have dog parks with multiple sections nowadays. They're all over, so wherever you wind up, it shouldn't be too hard to find one. If that fits your bill for outdoor activity, then you don't need to worry about cactus and snakes and shit like that. If you take your dogs hiking through the sticks, then that's a different story.

As for heat in the summertime (see: May to September), you just don't go out in the middle of the day. Early morning is premium time. Coolest temperatures, both air and ground. If you DO take your dogs out when it's hot, always put your palm on the asphalt on the street. If it burns you, it's too hot for puppers. It isn't hard to find little booties for dogs online or at PetSmart. Mind you, this is for pavement and rocks/sand. Grass is grass.

Phoenix spread outward pretty evenly during its development, so there are plenty of neighborhoods wherever you want with good-sized backyards. If you live more in the city, shit like snakes and scorpions are almost a non-issue. I live in a neighborhood built in '70 several miles from any patcg of undeveloped land and the only thing I've seen is one or two coyotes in a handful of years. Coyotes aren't a big deal for rowdy dogs, especially rambunctious breeds like beagles. Coyotes rarely rove in multiples through neighborhoods, too. I consider them a non-issue for anything other than toy dogs. (People who let their cats out at night, on the other hand....)

Overall, I recommend NE Phoenix (pretty much anywhere along Tatum, or at least east of SR-51), south Scottsdale (south of Camelback - though it's been getting pricey/college-y over the last decade), and then most parts of Chandler, Gilbert, and Ahwatukee. I can't speak much to the west side as I've never lived west of Central, but I can say the distance between rock-solid neighborhoods grows further and further out that way, if you get me.",1586755213,fn907e5

1291,1291,Level9TraumaCenter,"&gt;Search for a property with a big backyard: are there any certain areas where they have houses with big lots, but smaller houses?

Ask your realtor to look for ""horse properties"". Gilbert and the county islands between Gilbert and Chandler might be good places to look.

Areas that back up against mountains- parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale come to mind- run a greater risk of rattlesnakes. There are avoidance classes for your dogs, and there used to be a ""vaccine"" for rattlesnake envenomation, but it didn't last very long and it was expensive so it kind of went defunct, I think.

Some areas have bark scorpions. They are ""medically significant,"" but I've never heard of a pet dying from one. There have been two small children that have died since the mid-1980s, thanks to an antivenom that was developed.

In terms of predators, there are coyotes, particularly on the west side although I've also seen them once at night in Scottsdale. In 20 years in the SE Valley, I've seen one. I'm sure there are more.

1474,1474,dumbestbell,"&gt;""AZ is last in testing"" that is a logical fallacy. Why do people who have no symptoms need to be tested? This is just a bullshit talking point parroted by people for reasons that make no sense.

Because asymptomatic cases are common and major drivers for spreading the disease. Studies in areas with widespread testing have shown that 40-50% of cases are asymptomatic. How do you know who has it if 50% of people who have it show no symptoms?

&gt;""Social distancing worked"": really? How do you explain Sweden and the other countries that didn't do that and the disease never took hold there either?

Sweden also has one of the highest growth rates of cases in Europe, higher death rates than its neighbors, and models show the swedish health system will be pretty overwhelmed very soon if stricter measures are not implemented, given it also has one of the lowest number of critical care beds per capita in Europe. The rise in cases in Sweden began later, so we haven't really seen the impact it'll have. 

If they don't implement stricter measures there, in a month they will be among europe's worst hit countries. You can bookmark this comment and come back to me if I'm wrong. And I really, truly, hope I'm wrong. But I believe in data-driven decision making, and what I said is just what the data predicts.

&gt; I am against these pacts especially with totalitarian minded buffoons like gavin Newsom. 

Newsom is one of the only leaders in this country that did it right. California had one of the earliest explosions in cases in the world, given its population and density. Yet no Californian hospitals have been overwhelmed, largely because of strict adherence to stay at home policies, and California (and its neighboring states with similarly aggressive measures) will be the first to *loosen* restrictions and return to a semblance of normal life. 

However, it won't be complete until the nation at large has recovered, since even a single case can spark another outbreak. We've seen this happen several times already. Furthermore, East Asian countries like South Korea, who had it under control, are seeing an irregular rise in cases again once they do loosen restrictions.

&gt;yea, not happening and it's not because people aren't getting tested, it's because people are not getting sick like the sky is falling crowd predicated. 

Once again, still too soon to tell. COVID Act Now's epidemiological model predicts that Arizona hospitals will not be overwhelmed with strict adherence to these stay at home policies, but lax adherence (as we've seen so far) will lead to overflows by mid-May.

&gt;Like it or not doom and gloomers, this virus is pissing out.

We still have not seen a sustained reduction in daily cases in any state. This opinion contradicts the data. 

And generally, as epidemiologists will tell you, infectious diseases ""piss out"" by becoming too deadly to their hosts or showing symptoms early enough to get people quarantined or treated in a sterile environment to limit spread. COVID-19 doesn't show symptoms for an irregularly long time while still being infectious, and most cases are mild or asymptomatic while still being infectious. That means it won't ""piss out"" for a long time without a vaccine or literally universal testing, including asymptomatic people, with targeted quarantines.

I would much rather the disease piss out early and us return to normal life thinking we overreacted, than to be swarmed with cases and wish we had reacted more. I said this a month ago, and compared to then, we are in not so great shape. We'll see if that continues.

1485,1485,wrk2crz,"Arizona has statutes that require probation for the first two non dangerous drug possession charges. In my experience, 1st time charge you'll get offered diversion - which is basically drug treatment program- and if you complete it they drop the charges. It's deferred prosecution. After that it's usually a class 1 misdemeanor with summary probation and a shit ton of fines. After you've got a couple of those under your belt then it goes up to a class 6 open felony, then a designated felony, then a felony with some jail as part of probation and then on about your 10th conviction you'll finally get some prison time. This assumes no other criminal history. Prior felonies change things. 

So, expect a chance to do the drug equivalent of traffic school and/or a misdemeanor. Plan to pay a shit ton in mandatory fines and surcharges. 

Make sure you show up for court. You definitely don't want a warrant. You should get appointed an attorney if you can't afford to hire one. Contrary to popular belief, public defenders tend to be really good at their jobs.

Yes, you have the right to bring your politics wherever you go.

Obversely, it is the policies of AZ that helped produce an environment you wanted to move to. 

I have lived in Seattle, California, and many more places. I am glad I moved back to AZ, as leftist policies have turned many of these once beautiful cities completely upside down (as demonstrated by your fleeing).

Arizona is not a Dem state. That is an objectively false statement. We have to most lenient gun laws in the country, as well as a political structure that facilitates capitalism via relaxed regulation. We have strong border and immigration policies and freer choices within the education system.

AG: R

And then you will leave AZ and move on to the next place whose policies and culture have allowed for a nice and prosperous environment. This behavior is parasitic in nature.

I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised you couldn‚Äôt pick that up though, as you cannot even contain your anger and hatred, nor engage in meaningful dialogue. You are here to push your views down others throats; that‚Äôs it. If one disagrees with you they are simply ‚Äústupid assholes‚Äù in your mind. This lack of openness and willingness to engage is the precise reason that you have stunted your intellectual growth.

Additionally, covid-19 and the shut downs are a joke. The virus has killed about 0.008% of Americans and has nearly a 99% recovery rate. I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt try to form pacts and run around terrified of viruses, bacteria, and other causes of death that affect people in much greater magnitudes. But because you have been sold panic and fear you are willing to sacrifice liberty for security. The fact you are so terrified because your news media and leaders have told you to be, regardless of the data, leads me to believe you are a fearful and gullible person in general.

There is no real reason to think Dems (or R‚Äôs) will win this round; it‚Äôs pure speculation. And to attempt to predict the round after next is just ridiculous. You are clearly projecting your desire for a Dem majority. You can say you‚Äôre not a Democrat, but you are. That is what you are registered as and that is how you vote. I‚Äôm sure you hate Republicans/Trump supporters and consider them ‚Äòracists, bigot, homophobes‚Äô (insert offended voice/chant)

I do it out of respect for others who may be more susceptible to the virus.

I didn‚Äôt pull anything out of my ass. If you can cite where I did I‚Äôd like to hear.

Polling and Mike Kelly... most polls are bs. Look into how polls are conducted. They predict results correctly about 50% of the time depending on how they are conducted. They are a data point tho indeed.

I don‚Äôt think the virus is a joke or a hoax; that is demonstrated in the cdc figures I cited in my previous comment. I think the overreaction by governments and media are a joke. Also, technically it is a pandemic; not an epidemic. Epidemics are more localized, whereas pandemics span multiple countries.

You are mad and you have not given me what I deserve. You say that like you spanked me, but you end up looking ignorant and angry w every response you make. It‚Äôs like you are punishing yourself inadvertently.

1694,1694,rakehornpipe,"You have to be careful on BLM land as ranchers have grazing rights that they pay for and defend their territory on that land. I've had a few ranchers, while I was backpacking across the land, get pretty mad I was out there. You typically have to pay to get onto State Park or National Park land. National Forest and Grassland land are free to travel on and do outdoor activities on except in designated recreation areas where a fee is required (basically high traffic areas, the fee pays for upkeep of that area with parking lot updates, restroom cleaning, litter removal, etc).

It is generally illegal to drive any vehicle off forest service roads except when parking to camp and you may not park more than 300' from a roadway to camp in National Forests/Grasslands. However, you can camp anywhere in a National Forest/Grassland if you travel to that campsite by foot and leave you car within 300' of a roadway. 

If overlanding, 4-wheeling, or motorbiking off-road is the goal look for designated OHV areas around the state. [Here is a great guide](https://www.azgfd.com/ohv/) for learning more about that. Also, the ranger district offices will all have Motor Vehicle Use Maps that outline all the trails and roads in the forests that vehicles can use!

The biggest concern with going off a forest service road, National Park road, State Park road, etc. is that you can very easily damage the ecosystem and landscape. Illegally doing so comes with a massive fine. Stick to the dirt roads, we have tens of thousands of miles of them in Arizona.",1586994238,fnj8yon

you pulled tons of shit out of your ass. Basically all your assertions have NO backing from reality. You're like Dunning-Kruger personified.

all you do is gish gallop and I don't have time for it lol. You still haven't even read the fucking pact. It says states would still have full control. dumbass

not many people have died yet because we aren't testing and the country is shut down. Many deaths are being attributed to infections secondary to pneumonia caused by covid-19, and not counted as covid-19 deaths. The US covid-19 outbreak is just getting started, and reopening would be devastating.

The country is not really shut down. A majority of businesses are still operating, especially in AZ.

It‚Äôs actually the opposite of what you claimed... people are dying from covid as a secondary from being obese, diabetic, immune disorders, lung infections, etc. 

covid-19 has actually already peaked and is on the downward slope of the curve. It depends on the state, but generally speaking the virus has plateaus is on decent. 

You can verify all this via cdc and other rusty ale sources easily.

I actually address each of your points in each of my responses. You are unable to do so in your responses because you are intellectually incapable of breaking down a postulation into subsets, understanding them and retorting.

I read the pact. It is a vague turd that actually doesn‚Äôt state anything explicitly or provide and steps to achieve these ambiguous goals.

Change.org is corrupt as hell and always has been. The politicians backing this pact or some of the most crooked out there.

1736,1736,GeoRising,"Our residents‚Äô health comes first. As home to one in six Americans and gateway to the rest of the world, the West Coast has an outsized stake in controlling and ultimately defeating COVID-19.

‚ÄìHealth outcomes and science ‚Äì not politics ‚Äì will guide these decisions. Modifications to our states‚Äô stay at home orders must be made based off our understanding of the total health impacts of COVID-19, including: the direct impact of the disease on our communities; the health impact of measures introduced to control the spread in communities ‚Äîparticularly felt by those already experiencing social disadvantage prior to COVID-19; and our health care systems‚Äô ability to ensure care for those who may become sick with COVID-19 and other conditions. This effort will be guided by data. We need to see a decline in the rate of spread of the virus before large-scale reopening, and we will be working in coordination to identify the best metrics to guide this.

*ZERO PLAN OF ACTION HERE OR CLEARLY STATED GOAL. SIMPLY STATES WHAT EVERY SAME PERSON WOULD DESIRE, WHICH IS SUPPORT FOR THE VULNERABLE, HEALTHCARE WORKERS, AND A DESIRE TO SEE A DECLINE IN METRICS. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO APPEAL STUPID PEOPLE BY STATING THE OBVIOUS AND MAKING THE SURFACE LEVEL THINKERS NOD IN AGREEMENT.

‚ÄìOur states will only be effective by working together. Each state will work with its local leaders and communities within its borders to understand what‚Äôs happening on the ground and adhere to our agreed upon approach.

*AGAIN NO COURSE OF ACTION, OPERATING PROCEDURE, ORDER OF OPERATIONS. AGAIN A BROAD STATEMENT REGURGITATING WHAT IS ALREADY HAPPENING. 

Through quick and decisive action, each of our states has made significant progress in flattening the curve and slowing the spread of COVID-19 among the broader public. Now, our public health leaders will focus on four goals that will be critical for controlling the virus in the future.

*QUICK DECISIVE ACTION.. BY WHO? UNDER WHAT AUTHORITY? WHAT TYPES OF ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN? WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE? WHAT IS A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS? AGAIN, NO STATEMENT OF ACTION, CLEARLY STATED GOAL, OR PLAN.. JUST ANOTHER BROAD STATEMENT THAT ACTUALLY HAS ZERO MEANING.

Protecting vulnerable populations at risk for severe disease if infected. This includes a concerted effort to prevent and fight outbreaks in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.

*STATING THE OBVIOUS, WHAT IS ALREADY HAPPENING. NO PLAN OF ACTION OR OPERATING PROCEDURE ON HOW TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. NO DESCRIPTION OF WHY THIS REQUIRES A PACT BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES. DOES NOT STATE HOW TO PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATION, FIGHT OUTBREAKS IN NURSING HOMES, ETC. IT IS AN EMPTY PARAGRAPH LIKE THE ONES BEFORE IT.


Ensuring an ability to care for those who may become sick with COVID-19 and other conditions (*HOW?) This will require adequate hospital surge capacity and supplies of personal protective equipment (*OBVIOUS STATEMENT AGAIN. OF COURSE SUPPLIES ARE NEEDED. NO DESCRIPTION OF GOALS INCLUDING CURRENT DEFICITS AND SUPPLIES NEEDED, WHAT MEANS THEY HOPE TO PROCURE THEM, WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN GIVEN FROM FEDS, ETC)
Mitigating the non-direct COVID-19 health impacts, particularly on disadvantaged communities (HOW? EMPTY STATEMENT W OUT COURSE OF ACTION, NO IDENTIFICATION OR INDICATION OF WHO THEY ARE, WHAT MAKES THEM DISADVANTAGED OR HOW TO HELP).
Protecting the general public by ensuring any successful lifting of interventions includes the development of a system for testing, tracking and isolating (AGAIN THIS SOUNDS APPEALING, BUT WHERE IS THE PLAN OF ACTION? IT IS AN EMPTY STATEMENT WITHOUT THE HOW. ADDITIONALLY, TRACKING AND ISOLATING COULD BE PROBLEMATIC IF IT MEANS VIOLATING CIVIL RIGHTS. THIS IS WHY DETAILS AND PLAN OF ACTION IS IMPORTANT). The states will work together to share best practices (HOW WILL THEY WORK TOGETHER? WHAT IS THE COMMUNICATION STRUCTURE AMD HIERARCHY OF INFORMATION TRANSMISSION AND HOW WILL INFORMATION BE SHARED AND WHAT WILL BE THE PROTOCOLS FOR DETERMINING WHAT PRACTICES ARE BEST, HOW WILL THESE BE IMPLEMENTED DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND? WHAT IS THE CHAIN OF COMMAND?) .
COVID-19 doesn‚Äôt follow state or national boundaries. It will take every level of government, working together, and a full picture of what‚Äôs happening on the ground.

In the coming days the governors, their staff and health officials will continue conversations about this regional pact to recovery.

For the latter, as you said, the recession caused by this will have a long lasting effect on the job market, and on the ability of many small businesses to bounce back.

1814,1814,ArizonaRepublic,"*Via reporter Ryan Randazzo:*

The coronavirus pandemic didn't slow down growth in Arizona's medical marijuana program, state figures show, with qualified patients buying more than a ton more marijuana in March than they did in February.

The 17,095 pounds of marijuana sold by medical-marijuana dispensaries in March was more than 2,200¬†pounds above what was sold in February, a jump of 15%.

The state's medical marijuana program, estimated to be the third largest in the country, has grown¬†by leaps and bounds for years. That didn't change in March as businesses across the state shut down to prevent spreading coronavirus. It was in fact the highest monthly sales total in the history of the program.

Marijuana dispensaries remain open during the pandemic, though many have instituted a variety of safety measures including, in many cases, requiring patients to line up at least six feet from one another outside.

Many dispensaries already offered delivery options before the pandemic that remain available as well.

The monthly report from the Department of Health Services shows that Friday, March 13 had the highest number of transactions for the month, with more than 40,000¬†sales recorded that day.",1587065071,fnm4qyw

Trump is selling off our empire for pennies on the dollar. He is bad at being evil. Obama was greedy etc, but good at it. didn't just rub it in your face, instead quietly drone striked you while convincing the rest of the world America was the good guys.

Trump has handled it very poorly thus far, at least for the people and economy over all. He has given his friends quite a bit, but again could have made more money and fucked people over less if he was smarter. Or be closer to a full dictatorship. I'm offended by his incompetence.

We will have better numbers in a year or two, then we'll know. Him removing our emerging disease guy in China, convincing people covid-19 is no big deal, removing other cdc staff, profiting massively off of ppe, refusing to use the defense production act, and waiting SOOOO LONG to take action makes it VERY difficult to believe he's doing well by the people. We could have been like Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan. instead we will be worse than italy.

anywho... peacy-out, bojobro! üòÑ‚úåÔ∏è

edit: to be clear, I do not think Obama was better for the material well-being of most people. He's just competent, as opposed to Trump's slipshod style.

Obama is controlled opposition (worked for IBC, known CIA front lol... well trained). Trump is a greedy oligarch who is enabled by a lot of different BS. Trump IS good at branding. like, putting his name on those checks is smart. It's surprising how bad the rest are tbh

Hemp farming uses 50% less water than cotton/alfalfa and can replace cotton for clothes, alfalfa for feed and be used as oil/fuel etc.  Plans like this could take down large swaths of water usage. Another option is vertical farming investments which would be nice to have as they are consistent and can use less land for more crops.

We really need to push farming types that use less water. This is a great plan coupled with water re-use like Vegas in cities and conservation benefits, such as paying to replace with more xeriscapes or water efficient landscapes.

I think lots of our decisions and systems are based on the good times not just in Arizona.  

It seems like business people would understand. In business, companies that start during recessions usually have longer trajectories because they start in a scarce state without waste. Companies started when everything was booming sometimes don't have to understanding how bad it can get.  Apple for instance still hoards cash, largely because they nearly fizzled out in the 90s before Jobs return. 

&gt;I just don‚Äôt see how some commodity crops even make sense here.

Yeah some of it makes sense from a CO2 capture, oxygen production and dust covering benefit, but overall we really should tighten it up to less water thirsty crops and [maybe eventually more vertical/indoor farms that water use can be 1/20th (95% less water used as it is recycled) for any crop as irrigation wastes lots of water](http://www.verticalfarminstitute.org/vertical-farming/). One acre of land farm could be 95% more water efficient indoors and many times more crops per one acre. This is also nice for locally grown vegetables and is really a perfect environment. Many of these technologies are like doing it on Mars in Arizona but it could be a huge industry here at 95% less water usage.

We will probably have to get to a water recycling system like Vegas, they recycle all water.  Tucson does do a good job of it now because they are end of the line.

Being a water conservation leader would be nice, same with solar. I would love Arizona to be a solar power and water conservation innovative state for the world to model against.  Even having desert farm/water techniques, rain reuse/capture, vertical farms as well that also had massive solar installations including on the vertical/indoor farms and on all buildings and parking garages.

I mean, towns in northern Arizona were told to let their gardens die and that they couldn‚Äôt wash their cars that year while everybody in Phoenix had a swimmy, golfy water-parky summer.
