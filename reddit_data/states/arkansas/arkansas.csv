Conway can be a cool little town but most places in Arkansas are going to feel tiny coming from the NE.  I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much about the qualitative differences between Greenbrier and Conway except that Greenbrier is much smaller than Conway.  Personally, being an AR native that is well traveled and has lived elsewhere, I would move to Conway.  Conway has 3 decent size colleges so there will be a ‚Äúbrain trust‚Äù there if you can get in those circles.

Plus side, there is a ton for outdoorsey families to do in Conway area, with easy access to Ouachita National Forest, Ozark National Forest, and Buffalo National River.  Conway is also 45 minutes or so from Little Rock.

There‚Äôs like 10x the population (if not more) so the more people there are, the more crime there will be obviously. There are lots of places around to hunt, fish, hike, exercise, etc. There is an event center in greenbrier to run, exercise, play basketball, etc. It‚Äôs like a dollar a day to use it. Theres also a gym in town. I think the last murder here was 25+ years ago, but there was a murder (a domestic issue I think) just outside of greenbrier like last year or the year before. Conway has a ton of places to eat. Like half the businesses are food places. There‚Äôs several state parks close enough to take a day trip to hike and hang out like Woolly Hollow and Petit Jean. 

Anyway, I wouldn‚Äôt want to live in Conway. I don‚Äôt even really enjoy just driving in it but that‚Äôs where the stuff is. Greenbrier/Wooster area is still small enough to not be annoying driving in it. Maybe I just hate other drivers, lol. Also the round about on Dave Ward Drive in front of Academy Sports is horrible.

On the bright side, there's plenty of football.  Several high schools in the area and 2 college football teams in Conway.  UCA has always had a good team, and they have recently moved up in class.  Hendrix has had a football team for only a few years.

I lived in Conway in the '90's and I don't know much about the culture now.  It's a dry county: no liquor stores.  There are a few restaurants offering liquor by the drink.  You need to travel to get package liquor.  And if you go to Little Rock for the night, you had best have a sober driver.

62,JoePants,"You'll like the area. Tell your wife central Arkansas has a strong running community.

Greenbrier's nice, but I wouldn't lock in. Wooster, for that matter, between GB and Conway is often seen as an area with a lot of potential. With that said West Conway continues to grow. (My son and his fiance live in GB.)

Both GB and Conway have a great school system. Football culture is very big here, huge, and HS football especially so. (GB is currently building a monster field house.) The Friday night game is a cultural touch stone. That's true about anywhere in this part of the country. Basketball runs a close second, and baseball is also big. Games at UCA are fun (UCA is a nice cultural outlet) and draw a crowd.

Once in a while you might go down to Little Rock to see the Hogs play when they come down from Fayetteville. That's a scene, baby. Learn how to call the hogs. You've got to learn how to call the hogs. (Look it up.)

Making what you're making and looking at space, you might want to check the Round Mountain area on the west side of Conway. Up to you. I'd kinda' lean away from Mayflower, but you might find the right place at the right price there.

Perry county, right across the river, nice area, but now you're getting way out in the country.

You will meet people who grew up with the house phone on a party line. Rural Arkansas was still rural into the 60s. For that matter you'll meet people whose (great) grandparents homesteaded on land to the north, up in the foothills.

Conway, however, if pretty cosmopolitan in the grand scheme of things - the universities have a lot to do with that, I suppose. That and people like y'all coming in.

Check utility rates before you make up your mind. Conway's pretty cheap, with Conway Corp supplying everything including (pretty good) internet. When you get out of town rates can go up pretty fast.

The weather: There's a period from July 4 to Labor Day where you won't believe the heat, you just won't believe it. It's the humidity, actually. You'll sweat. Don't worry, everyone else is sweating. That's just how it goes (your wife will go for runs early in the morning - with the others).

Start getting rid of your winter clothes now. You're not going to need them. Winter here lasts about three weeks, and is usually marked by an ice storm which shuts down everything - I mean everything. Snow plows are all-but non existent.

Camping and hunting? For days bro, for days. They will be in a paradise - and likely have a bunch of school friends into the same thing. Deer hunting is big, as is duck hunting. Small game, of course, all you can stand. It won't be unusual, and actually likely, that you join a deer camp, that is with a group who takes out a land lease as a sort-of hunting preserve. Plenty of state property as well. The black bear population is growing, and there's elk to the north (lot of competition to get an elk tag, however).

You'll be eating venison, that's for sure.

(I took out an 8 point on the way from Wooster to Conway on Hwy 25 a year ago using my Nissan, Sentra gauge. Some kid stopped and I gave him the deer; we loaded it in his pickup while I was talking to the state police on the phone for the accident report. That's an Arkansas story. And I'm not a hunter, it's just the deer was stupid.)

Toad Suck: And no, you don't actually suck the toads. There's a drawn-out story about the old river men giving the place it's name, but that's likely hooey. It has more to do with what the old folks used to call mud flats on the river bend. Whatever. Toad Suck Daze in Conway is yearly and fun.

In time you'll use ""y'all."" Make sure to try biscuits and gravy early in your stay here, with bonus points for chocolate gravy. You'll put your groceries in a sack and, should the context provide, you'll put on your britches before you go outside and do something. Fried catfish and hush puppies are a joy, and you'll want to get some good barbecue early on as well (this is how we trap people - barbecue addiction).

Source: I moved to Conway about 33 years ago and married a local girl having lived in Tennessee a few years (barbecue addiction) after being born and raised in Philly.

Wouldn't income be relevant for child support?",1577979425,fcuf3bb
118,BigBennP,"&gt;Wouldn't income be relevant for child support?

Let me be more specific.  Income is relevant, but the issues are relatively simple.

The Arkansas State Legislature and the Court system have developed [charts](https://www.arcourts.gov/sites/default/files/formatted-files/child_monthly20070614_1.pdf) that set the amount of support you owe based on your [weekly, biweekly or monthly income.](https://www.arcourts.gov/forms-and-publications/arkansas-child-support-guidelines)  

A judge can deviate up or down from the amount on the chart ""for good cause shown."" 

The standard procedure in a paternity case is to ask the non-custodial parent (usually the father) to fill out [an affidavit](https://www.arcourts.gov/sites/default/files/formatted-files/AffidavitOfFinancialMeansOctober2016_0.pdf), under oath, stating their current income. That information is then used to set support.   Custody cases get *slightly* more complicated because joint custody and one parent contributing in-kind support can be taken into account. 

The only way long term income history comes into play is if there's a claim that someone is hiding income or avoiding support.  Then it's still fairly simple in terms of well, what has your average income been over X years, then you set support based on that.  The law is in favor of kids getting supported and not in favor of parents who try to game the system, so a judge isn't going to be reversed on not wanting to listen to a bunch of arguments about why an average income wasn't good enough.",1577981964,fcuitar

Campus is kind of isolated from the rest of town. Overtly religious, very white evangelical environment - you'll encounter lots of religious discussion on campus and in class, and some explicitly christian required coursework. Mandatory chapel attendance. Gotta sign a weird purity culture pledge. Lots of preachers kids and children from overseas missions. Limited in perspectives, in a big way, that you would encounter at a non religious school.

I wouldn't recommend it. IME you get a better, rounder, fuller 'growing up and figuring out who you are as a person' experience at a non-religious institution. Which is a huge part of what college is for.

353,charlesharsha,"Lot of variables to consider and varies for each person. What kind of weather do you prefer, how much do want to pay for rent, do you want a beach nearby. Also depends on what part of the state, obviously 

Arkansas- grew up in a small north central town, as a kid it was boring just because we didn't have a mall. Now I realize how great it was.  Just moved back to the Fayetteville area and I like it. Plenty to do. Super cheap to live here. Not a fan of the cold but I'll survive, hopefully 

California- was stationed in San Diego when I was in the Marines and for 4 years after when I worked for the DOD (2007-2012, 2015-2019).  I loved the ability to do about anything, 30mins to Mexico, 4hrs to Vegas, 3 hours to snow board, beaches, sporting events, etc.  But paying 4$ for a gallon of milk, 4$ gallon of gas, and 1700 for a shitty 2 bedroom one bath in not the best of area got old.  Maybe if I was better with money I could of enjoyed it more. Oh yea, weather is phenomenal

Florida- moved Fort myers when I got out of the Marines 2013-2015.  I loved it there. I lucked out and shared a house with my sister, her friend and her boyfriend.  We lived about 100yards from the ocean. Was able to walk to work. Paid 350 a month, fucking amazing. Enjoyed the constant partying beach life things were cheap for me. Looked at moving back but it's pricey, still will always be an option for me.

Hawaii- never been. No urge to live there as the cost of living is as bad as California and I'm just not comfortable being out in the middle of nowhere. 

TLDR: California if money isn't an issue, Arkansas for a cheap simple life, Hawaii no. Florida is where I'd like to be.",1578373743,fdfyfxe

It looks to me like he just let his foot off the brake, probably after the officer shot in to the car BEFORE he scrambled to put himself in front of the already moving car.

This isn‚Äôt the first time an officer has scrambled to put themselves in the path of a vehicle for justification to kill in Little Rock.  It‚Äôs just that this time there is video.  

At the very least the officer broke multiple policies before shots were fired as well as endangered his own life the way he blocked in the car and left himself exposed when exiting his car. 

What ever happened to the days where cops protected themselves with their vehicle until backup arrived and yelled orders to the driver to exit the car, back up with hands on head, etc?

Seems like the new way is put yourself in path of car and if it moves empty your gun in to the vehicle, regardless of how many innocent passengers are in the car.

Sex education statistically works. Compare the incidents of unwanted teenage pregnancy during the Bush and Obama administrations.

Arkansas btw leads the nation in unwanted teenage pregnancy.

And for the legislature to pass a ban on female genital mutilation is another case of creating a problem that doesn't really exist just to *dis* the Muslim community.

Edit: I can pretty much guarantee you will not enjoy living in Searcy unless you like cruising down the main strip, hanging out in parking lots, being back home by 10pm. Which is all fine if you are in to those kinds of things.

Edit 2: I would say things are def shoved down your throat. I had numerous friends who attended and were told they shouldn't have LGBT friends for instance. One friend told me a lesbian in her year was asked to leave once she came out. This was 12 years ago, but its not a place rife with progress.

I think a remember an AR Times article about a lesbian zine that was getting passed around and talking about a website where other LGBTQ people could connect and access was blocked on Harding devices. 

Edit 3: something else to consider is what you will be studying. If it's something that would be inhibited if viewed through the Christian lens, which it will be at Harding, you will have to learn to educate yourself in some ways.

Decide what is most important to you.  Are you wanting to go to a college with the least expense?  More of the traditional college experience? A particular program?

656,Shaqattack2001,"I had a good friend who went there because he was offered an athletic scholarship and he said it was a serious mistake after a year. It is not a school for someone who is nonreligious. He was someone who went to church growing up and he hated it. The biological science classes all come with some addendum about how they fit within the mold of Christianity. And you are required to take theology seminars and stuff. Searcy is also a garbage college town in my opinion. There is very little to do and it's in a dry county as well.

I would give some serious thought to what degree you'll pursue or at least a general path you think you'd like to follow and look at what schools in the area offer good programs and have a positive reputation for them. Look at the area you'll be in and how much they cost as well. If you are wanting to stay at home, look into UALR. If you aren't sure what you want to do, Henderson State is a good liberal arts college. They require students to take courses from all disciplines. I know people who have gone to UCA, A-State, Tech, and the U of A and they've all enjoyed their time there.

759,BrautanGud,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî An Arkansas attorney is suing local officials for denying him access to a courthouse while carrying a handgun, testing a state law meant to allow lawyers to possess firearms on court premises, according to the law‚Äôs authors.

Chris Corbitt, a patent attorney from Conway, filed the complaint last Thursday against Pulaski County officials after a security guard refused to let him enter the county‚Äôs district courthouse on Jan. 3 while he carried his concealed gun.

Corbitt, a concealed-carry licensee with an enhanced permit, said he usually leaves his weapon in his car, but that he forgot to before he walked into the courthouse earlier this month.

State law bans firearms from courthouses, except for bailiffs and other ‚Äúofficers of the court.‚Äù Corbitt argues that definition includes attorneys.

**There are still 16 state dispensaries and two cultivators that have not opened for business, but the commission is tired of excuses as to why and is questioning what should have been enforced for the dispensaries from the start.**

""I think one of our biggest decisions and biggest responsibilities as a commission is really holding these licenses and licensees accountable,"" commissioner Travis Story said.

It's a question of how the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission is working with the Alcohol Beverage Control board (ABC) to find out what is going on with the state's unopened dispensaries on the cusp of when they're supposed to be renewing their licenses.

""He's not acquiring this license to sit on it, he's acquiring it with the full understanding that the commission expects this thing to be up and going,"" Capitol Law Group partner Alex Gray said, representing Pine Bluff Agriceuticals and Arkansas Patient Services.

**The above dispensaries are asking for a change of ownership, one before they even break ground.**

But the commission says no and that those originally awarded a license should be responsible for opening doors.

...

A year later and they are not open and some want to sell their ownership rights before even opening? There are plenty of other Arkansans who can step in and fill these voids I would think. Has this even occurred in another MM state?",1579103017,fegut0x

Also, these regulatory bodies generate tax revenue that's used for public works and benefits society as a whole. Appropriate regulation is a good thing. It's hard to argue against it: look at countries that have poor regulation regarding working conditions and product safety. 

That's not getting into the problem of rational actors.

Anyway, this regulatory body is addressing an issue wherein individuals  were granted license to sell marijuana, and then abused that license for personal gain instead of the intended use. Which is ridiculous, because we found ourselves in this situation due to The licensing regulations which were designed to concentrate wealth, not benefit the people.

if more people got out and voted, we probably wouldn't have found ourselves in this mess. The majority of Arkansans do not vote in local elections or participate in our democracy in any way. Instead, a small group of wealthy individuals influenced legislation for personal gain.",1579144074,feipm60

I think they should yank the licenses like they said they were going to and then give it to the next guy down the list if they didn‚Äôt break ground before the end of the year. So I think this is some companies probably transferring their licenses to the highest bidder.

838,BrautanGud,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî A 78-year-old Arkansas man has been sentenced to a year of probation after mailing white powder and a threatening letter about slavery reparations to Republican Sen. Tom Cotton‚Äôs office in Washington two years ago.

Henry Edward Goodloe, who is black, pleaded guilty in¬†federal court last August¬†to a count of conveying false information about possessing a biological weapon for the letter that he mailed to the white senator. **He admitted to mailing an envelope containing a modest amount of white powder, wrapped in plastic, to Cotton‚Äôs office, in addition to a note stating, ‚ÄúYou ignored me. Maybe this will get your attention.**‚Äù

During Tuesday‚Äôs sentencing, U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker admonished Goodloe to have ‚Äúno communication or other interaction‚Äù with Cotton without receiving permission from the U.S. Probation Office, the¬†Arkansas Democrat-Gazette¬†reported.

She told Goodloe that while ‚Äúit‚Äôs reasonable to expect a response from your elected officials,‚Äù his method of complaining ‚Äúis a crime.‚Äù

A Senate mail facility intercepted the letter, which included Goodloe‚Äôs home address in Pine Bluff, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock. A hazardous response team determined that the powder was unbleached flour and starch, according to prosecutors.

His lawyer, Nicole Lybrand, said in court papers that ‚Äúafter discussing it all with the FBI agents, Mr. Goodloe agreed that it was not a good idea and that his thinking at the time that he mailed it was different than his thinking now.‚Äù",1579187538,fejwmp4

Ran some facebook ads for $50, used that thumbnail from fiver, and linked to 123mainst.com, Targeted looking to moving couples, new families, and basically all of central arkansas zip codes. 

Went to a title company and asked for some For Sale by Owner paper work. 

They gave me a contract that was an offer form, walked me through expected costs, and what to do. 

They told me everything I needed. 

I went to walmart, bought a bunch 10 cent folders. Printed off a little one pager with a cute photo of the house, grocery stores and restaurants near by, average power bill, and internet bill. Included that one pager, and offer contract in the folder. Gave that to two people that came on the first weekend. 

All in, I spent under $100 and 2 hours of my time. I wanted to create that packet so it looked like I cared, and maybe someone would want to do a For Sale By Owner, and not be sure how to do it. I had no idea either, but I wanted to look like I knew how to do it.

842,fancycheesus,"***Incoming wall of speculation and conjecture***

This is a super interesting post, so I tried some quick googling to see what's up. Best I can tell, regulations about rainwater collection has some legitimate basis under water rights laws which are super old. Most of the country uses the old riparian rights system just meaning that anyone next to the water gets to use it, but some places out west where water is scarcer have stricter rules that place protections for downstream individuals so that one person doesn't just siphon off all the water for themselves.

I can only think of two justifications for trying to regulate rainwater. (1) we want to stop people in dry areas from catching all the rain which would normally end up running down stream. (2) we want to stop people from catching water which would normally go back into the soil or underground water tables.

I think this law has to be aimed at reason #2 given Arkansas is not a dry climate and also Arkansas' water table(s) has ominously been depleting recently. If we dry up too much, we won't be able to support the farming that contributes so much to our state economy. My guess is that by preventing potable uses of water, we are trying to guarantee that rainwater makes its way back into the earth.

Or.... Theory #3 says Arkansas has too many mosquitoes as it is, so we don't need any more buckets of standing water",1579196414,fekb7rh

One map shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, including **Arkansas**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

(Originally made for the MapPorn subreddit. I wanted to post here as well.) I was going to make it a positive map (states that *do* have a minimum habitability law) but I realized that Arkansas was the only one that didn't.

As an Arkansan, this *really* upsets me. We are the only state that doesn't require landlords to make their properties habitable, and that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. I can personally confirm that this is a *huge* problem. Most people in my general area live in homes unfit for living, and have not the financial means to themselves solve the issue. And even when they do, that comes at the expense of things they need, like paying the bills or putting food on the table. Combined with our [archaic 10-day eviction policy](https://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-18/subtitle-2/chapter-16/subchapter-1/18-16-101), this makes life for low-income tenants especially hard. And [Arkansas is one of the poorest states in the union](https://talkpoverty.org/state-year-report/arkansas-2015-report). I think a change is well overdue. There *are* federal laws, but they obviously aren't doing enough when people are [living in hazardous conditions](https://www.thv11.com/article/home/lack-of-renters-rights-in-arkansas-leads-to-hazardous-conditions-for-one-little-rock-resident/91-609715358) and [getting sick.](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/jul/08/study-links-sick-tenants-to-run-down-ap/)",1579390093,feuulu6

978,33sixtynine,"That's a reason why.  There's a saying, ""You get what you pay for.""  

That does mean, however, that if this policy was reversed that rent would go up.  I personally would prefer that over the current system. Regardless of cost, Arkansas looks really bad with all these homes being unfit to live in.  And we really need to work on our reputation.  Also, people are more likely to pay higher rent than themselves pay to make the house fit to live in (especially if there's a risk of later being evicted and the benefits going to the landlord).",1579394919,fev9yag
979,33sixtynine,"You make a good point.  Should I note, first, that I said ""one of the poorest"" and not ""poorest"", for anyone currently unaware.  While we may have smaller paychecks, what we pay out is definitely less.  And this is correlated, to a degree.  Lower cost of living, means we don't need our wages to be as high, and higher wages translates to higher prices.

And reversing the policy, and imposing a minimum habitability, would increase rent.  Though, there would be a net benefit, both in the fact that people are more likely to pay a higher rent than to themselves make the house livable, and in our state's reputation, which is definitely hurt by so many houses being unlivable.",1579395531,fevbtxb

The landlord kept making vague promises about fixing it and the lease did not actually require him to, nor would he provide a window unit. Withholding rent is not a legal option in Arkansas. They held out as long as they could before they broke the lease and moved in with family.

&gt; What happens when you can't afford a place to rent? 

Minimum habitability doesn't solve poverty.  We have to do that in other ways.  You shouldn't settle for living in pieces of shit just because you're poor.  That's not a solution, that's a symptom.  If you want to solve poverty, there's ways of doing that.

People can find a place to rent in all other 50 states, so I don't see why it would become a problem here.  Minimum habitability won't make it harder to find a place to rent, it will just make it so your options are better.  Maybe more expensive, but better.

&gt; Imagine being fined $125 every time the grass grows higher than 4 inches. 

The landlord will be fined, not the renters.  And regardless, that's not what minimum habitability means.  There's a huge difference between black mold and overgrown grass.

&gt; Because you're fighting against the people who you say you're fighting for. 

I never said I'm fighting for the landlords.  I'm fighting for the people, the poor, the renters.  Those who have not the voice nor the means to challenge the lobbyists in Little Rock and Washington.  I'll be happy to fight for the landlords too, so long as they're willing to be decent human beings ‚Äî and a lot of them are ‚Äî but many aren't, and that's what I'm fighting against.

I have no ill will and want things as fair as possible for every human being. I'm 100% positive there is a middle ground however I feel the way I do from my experiences, just as you do. 

I've rented several properties between 2008 and 2016. I'd find a place, get orders, move out, deploy, come home, find another place, deploy and so on. 16 addresses in 10 years, then in 2016 I bought a house and lived there until 1 month ago. 

For 2 years now, I've been a civilian and have lost rights afforded to military families in breaking leases, having background checks waived, security deposits waived and so on. 

This last month has been a massive eye opener.  Tenets rights have ruined the market for rentals.  It's so much of a risk and takes up so much time it's not worth a landlord renting a home out. It's easier and unfortunately a better idea to hire a company to do it. The companies now get to bleed both parties dry and are professionals at writing contracts that make tenants responsible for anything and everything that happens. So any law that was written to protect a tenant is now null and void by most lengthy contracts. I passed on 2 properties after paying the 190 back ground fee each time after I read the contract. That's $380 I threw away just to see a contract. One contract read, ""Responsible for any repairs under 1000 dollars"". In what world would anyone agree to that? People who dont have a choice and just need a place to live.. That is just 1 example from 20+ pages. Sad part is, I make good money and don't have kids so I do have options. However still, I'm renting Well below my means because I still have a mortgage to pay in Arkansas.  If Texas had similar rights as Arkansas landlords do, it wouldn't be so hard for families to move around and put themselves in better situations. 

I understand this is just my experience and other's experiences may vary. This is just my long drawn out 2 cents.


TLDR: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Giving tenants rights will only harden the company's that rent, making longer contracts and ultimately pushing responsiblity onto the tenants all while raising rent.",1579507489,ff2iefw

YouTube videos are typically not great arguments in themselves, and this one is particularly lacking.

But okay, let's say Trump was honestly doing this to expose real corruption, providing proof of that should be very easy for the president of the most powerful country on Earth with all it's resources at his disposal. With any proof of his claims, this entire situation we are in now would not exist. Yet instead of offering any evidence, he decided to stonewall, to block anyone from testifying about it, told people to defy congressional subpoenas, had his call logs hidden on a secret server etc. This is not typically what people do when they are legitimately trying to expose corruption. In fact this looks very much like the kind of thing one would do in a cover up. All he had to do was just give some evidence to avoid this situation, any reasonable person would have been totally prepared to do that.

It is true Biden's son was on the board of Burisma and it looks very fishy and messed up, but is it illegal? Unfortunately I doubt it is. The other side of this though is that if nepotism like this were illegal, we would need to immediately take a look at Ivanka, and Jared, (and maybe Eric, and Don Jr. too) because none of them have any experience relative to the ""work"" they are doing either.

1150,BrautanGud,"NORTHWEST ARKANSAS, Ark. (KNWA) ‚Äì Medical marijuana dispensaries in Northwest Arkansas could soon be growing plants on site.

According to Scott Hardin, Medical Marijuana Commission Spokesperson, 23 of the 32 licensed dispensaries in the state will be able to grow the product.

That includes all four licensed dispensaries in Northwest Arkansas.

The Source in Bentonville says it will submit plans to the city next week, and if approved it will likely have products available by the end of summer.

Eric Ludwick with Acanza Health Group in Fayetteville says it‚Äôs also on track to grow, and it could impact the price of the product.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just supply and demand. When there are more products available, more strains available, we will be able to showcase that for the patients to see something a little different from what they‚Äôve seen these past few months. When there‚Äôs more on hand it will drop in price eventually,‚Äù he said.

Ludwick says pending inspection, it could be growing in the next few months.

Once cultivation begins, there will be 24-hour security at Acanza.

Before a dispensary begins the growing process, green rooms are inspected and signed off on.

Up to 50 marijuana plants can be grown on-site.",1579624683,ff6d9s1
1151,BrautanGud,"""Greetings from Crater of Diamonds State Park! 2019 was a great year for diamond finds at the Crater. Visitors from Arkansas, 36 other states, and one foreign country found 491 diamonds during the year, including 336 white gems, 73 brown, and 82 yellow. The total weight for all diamonds registered last year was 99.14 carats, 22 carats heavier than all diamonds found in 2018!

The average weight of diamond found last year was around 20 points, or one-fifth of a carat. Though most were found by wet sifting, a method which involves sorting large quantities of gravel by size and weight, about one in every ten diamonds were found on top of the ground at the park, including many of the year‚Äôs largest finds!

Visitors found about one diamond per day in January and February 2019. As visitation picked up in March, so did the number of finds. 101 diamonds had been registered by the first day of spring last year, but only one of these weighed more than one carat. March was the busiest month for park visitation, as well as diamond finds, with 71 diamonds registered during the month.""",1579625344,ff6ebx8

&gt;The future of a lot of programs and government spending is clearly on the line.  
&gt;  
&gt;Near the top of the list of concerns for the American public is the future of Social Security. Although Social Security has been a financial pillar since it was signed into law more than 84 years ago, the latest annual Trustees report, and the 33 before it, haven't painted the brightest outlook for our nation's most successful social program.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the Trustees report, Social Security's more than $2.9 trillion in asset reserves (that is, its net-cash surpluses built up since inception) are expected to be [completely exhausted by 2035](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2019/05/03/social-securitys-asset-reserves-will-be-gone-by-20.aspx) as the result of numerous ongoing demographic changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the [bright side](https://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2016/03/19/will-social-security-last-until-i-retire.aspx), Social Security doesn't need a dime in reserves to continue making payouts to its beneficiaries. Its recurring sources of income -- the 12.4% payroll tax on earned income, and the taxation of Social Security benefits -- ensure that money will always flow into the program for disbursement to eligible beneficiaries. On the other hand, retired workers could see their benefits cut by up to 23% if the program's cash shortfall isn't dealt with pretty soon.

Bottom line. Social Security is going to get cut. It can either take a controlled burn approach, and do so, rationally over time, or wait until, like a wildfire, it is going to become an, out of control, burning issue. 

Either way, it won't matter much to me, but I am telling my kids to plan like it won't be there for them, because no one wants to take a responsible approach, today.",1579810711,ffczymm

Moving the eligibility age for social security back is an effort to save a dying program, not a punishment ""because republicans hate poor people."" 

On the note of changing food stamps. Change how? I agree there are those who need it, and those who abuse it. Any effort to cut off those who abuse it, I'm in favor of. If you need help, there are charities, and churches. get involved with your community. There are people willing to help. Also, historically, recessions that are overdue are far easier to get through. Save for those times during the good times, and you'll be fine.

As for tax cuts. I'll use your anecdote as an example. You only listed the negatives. Yes, people lost their job. It sucks. I want you to realize, though, that those robots are more cost effective for the company, meaning they're able to make the same amount of product or more for cheaper. That cost reduction often translates to the buyer, especially if competition is involved. So, where you see less pay, others see cheaper products. Less taxes also incentivise businesses to stay in an are they otherwise would leave, which would take all jobs with them, not just some.

Yes, many in arkansas aren't making large amounts of money compared to other states, but we also have a lower cost of living. 50,000 here is far better than 50,000 in California. A lot of thereason for that? Low taxes.

On one hand, witg nationalized healthcare, taxpayers pay for it all, and have no control over how much is spent on it. If you know anything about government spending, they overpay for everything, and the politicians don't know anything, so when a bill goes across the floor saying we need X more millions of dollars, they generally sign it. This isn't to mention that wait times will increase, quality of care decreases, innovation and invention decreases.

If  we look at private health insurance with less government oversight, everyone pays their own. Open up competition between states, and prices go down. Make health insurance companies and hospitals more transparent, so you actually know what it is you're paying for, instead of this ""don't look behind the curtain"" thing we have going on now, where you pay $30 for gauze, and have no clue. Deregulate health insurance enough to where starting a business isn't as hard as it is now, encourage competition, have them be transparent, and prices will drop. But you will have to pay it out of pocket. Not someone you don't know 4 states away who hasn't been to the hospital in 20 years.

1359,TheFatMan2200,"&gt;I don't fully align with the GOP on all policies, but I fundamentally disagree with the notion that the federal government has to take care of everyone at taxpayer expense. 

What do you define as ""take care of everyone at taxpayer expense""? what all does that include? 

&gt;There are consequences for not saving for retirement, and social security should be a bonus on your existing savings, instead of your primary income for retirement. 

Yes people should save, but I am just saying that when you have been paying into something for 30+ years, it is not a ""bonus"". By this logic a 401K or IRA should be a bonus too. These are things people contributed too. If a person only paid into their 401K and IRA, and still received social security after never contributing to it, then it would be a bonus. That is not the case with Social Security, People paid their tax and expect the benefit from that tax. 

&gt;Moving the eligibility age for social security back is an effort to save a dying program, not a punishment ""because republicans hate poor people.""

Except the problem is that social security does not need to be the go to thing to cut. There is no reason to have a $750 billion dollar military budget. I would rather us save some money by producing a few less bombs and choppers that we don't need then pushing the retirement age back.  The thing is there are other things we can cut that does not involve screwing over average Americans. 

&gt;On the note of changing food stamps. Change how? I agree there are those who need it, and those who abuse it. Any effort to cut off those who abuse it, I'm in favor of.

I couldn't honestly give two craps about food stamps. It is such a tiny blip on the budget. I do care about financial loop holes for corporations and the wealthy, that impacts the budget way more than food stamps ever will. The wealthy now being able to use their private jets as a tax write off probably costs tax payers way more than those abusing food stamps, if not the bulk of the entire program. And no, them being able to write off their jets does not in any way ""create jobs"". I don't want any program being abused but you are talking about arresting the guy stealing crumbs while the whole bakery is being robbed. Priorities dude. 

&gt; If you need help, there are charities, and churches. get involved with your community. There are people willing to help. 

It is great to be involved with the community and I highly recommend it, but I pay taxes for a reason, so there are guaranteed services to help when needed. Even as a religious person, I am not going to solely rely on the church for charities for help. I want to be able to rely on a program with regulation and oversight, especially if I am paying into it. 

Christian cost-sharing ministries are a perfect example of why it is a problem to do exactly what you are suggesting.

 [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/health/christian-health-care-insurance.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/health/christian-health-care-insurance.html) 

And that is not a bash on churches, I like the work that mine does for instance, but I am not soley going to rely on them (I will solely rely on God, but not the church) and when I am really in need I want to know there are programs that will help me, not tell to pray the disease way, even after I paid into that ministry.

&gt;Also, historically, recessions that are overdue are far easier to get through. Save for those times during the good times, and you'll be fine.

Where is your source for this?? When the next recession does not determine how hard or easy it will be to get through, but parts of the economy are effected, and what tools we have at our disposal to weather through the recession. 

&gt;As for tax cuts. I'll use your anecdote as an example. You only listed the negatives. Yes, people lost their job. It sucks. I want you to realize, though, that those robots are more cost effective for the company, meaning they're able to make the same amount of product or more for cheaper. That cost reduction often translates to the buyer, especially if competition is involved. So, where you see less pay, others see cheaper products. Less taxes also incentivise businesses to stay in an are they otherwise would leave, which would take all jobs with them, not just some.

As for the tax cuts- all they resulted in where massive stock buy backs, not any of the trickle down promises that republicans sold. Almost like Trickle down does not work. Also, what about that promise that they were generate so much wealth to pay for themselves and bring down the deficit. Well that was a bunch of balony, considering the deficit has frown over a trillion dollars. And on that, it boggles my mind how conservatives are not all up the Trump administrations ass about this. You all defend cutting social security with every breath, but turn a complete blind eye to the reckless over spending being done right now to warrant the discussion of budget cuts? 

Personally I am fine with things like self check outs but it does not automatically, mean cheaper prices for the buyer. There is almost never a cut in prices, a pump in remaining workers pay, or competition growth for such actions, what there are, are executive bonuses and shareholder value increases,and don't even try to counter with ""job creating"" cause jobs were just cut in the first place to make such shareholder value. 

&gt;Yes, many in arkansas aren't making large amounts of money compared to other states, but we also have a lower cost of living. 50,000 here is far better than 50,000 in California. A lot of thereason for that? Low taxes.

Low taxes are not the reason for this. At least for the reason you think so. The cost of living difference between California and Arkansas has to do with the economic size of each state for one. California is the 6th or 7th largest economy in the world, so that means there are jobs that people want to move their for. People moving there for jobs is going to raise the cost of living, and that has nothing to do with taxes. second, people want to live where there is a good standard of living, so on top of jobs, California has things like better roads, education system, health services, etc, all of which are paid for by what? Taxes. So maybe in this part you do have point, except for the wrong reason, as your low taxes taxes are driving people away due to the low quality of government services. 

&gt;Again, I don't agree with the GOP on everything, and a good many of them aren't good people. but I can say the same of Democrats. Policy matters more to me than the fact the president can be a dick

No, the whole ""both sides"" does not apply anymore. You could use pre-Trump, but not now. Trump being a dick just adds to things, but I did not see Obama or Clintion (since conservatives love to compare them) add over a trillion dollars to the deficit in their first term, during a time of plenty.",1579880343,fffbk1k

1362,Stoics1,"Noam Chomsky:¬†I also said that it's an extremely outrageous statement. But the question is whether it's true. I mean, has there ever been an organization in human history that is dedicated, with such commitment, to the destruction of organized human life on Earth? Not that I'm aware of. Is the Republican organization‚ÄîI hesitate to call it a party‚Äîcommitted to that? Overwhelmingly. There isn't even any question about it.
Take a look at the last primary campaign‚Äîplenty of publicity, very little comment on the most significant fact. Every single candidate either denied that what is happening is happening‚Äînamely, serious move towards environmental catastrophe‚Äîor there were a couple of moderates, so-called‚ÄîJeb Bush, who said, ""Maybe it's happening. We really don't know. But it doesn't matter, because fracking is working fine, so we can get more fossil fuels."" Then there was the guy who was called the adult in the room, John Kasich, the one person who said, ""Yes, it's true. Global warming's going on. But it doesn't matter."" He's the governor of Ohio. ""In Ohio, we're going to go on using coal for energy, and we're not going to apologize for it."" So that's 100 percent commitment to racing towards disaster.
Then take a look at what's happened since. The‚ÄîNovember 8th was the election. There was, as most of you know, I'm sure, a very important conference underway in Morocco, Marrakech, Morocco. Almost roughly 200 countries at the United Nations-sponsored conference, which was‚Äîthe goal of which was to put some specific commitments into the verbal agreements that were reached at Paris in December 2015, the preceding international conference on global warming. The Paris conference did intend to reach a verifiable treaty, but they couldn't, because of the most dangerous organization in human history. The Republican Congress would not accept any commitments, so therefore the world was left with verbal promises, but no commitments. Well, last November 8th, they were going to try to carry that forward. On November 8th, in fact, there was a report by the World Meteorological Organization, a very dire analysis of the state of the environment and the likely prospects, also pointed out that we're coming perilously close to the tipping point, where‚Äîwhich was the goal of the‚Äîthe goal of the Paris negotiations was to keep things below that‚Äîcoming very close to it, and other ominous predictions. At that point, the conference pretty much stopped, because the news came in about the election.
And it turns out that the most powerful country in human history, the richest, most powerful, most influential, the leader of the free world, has just decided not only not to support the efforts, but actively to undermine them. So there's the whole world on one side, literally, at least trying to do something or other, not enough maybe, although some places are going pretty far, like Denmark, couple of others; and on the other side, in splendid isolation, is the country led by the most dangerous organization in human history, which is saying, ""We're not part of this. In fact, we're going to try to undermine it."" We're going to maximize the use of fossil fuels‚Äîcould carry us past the tipping point. We're not going to provide funding for‚Äîas committed in Paris, to developing countries that are trying to do something about the climate problems. We're going to dismantle regulations that retard the impact, the devastating impact, of production of carbon dioxide and, in fact, other dangerous gases‚Äîmethane, others.
Ok. So the conference kind of pretty much came to a halt. The question‚Äîit continued, but the question was: Can we salvage something from this wreckage? And pretty amazingly, the countries of the world were looking for salvation to a different country: China. Here we have a world looking for salvation to China, of all places, when the United States is the wrecking machine that's threatening destruction, in‚Äîwith all three branches of government in the hands of the most dangerous organization in human history.
And I don't have to go through what's happened since, but the‚Äîin general, the Cabinet appointments are designed to‚Äîassigned to people whose commitment and beliefs are that it's necessary to destroy everything in their department that could be of any use to human beings and wouldn't just increase profits and power. And they're doing it very systematically, one after another. EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, has been very sharply cut. Actually, the main department that's concerned with environmental issues is the Department of Energy, which also had very sharp cuts, particularly in the environment-related programs. In fact, there's even a ban on posting and publishing information and material about this.
And this is not just at the national level. The Republican Party, whatever you want to call it, has been doing this at every level. So, in North Carolina, a couple of years ago, where the Legislature, mostly thanks to gerrymandering, is in the hands of the Republicans, there was a study. They called for a study on the effect of sea level rise‚Äîon what sea level rise might be on the North Carolina coast. And there was a serious scientific study, which predicted, in not‚ÄîI forget how many years‚Äînot a long time, about roughly a meter rise in sea level, which could be devastating to eastern North Carolina. And the Legislature did react, namely, by passing legislation to ban any actions or even discussion that might have to do with climate change. Actually, the best comment of this‚ÄîI wish I could quote it verbatim‚Äîwas by Stephen Colbert, who said, ""If you have a serious problem, the way to deal with it is to legislate that it doesn't exist. Problem solved."" You know, this is going on all over the country.
And it's not just‚Äîit's not simply climate change. That's bad enough. But there's another huge specter that we're kind of trying to survive under, and that's nuclear war. That's a whole other story. Here, both the Obama administration and, increasingly, Trump are radically increasing that danger. This‚Äîthe threat of the new developments is captured very effectively in the best, simple monitor of the state of the world, established at the beginning of the nuclear age by the¬†Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. I'm sure you all know about this, but the¬†Bulletin of Atomic Scientists¬†regularly brings together a group of scientists, political analysts, other very serious people, to try to give some kind of estimate of what the situation of the world is. The question is: How close are we to termination of the species? And they have a clock, the Doomsday Clock. When it hits midnight, we're finished. End of the human species and much else. And the question every year is: How far is the minute hand from midnight?
Well, at the beginning, in 1947, beginning of the nuclear age, it was placed at seven minutes to midnight. It's been moving up and back ever since. The closest it's come to midnight was 1953. 1953, the United States and Russia both exploded hydrogen bombs, which are extremely serious threat to survival. Intercontinental ballistic missiles were all being developed. This, in fact, was the first serious threat to the security of the United States. There's an interesting story behind that, but I'll put it aside, unless there's time to talk about it. But then, it came to two minutes to midnight. And it's been moving up and back since.
Two years ago‚Äî2014, I think it was‚Äîthe analysts took into account for the first time something that had been ignored: the fact that the nuclear age‚Äîthe beginning of the nuclear age coincided with the beginning of a new geological epoch, the so-called Anthropocene. There's been some debate about the epoch in which human activity is drastically affecting the general environment. There's been debate about its inception. But the World Geological Organization has recently determined that it's about the same time as the beginning of the nuclear age. So we're in these two eras in which the possibility of human survival is very much at stake, and, with us, everything else, too, of course, all living‚Äîmost living things, which are already under very severe threat. Well, a couple of years ago‚ÄîI think it was 2014‚Äîthe¬†Bulletin¬†began to take that into account and moved the minute hand up to three minutes to midnight, where it remained last year.
A couple of‚Äîabout a week into Trump's term, the clock was moved again, to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight. That's the closest it's been since 1953. And that means extermination of the species is very much an‚Äîvery much an open question. I don't want to say it's solely the impact of the Republican Party‚Äîobviously, that's false‚Äîbut they certainly are in the lead in openly advocating and working for destruction of the human species. I agree that's a very outrageous statement. So I therefore simply suggest that you take a look at the facts and see if it has any merit or if it just should be bitterly condemned. That's up to you.

1559,freddyneverdies,"Legal costs: Almost all people who face the death penalty cannot afford their own attorney. The state must assign public defenders or court-appointed lawyers to represent them (the accepted practice is to assign two lawyers), and pay for the costs of the prosecution as well.

Pre-trial costs: Capital cases are far more complicated than non-capital cases and take longer to go to trial. Experts will probably be needed on forensic evidence, mental health, and the background and life history of the defendant. County taxpayers pick up the costs of added security and longer pre-trial detention.

Jury selection: Because of the need to question jurors thoroughly on their views about the death penalty, jury selection in capital cases is much more time consuming and expensive.
Trial: Death-penalty trials can last more than four times longer than non-capital trials, requiring juror and attorney compensation, in addition to court personnel and other related costs.

Incarceration: Most death rows involve solitary confinement in a special facility. These require more security and other accommodations as the prisoners are kept for 23 hours a day in their cells.

Appeals: To minimize mistakes, every prisoner is entitled to a series of appeals. The costs are borne at taxpayers‚Äô expense. These appeals are essential because some inmates have come within hours of execution before evidence was uncovered proving their innocence.

TLDR: the costs for trials involving the death sentence cost a lot more. Almost all death sentences get appealed and an overwhelming majority either get overturned to life in prison or the person winds up spending life in prison anyways waiting to be executed (therefore making the trial and expenses of the trial a waste of money)",1580025351,ffkmtmt

https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/10/two-decades-of-change-in-federal-and-state-higher-education-funding

The colleges aren't the bad guys because they're responding to market forces. As funding has shifted away from states paying for institutional operation to federal programs loaning to students, it's become more about selling students on attending so that they can keep their doors open. That means spending more on amenities than in the past and, because student loans are guaranteed to pretty much anyone with a pulse, this leads directly to an increase in costs which are then passed directly onto the students. Students who end up finding out that they were scammed by everyone in their lives telling them the only way they could be successful was to go to college.

Imo debt forgiveness isn't the way we need to fix this though (aside from programs that incentivise public service, or after so many years of good faith payments). It won't address the reasons that we got here. I think we (as a state) need to be offering 2 year colleges for free, provided that attendees keep a certain GPA/complete an apprentisceship. If you believe that you're college bound then you're halfway there. If not, use that time to get a trade, paid for by the state. Either way people are saddled with way less debt upon graduation (even trade school can cost a decent amount of money) and we have far more highly (and diversely) qualified workforce and can maybe work our way away from being one of the poorest states in the nation.

I appreciate your reply, and I appreciate the fight in you.  I am speaking from the heart of someone who is very active in following local, state, and national politics.  I have a very public job that encounters probably at least 100+ people a day, and most days, most of those people are not the same (healthcare).  

I engage in conversations pretty frequently about politics, because the political entertainment channels (CNN, Foxnews) are popular among the demographics I primarily encounter.  I will engage and talk to people about a range of politics and political subjects so long as it does not affect my job performance, or how they receive me when coming to do my job around them.  

Having said all of that, over the past several months when engaging in conversations - I have not encountered a time where they have brought up your name a single time.  I wish that were different, and that people see an alternative to Cotton, because I firmly believe he is a giant POS.  That does not give me a great deal of hope that you are hitting the general population you need to in order to make headway against a sitting Senator who won with a large margin over his incumbent opponent.  

I want to see you succeed.  You are whom I will be supporting with my vote come November over Cotton.  I like your platform and ideals for the most part.  You can check the timing of this post and look at your website for a donation that just was collected, as I did contribute while posting this.  

Please, please get out in any way you can because more people need to know that you are a viable candidate against Cotton, but at this point I cannot take back what I said - you are just not known as well as you need to be to the general public at this time.  I hope that changes and you walk away with a victory and become the next Senator representing this state, because Cotton is one of the driving factors in the (R)ussian party that is leading to the downfall of this great country.

The biggest problem is that, every year, hunters and trappers get rid of just enough (about half) of them to insure they can repopulate. Since their reproduction rate is about enough to double each year, unless something interferes, removing half simply means you have the same number a year later.

There needs to be an incentive to remove more than half of them, and the government needs to insure they don't interfere with that incentive.

1877,BrautanGud,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî Arkansas' surgeon general and church groups launched a campaign Thursday against recreational marijuana proposals that advocates hope to get on the ballot four years after voters approved medical marijuana.

The campaign is focused on urging people to not sign petitions circulating around the state for the two competing marijuana proposals. Supporters of the measures must submit at least 89,151 signatures from registered voters by July 3 and have their proposals' wording approved by the state Board of Election Commissioners to qualify for the November ballot.

Arkansas voters in 2016¬†approved¬†a constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana for patients with certain medical conditions, and dispensaries¬†opened¬†last year. Since then, medical marijuana sales in the state have exceeded $35 million.

‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is today, inevitably, we're dealing with recreational marijuana, just like we expected we would be four years ago,‚Äù Surgeon General Greg Bledsoe said at a news conference at the state Capitol.

The groups opposing the recreational pot proposals include the Arkansas Family Council and the Arkansas Faith and Ethics Council, which have filed paperwork with the state to campaign against the measures. Neither group plans television or radio advertising against the measures at this point.

‚ÄúWe're trying to reinforce our base, the grass roots, and reach those in the middle with compelling arguments,"" Larry Page, the Faith and Ethics Council's executive director, said. ‚ÄúIt's not necessarily a moral argument that might win them. It might be a quality of life argument.‚Äù

Republican Sen. Cecile Bledsoe, who organized the news conference, released a name of at least two dozen lawmakers opposed to the legalization efforts.

‚ÄúIt's too late if we wait until it's on the ballot. We need to start before that, encouraging people not to sign,‚Äù said Bledsoe, who is also the surgeon general's mother.

Melissa Fults, who heads the group campaigning for one of the recreational marijuana measures, said canvassers have gathered more than 10,000 signatures around the state. Fults said the measure would help people who have conditions that aren't covered by the current medical marijuana amendment or have been unable to get the product due to delays in some dispensaries opening around the state.

**‚ÄúWe want to get it out of the black market, out of the dark, bring it in to the light, create a whole new industry, create jobs and create money for the state,**"" Fults said.",1580425553,fg1e9sq

Preliminary estimates show that up to 20% of infections become serious enough to require hospitalization. In comparison, roughly 1% of common flu cases require hospitalization. 

The common flu virus shows symptoms quickly, allowing people to limit the spread. Someone can have 2019-nCoV and spread it for up to two weeks before they show symptoms. 

Despite China‚Äôs dramatic measures to contain it, the infection rate continues to rise exponentially (it doubles every six days). It has infected at least 20 countries and has already spread from person to person in a number of countries.

I agree 100%. That's why I posted this‚Äîto encourage folks to vote. Because for once, we have the option of choosing someone who isn't a crook. Bernie Sanders is an actual real-life good guy who has been consistently fighting for working class people for decades.

The fact that the Democratic establishment fought so hard to keep Bernie from being the nominee in 2016 should tell you all you need to know‚Äîhe's not one of them, and both parties see him as a threat to their corrupt ways. Which he is, and he proudly embraces that fact.

He has always refused to take money from large corporations and billionaires, because he refuses to be beholden to their interests like the rest of Washington. But he's been doing record-breaking fundraising with small donations from far more individuals than have ever donated to any candidate before, ever. He is truly for the people, not for big business and Wall Street.

He wants to get money out of politics, money out of for-profit healthcare, money out of the pockets of billionaires, and invest it in providing improved healthcare, education, and fair, dignified working conditions for *all* Americans, not just the rich and powerful.

If you're interested in learning more about Bernie, I'd encourage you to head over to /r/sandersforpresident. Bernie's huge movement is built, in large part, of people like you‚Äîpeople who felt the political system had nothing to offer them, before now.",1580536518,fg5rtmu

This is done each every year to fund the school system along with other county projects like paving rural roads. Property tax is the only tax that funds the schools. Income tax goes for state projects and sales tax to many different state and city projects.

About 6 months ago, I commented on a YouTube video of him responding to ""Leftist Hate-Filled Posts"". I told him how extremely unprofessional and overwhelmingly disturbing it was that he bashes and degrades constituents of his on social media who do not share his radical views. I told him that many of his constituents are frustrated with his repeated attempts to shove his religious beliefs down our throats, as well as his attempts to draft his personal views into ridiculous laws.

**I reminded him that he was elected to uphold the constitution, not the bible**, and that people have every right to be upset with him for prioritizing his extreme religious beliefs over his constituents' best interests (healthcare, education, etc).

At least, any of the politicians I've been made aware of. I am a lefty, generally, but I don't automatically hate Republicans. I actually like Rick Crawford, for example, even though I disagree with some of his policies. 

Jason Rapert, though, has forced me and the members of almost every secular group across the country to come together to fight him for over 4 years now. It's ridiculous, and tiring. To put it into perspective, if he were Muslim, he'd be fighting to establish sharia law. But since he's Christian, he's just been trying to slowly establish mosaic law one step at a time. After every step he makes to accomplish his goal, he goes out of his way to change Arkansas law to make sure the same rules he used to get what he wanted can't be used by someone else to get what they wanted.

He's THE worst person in Arkansas politics. If he changes to the Democrat party tomorrow, I would consider becoming a Republican just because I don't want to be part of anything he's associated with. 

Im probably going to move out of the state this year, one of the things im most excited about is not having him in the government in the state in which I reside. 

I don't think there is a politician in America that's worse for the first amendment than Jason Rapert.

2677,ApplecakesMcGee,"So if you tax everyone at a flat 15%, the most common proposal, you put a higher burden on lower income earners. It‚Äôs a regressive tax, like a sales tax, as opposed to a progressive tax, like our graduated income tax brackets. Example, someone makes 50k, they keep 42.5k after the 15% is taken out. If someone makes 200k, they have 170k left after tax. The difference that 7500 makes to the lower income family has a larger impact on their life than the 30k impacts the life of the person keeping 170k. 7500 a year is 625 a month, that could be a car payment or daycare or rent in a better school district. That money is also much more likely to be recycled back into the economy. The person keeping 170k has all their needs met, and many wants, or they‚Äôre horrible at budgeting or have a crippling gambling problem. Progressive taxes also generate more. Tax both at 15%, and you generate a net 37.5k in tax revenue. Tax 50k at 14% and 200k at 16% and you generate and you generate 39k. Go 5% and 20% and you have 42.5k in tax revenue, a 2500 vs 40000 mix, and you let the person making 50k a year keep an extra 10k a year. That 10k in the hands of a person living off 50k a year is more likely to be spent back into the economy than the higher income individual keeping it where it is more likely to be saved or invested, which then loses future tax revenue by turning income to capital gains and not stimulating the everyday economy, just Dow Jones points.",1581300918,fh6ld9s

""Under Obamacare, most people must have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. For 2017, the penalty is $695 per adult (up to a family maximum of $2,085), or 2.5% of household income, whichever is greater. The penalty for children is half the adult rate ($347.50).""

Penalty for Not Having Insurance
Up until 2019, you had to pay an additional tax (2.5% of your adjusted gross income) if you didn't have health insurance for at least nine months out of the year. The Trump tax plan later eliminated the tax.

https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/how-can-i-avoid-an-obamacare-tax-penalty-in-2019

In the past if you went without Obamacare-compliant health insurance for more than two consecutive months during the year, you were sometimes subjected to a significant tax penalty. According to healthcare.gov, the penalty for 2018 (paid when you filed 2018‚Äôs taxes in 2019) was $695 per adult or 2.5% of your taxable income ‚Äì whichever was greater!
Since the Affordable Care Act (the ‚ÄúACA‚Äù or ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù) became law, a lot of people have learned about the uninsured tax penalty the hard way ‚Äì by paying it.

That is yet to be determined, we'll know in November. What we now have is a disturbing precedent has been made: election interference is no longer considered impeachable going forward. Republicans should not have any problem in the future with the solicitation of foreign powers for disparaging information on political rivals in return for monetary authorizations. That is where we are. 

In light of this new reality I suggest we dispense with the process of constitutional impeachment. If this POTUS' specific behavior is not a concern then I am hard pressed to imagine a scenario more indictable. We can forego checks and balances in our 3-tier government system and permit the Executive Branch to reign supreme. This is in effect changing the highest office to more of an authoritarian dictatorship in character.

Under this new form of presidential authority I do expect further attacks on freedom of the press as a result. And the Justice Department will move from its traditionally independent agency role to one that places a priority on defending the actions of the president. Transparency will of course have to suffer as a consequence. Obstructionism will rule the day.

This may be fine for current supporters of this administration but when a different political ideology assumes the reigns in the White House the same authoritarian tactics will also be equally unpalatable for them. But hey, we all agreed to this new ""banana republic.""

 If you are in Northwest AR I like Devil's Den.  It is a decent campground with great scenery. You're also close to Fayetteville which is a fun college town that should appeal to a young couple. 

Central AR I like Petit Jean State Park.  That is about an hour from Little Rock, but to me it has a feeling of being far from any city.  

If you like lakes then look at the parks around Hot Springs.  You'll also find touristy stuff to do in Hot Springs.  You can easily spend a day in Hot Springs touring the bathhouses or the other sites (my family always makes a point at stopping at fat bottom girls cupcakes they are good!). There is also a casino if that is your thing.  Personally I prefer the horse racing there but it all depends on what you like.  

If you are looking for something a little different you can check camping at the crater of diamonds state park and dig for diamonds (that you can keep).  It is either dirty or muddy work so to me it was fun for a day but that's about it.

Bobby Gibbs, 40, is accused of threatening to blow up Walmart while inside the store Monday morning.

When officers approached him just before 10:30 a.m., they say he opened fire, shooting and wounding Lt. Eric Varner and Det. Eugene Watlington. Authorities said the officers returned fire, killing Gibbs.

St. Francis County Sheriff Bobby May said Gibbs had a ‚Äúlengthy‚Äù criminal record, including drug offenses. But May said there was nothing in Gibbs‚Äô record even approaching violence.

In 2012, he was arrested after refusing to turn down his music. During that arrest, officers discovered a gun that was reported stolen.

In recent years, Gibbs‚Äô cousin, Anna Jones, said Gibbs struggled to find work and moved in with her.

He had no taste or smell for about a year or two and his vision would sometimes fuck up. Plus he has brain permanent damage at 17. 

There was never any resource officer at our school but our teachers handled things pretty well. My point is sometimes kids don‚Äôt care. 

I‚Äôve also seen three guys beat up one guy throw him on the ground and stomp on his face with their boots. It was all where the teachers couldn‚Äôt see until it was too late.

ÔøºPolice tape

A Bigelow woman faces multiple felonies including a charge of first-degree murder after authorities say she admitted Monday to killing a man in Perry County and trying to burn the evidence.
Sandra Rappold, 22, is also charged with arson, abuse of a corpse and tampering with evidence, according to an arrest report from the Perry County Sheriff's office.

Authorities responded around 5:45 a.m. Sunday to a house fire at 59 Riveredge Acres Road in Bigelow.
Law enforcement on scene saw what they believed to be blood on the ground near a burn pit about 75 feet from the home, the report states, as well as blood on beer cans and an outdoor sink.

Deputies also found three 5-gallon containers of what smelled like diesel fuel.
Authorities learned during the investigation that a man had information on a victim in the incident, Steve Fason.
The man said Rappold told him she had ""killed the b**** and put him in the dump,"" according to the report. He also said when he went to the dump, he saw the body under some tires.
Authorities said in the report they found Fason‚Äôs body in the dump under old carpet padding and tires.
Investigators interviewed Rappold on Monday. According to the report, she said she killed Fason sometime late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, then tried to burn the evidence, set his house on fire and moved his body.
Fason‚Äôs cause of death and his connection to Rappold, if any, were not detailed in the report.
Rappold is being held at the Perry County jail in lieu of $1,000,000 bail.",1581481018,fhdaifm

3009,Hannyu,"60k isn't even upper middle class. Hell these days its barely middle class.

I notice dealing with older generations this is one of the biggest barriers to making them understand. They still think $30,000 a year is a good paying job. No, 30k a year is basically fucking poverty for a family. And their generations only needed one income earner for thr vast majority of society at the time, thats no longer the case, which incurs more expenses like daycare that used to be a nonissue by having a parent stay home.

And honestly, you're no better off at 50k than 30k, because at 30 you can get food stamps, medicare (or medicade whichever, i can never keep them straight), WIC, etc as a family. At 50k those things are still so expensive you can't really afford them and come out significantly better than 30. Not in the way you would think an extra 2/3 of your income would make a difference for sure.",1581489997,fhdl2ln

STONE COUNTY, Ark. ‚Äî Stone County, Ark. is home to one of the, if not the most glorious cave systems in the United States. The Discover Arkansas team made the trip to check out Blanchard Springs Caverns.

The trip through Stone County has one thinking they might be in another country. The mountains and curvy roads were a sight to behold. Once at the caverns, the team met with US Forest Service members, Trey and Aaron, who serve as tour guides to thousands of guests, year-round.

Visitors will have the opportunity to embark upon a couple of tours. The first is a guided tour through one of the most majestic ‚Äúrooms‚Äù of anywhere. The commercial tour takes place on a concrete walkway, with no steps throughout the entire exhibit. Guests are permitted to use wheelchairs and strollers, but be warned: the walk is by no means flat, so bring your muscles if pushing a wheelchair or stroller. It could be a good workout!

Giant features are viewed during the tour, with amazing echos and acoustics. Such good acoustics lends itself to making this location an occasional concert venue. Seats and lighting have been strategically placed for guests to enjoy the venue.",1581556695,fhg1yc6

3080,MadSciK,"Oh, rural ""broadbandification"" did start several years ago. It just hasn't progressed all that fast and I doubt it will speed up any, regardless of the recent grants. This sort of stuff gets political. Utilities have similar problems if they're provided by a small municipally owned entity. The town I grew up in didn't get touch tone dialing until 1996 and the municipal water office didn't get its first computer until a few years later, they couldn't afford it without a grant and the mayor didn't think they needed one until he got one.

Vehicle licensing and registration shouldn't be different from county to county, but there have been some changes the last few years as the online systems have expanded so some information sources may be outdated. Especially random individuals who haven't had to set foot in a DMV or assesor's office in years, like me.

I don't know where in TN you're from so I can't speak to soil differences. I think Heber is in the hills enough that rocks are likely to be an issue, and assorted clays are often present. Areas that have been pasture before development may have a good 6"" of actual soil, other areas may have half an inch of leaf litter over limestone, sandstone, or shale.",1581559680,fhg6g87

One of my favorite things to tell people is this. Our government and media since 9/11 are always trying to scare Americans with Radical Islam, Muslims, Al-Qaddafi, ISIS, Taliban, Iran, and basically any brown middle eastern people. All those are threats to Americans. However, since 9/11, including the attacks, more Americans have been killed by Americans than any other group, race, or type of people. In fact it‚Äôs not even close. 

I used to laugh about Benghazi. 4 Americans died and Republicans acted like it was the worst thing ever but in the same year something like 12,000 Americans were murdered with guns by other Americans. To me it‚Äôs crazy how many people don‚Äôt know or understand this.",1581583360,fhgxa0v

It's this intense narrative that the NRA and a lot of extreme right wing media are pushing that you need to constantly be armed and ready to get into a firefight. It just gets people amped up and constantly on edge. Combine that with the 'stick it to the libtards' set who like to open carry just to shove their beliefs in people's faces and there are a lot of people carrying guns in public for reasons that aren't really justified. I have more respect for concealed carry people who have to go through training and get licensed.

* 1.) A Wall - Obama, Clinton, Schumer, and the rest of the lifelong democratic Congressmen all voted to build a big strong double barrier full length border barrier in an effort to prevent people from sneaking into our country without permissions. This was the Secure Fence Act of 2006. They are all so terrible, nothing significant ever was completed and there wasn't much to show. Sure, there was a wall, but it was a crappy wall and very limited. Trump comes along stating the same thing, but the difference is he is such a strong and determined man, he is the only one that can actually fulfill the big large border wall that all the dems wanted. Just like he said, ""one way or another"", he's making it happen. Well over 100 miles built right now and progress is not slowing down. It's incredible to me watching such an amazing man come in and get things is weak predecessors tried and failed at. Back to the point though, if there is a wall, people can't sneak in, therefore, the need for these excessive and large detainment centers will drop like a rock in water. Clearly, there will still be a need for them, but it will be significantly less, as the number of people being detained will drop to a minimum.  
* 2.) Immigration Judges - There's been so many people sneaking in or claiming asylum with without merit, that the immigration process has been swamped and backlogged. To help detained people get processed and out of there quicker, the Trump administration [hired](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-announces-department-justice-s-renewed-commitment-criminal) more judges to work these cases. Clearly that's not an optimal solution, but it helps get people out of there faster.

3282,BrautanGud,"""Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he‚Äôs hopeful that the U.S. Supreme Court will review the case.

‚Äú**Arkansas implemented a work requirement in order to help recipients get worker training and job opportunities while receiving benefits,‚Äù Hutchinson said. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to understand how this purpose is inconsistent with federal law**. The court‚Äôs ruling undermines broad public support for expanded health care coverage for those struggling financially.‚Äù

Medicaid is a $600 billion federal-state program that covers about 70 million people, from pregnant women and newborns to disabled people and elderly nursing home residents. Under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, states gained the option of expanding the program to many low-income adults previously ineligible. More than 12 million people have gained coverage as a result."" - AP

Look, any of what I am going to say next may come off as condescending.  I don't mean it to be.  I'm only trying to inform, here.

You are far more misinformed about government budget than I am.  It's not your fault.  We've been lied to about the deficit, and about how it really, really matters by Republicans.  The cold hard truth is that Republicans are far greater drivers of deficit than Democrats.  The only time the deficit matters is when it's Democrats that do it.  At least that's the only time Republicans crow about it.

Where do you think this debt comes from?  Who do you think the government is paying for this debt?  It's American citizens.  Government bonds are debt, but they're things that citizens buy as investments.  People LOVE bonds, because they are a safe, secure, and guaranteed, although low, return.

The national debt and the deficit aren't bad, per se.",1581782432,fhp5hxg

3294,Awesomesause1988,"Yes, but then there's Treasury Bills and Notes  (not bonds); which are ""Printing Press Money""; and which the Federal Reserve purchases OUT OF THIN AIR. 

They artificially expand our money supply with a few keystrokes on a computer and WHAM $1 Trillion magically appears.  Only some of the debt is but by traditional bonds, most of it is what they call ""Biot"" treasury bills. Before December 23, 1913, your scenario is completely right everything was bonds, our money was connected to gold, we had sound money.

Ever notice why prices inch up little by little, year after year? It's because the government prints the money and calls it  inflation. The inflation isn't as bad as in Venezuela right now, but eventually it will get to that if we have to print say 15 trillion extra dollars to pay for a program. 

It would be the same if a helicopter flew over your neighborhood and drops $500,000 cash into everyone's backyard. The very first person to get to the Cadillac dealership that morning with the money is going to pay regular price for a Cadillac, but by, say, 11 AM that Cadillac is gonna cost $500,000, because all of the other Cadillacs have been sold.  There's simply more money chasing the same amount of Cadillacs. This entire theory is what economists call *The Helicopter Theory*.  

This is also A MAJOR REASON why the rich get richer in this country, because they're the *first* to get the money when the government prints and inflates it. By the time the ""big guys"" have spent that money and it trickles down to the little guys, the money isn't worth as much because it's been circulated around, so the little guys get hammered by this.  

The word ""inflation"" simply means an expansion of the money supply, it doesn't even mean rising prices, altho inflation usually does result in rising prices. 

How does this tie in to the debt? The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to put the brakes on not only rising prices, but inflation. When the government circulates an extra $15 trillion (financed by the Fed), the inflation that results is met with interest rate hikes *by* the Fed, the government isn't going to be able to pay for the $15 Trillion, in fact the government's going to have a difficult time *just paying the interest* on the debt, not the honest interest (the one you described, that does finance a certain percentage of the debt, but only a small one), but the Bankster fraudulent federal reserve fiat money interest.  

Every time the government needs money, and don't have a surplus, which they haven't had since Bill Clinton was president, mind you. He was actually the last president to balance the budget. But every time government needs money they go to the federal reserve and the federal reserve says ""yes I will print you the money!""

3297,chunkystyles,"You have some very strange ideas about inflation.  There is nothing inherently wrong with inflation.  In fact, a low level of inflation is good for the economy. 
 No inflation or deflation would be bad, and would slow things down.  The Fed targets %1-2 yearly, which will not get us to Zimbabwe-level inflation.  That kind of inflation doesn't happen under normal circumstances.

&gt; It would be the same if a helicopter flew over your neighborhood and drops $500,000 cash into everyone's backyard.

This is a horrible analogy.  The reason the rich get the money is because of the credit system.  Rich people have much higher access to loans, which is where that ""out of thin air"" money goes.

&gt; the government isn't going to be able to pay for the $15 Trillion, in fact the government's going to have a difficult time just paying the interest on the debt

No one wants this.  No one wants the government to pay the debt.  They want to keep their investments, and they want their interest.  If you went out and bought a bond you intended to keep for years, and the government suddenly repaid it, leaving you with no investment.  Would you be super happy about that?  Well, you might, because you have some strange views on the economy.  But normal investors wouldn't.  They'd be pissed.

&gt; But every time government needs money they go to the federal reserve and the federal reserve says ""yes I will print you the money!

More importantly Russia didn't get any of that Uranium. Because of course they didn't. They are not allowed to have our nuclear material. They only got the profits from mining it because they paid to own the company who mined it.

3445,Strongy,"The websites he pulls up to support his claim are:

Metro.co.uk - The website for a free Tabloid newspaper that seems to be mostly celebrity Gossip and soap opera recaps.

The Sun - A notorious British tabloid on par with the National Enquirer in terms of just making shit up and publishing any crackpot theory they think will sell papers.

t-online.de - An entirely German website, and homepage of the German parent company of America's T-Mobile.  I found the article he references but doesn't even attempt to read beyond the headline, and used Chrome's built-in translate on it.  It all boils down to the theory of a guy name Botao Xiao, whom the article states was unable to provide any reliable evidence.

Googling that guy's name, it is mostly right now about his Coronavirus theory, and only appears on British Tabloid newspapers like The Sun, The Daily Mail, and Metro, and some personal blogs - mostly conspiracy blogs.  If this Newsguard Addon has those sites showing as trustworthy, then the Newsguard addon is absolutely worthless.  The articles, and Beanie Man, talk about how the lab is only a few hundred meters from the fish market, when Cotton himself says it's miles away, and some people are saying as many as 20 miles?  I can't find a definitive answer about how far away it is from the market, and the proximity is the entire crux of the believability of this story. 

But let's get to the main matter.  Those news stories are making out like Tom Cotton went on the air and promoted or at least put forward a theory that China was manufacturing a virus, and it got out.  But then they quote him and his words just say we can't trust China and need to investigate.  So I watched the interview I think all these recent articles are talking about(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytGIkcCh7T8), and I learned Cotton apparently said Coronavirus is ""worse than Chernobyl"" which I guess, okay, technically.  A lot of things are worse than Chernobyl; I think less than 100 people have died from the Chernobyl so far, maybe a lot more eventually will from the long-term effects of the incident.  But so far, a plane crash would count as worse than Chernobyl.  The fact that most Americans just know it as ""scary Russian disaster"" and Cotton's invoking it in this situation hurts his case that he's not trying to use panic as a political tool.

The interviewer on Fox brought up the fact that the Chinese said the idea (specifically his idea, although I can't find whatever original clip they're referring to) of the virus being manufactured for the purpose of Biological warfare is just scare-mongering and Cotton responded ""The burden of proof is on them.""  Which is not how accusations work.  He doesn't deny or downplay the claim that he proposed the virus is a form of biological warfare, he just said China isn't trustworthy.  That means he actually did propose that, or he doesn't seem to care all that much that China thinks he did.  And then they move on and just talk about how China has bungled the situation, while also throwing in some shade about the China Phase 1 trade deal.

I can't find any original interview or press conference where he might have implied Coronavirus is a biological weapon.  Just an older interview where Tucker Carlson looks constipated and questions why the impeachment proceedings are on the news and not just the Coronavirus.  Cotton goes on to say that in the grand scope of history, the virus story will be a bigger story than the impeachment.  You know, like how Swine Flu, Bird Flu, and the West Nile Virus are all individually more remembered than ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman.""  I think Will Ferrel's impression of Janet Reno is more widely remembered than those pandemic scares.

I guess there's a possibility that this whole thing turns into the movie Outbreak, at which point Tom Cotton will be proven right.  But if it turns out like every pandemic scare that I've lived through in my really-not-that-long life, then Tom Cotton's statements will be remembered as either scare-mongering or a political attempt to distract from the Impeachment that he got stuck defending after the impeachment was over.",1581982731,fhysfgb

Im local to the area you went through and we have seen a large increase in trucks driving through Boxley Valley and I am guessing it is due to GPS routing.  The reason i bring this up is we have had 2 major semi wrecks in boxley valley just in the last several weeks, one of them deadly, because as I am sure you know, any direction you go out of the valley is up, so trucks are constantly crashing at the hill below the turnoff for Kingston, as well as the bottom of the hill coming into Ponca.",1582031381,fi09w9t
3494,Nostalgia-blvd,I was coming from green forest on my way to Russellville.  I don‚Äôt remember which roads specifically though.

Thankfully there were signs for trucks so that calmed my anxiety a bit but the curvy and hilly two lane roads through there can be pretty sketchy at times.

The DFA has absolutely nothing to do with issuing ""mandatory schooling""  You may or may not be required to attend a hearing once points reach a certain threshold to plea to them why they shouldn't suspend privileges, but schooling is only offered via the courts as a means of fulfilling probation to not get the points on your record in the first place.",1582039495,fi0l6sg
3512,yankeefoxtrot,"This is the best answer.  Having dealt with Rose Bud before, and listening to several attorneys' dealings there, here are some interesting take aways:

1.  Have a friend that got cited for possession.  He got an attorney naturally, and entered a plea.  Once the plea date on the ticket passed he get a letter from DFA informing him that his licence is suspended due to FTA in Rose Bud.  When his attorney called to check in the clerk simply ""lost"" the plea filing and said something to the effect of ""well we really aren't used to people pleading not guilty here.  I'll give you three guesses to the outcome of that case after his attorney got done with them.


2.  Upcharging to Reckless on conviction.  Several cases of people going 20 over and just getting cited for Speeding, only to have the judge there try to tack on Reckless once they plea guilty.  You cannot do this.  Also there is no such law that states that anything over 20 is an ""automatic"" Reckless,  It is a cause to cite for Reckless.

Simply put: Rose Bud is a shithole court, as is the entirety of white county.  Lawyer up if you think shit is fishy and you will be fine.",1582040226,fi0mcxj

3528,aviciousunicycle,"Bears are very much natural here. We used to be known as the Bear State due to our large bear population. It was the fur trade and bounties placed on ""dangerous"" animals like the black bear and red wolf that nearly did them in (and did do in the red wolf here in Arkansas). They were hunted to near extinction, which is the reason why we had to bring in bears from outside states. The process of bringing in individuals from another population and introducing them to a small native population isn't uncommon and is done with care in order to prevent a genetic bottleneck which would have led to unsuccessful bear reproduction and eventually full extinction within Arkansas.   

Elk were also native to Arkansas, though not the subspecies that we currently have. Arkansas was home to a population of eastern elk, which are unfortunately now extinct. The last native elk was killed in Arkansas in 1830. As with many states where the eastern elk once roamed, Arkansas brought in a population of Rocky Mountain elk, in hopes that they would fill the niche that once belonged to their antlered cousin.   
 
Believe it or not, the introduction of species by governmental agencies, especially onto public land and especially in the late 20th and now 21st centuries, is done with an extreme amount of care and consideration for the environmental impact that species will have on the environment.",1582045995,fi0w5j4

A night security guard had the bad luck of driving her golf cart into a small sinkhole that collapsed, and that was what revealed the forgotten crypt - and kickstarted the whole thing.

Right now, the goal is to have the archaeologists study the area, figure out about how many are actually buried there (we have no information at all, even at the school's museum), and eventually move the bodies to a quieter part of the campus since they're still part of the school's unique history.

yesterday

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî Arkansas‚Äô attorney general on Wednesday sued a Hot Springs woman, accusing her of taking part in a multi-million dollar scheme that defrauded people who were falsely told they had won a jackpot or lottery.

Attorney General Leslie Rutledge sued Jean Butler, 74, who she said acted since 2017 as a ‚Äúmoney mule‚Äù and received money from victims of the scheme who were told they had to pay taxes or fees before receiving their prize. Rutledge said investigators estimated Butler opened numerous bank accounts to deposit money from the victims and facilitated the transfer of about $6 million to the operators of the scheme in Jamaica.

The victims were usually seniors or other vulnerable people and never received the promised prize, Rutledge said. A phone number was not listed for Butler.

‚ÄúMoney mules like Butler who help scammers take advantage of Arkansans and people across the country must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,‚Äù Rutledge said.

Rutledge‚Äôs lawsuit seeks restitution for victims of the scheme and a $10,000 fine for each violation of the state‚Äôs Deceptive Trade Practices Act. She also asked a judge to require Butler to cooperate with any additional law enforcement investigations into the scheme.",1582210692,fi6yxih

3670,BrautanGud,"BATESVILLE, Ark. ‚Äî Students at Arkansas college are buzzed about learning to brew beer while living in a dry county.

Lyon College is offering Fermentation Sciences. It's a class that teaches students the process of how beer is made.

Behind every ice cold beer is an intricate process to get the taste just right.

""You're not measuring alcohol; you're measuring the difference in sugar,"" Dr. Alexander Beeser told students.

Dr. Beeser created the specific class to get students more interested in science.

""If you can find something that students already have an interest in and use that as a hook,"" Beeser said. ""If I can get students saying, 'I want to take this class,' as opposed to, 'I have to take this class,' I think it just makes for a better class.""

Students taking the unique, hands-on course said it keeps them interested, as it is not your typical college science course.

""It's fun,"" student Tommy Maloney said. ""It's different than anything else I would get to take at most schools.""

The course explains everything from measuring the sugar to how the ingredients blend together to get your favorite tastes.

According to staff, Lyon College is the first small liberal arts school in the state to offer the course.

Dr. Beeser said although Lyon College is in a dry county, there is nothing wrong with making your own beer, and students are not selling their finished product. However, students have to be 21 years old to take the course.

""We do not consume anything in this lab,"" he said. ""Even in cases where we could, we don't.""

Some of the students taking the course said this is an eye-opening experience.

""It forces you to expand your boundaries and learn something about it,"" Maloney said. ""I didn't know anything going into it, but I've learned so much in just the couple weeks that we've been here.""

Dr. Beeser hopes to expand the class next year and hopes more non-science majors will sign up.",1582297468,fiabeek

On Friday, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology put out a  directive titled: ‚ÄúInstructions on strengthening biosecurity management  in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel  coronavirus.‚Äù

It turns out that in all of China there is only one such lab, the [**New York Post**](https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/dont-buy-chinas-story-the-coronavirus-may-have-leaked-from-a-lab/) writes. ‚ÄúAnd this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. the epicenter of the epidemic.‚Äù

&gt;That‚Äôs right. China‚Äôs only Level 4 microbiology lab that  is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National  Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  
 What‚Äôs more, the People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs top expert in biological  warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of  January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.  
 According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching  coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and  anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of  Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in  all of China.  
&gt;  
&gt;The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the  Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the  lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they  unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing  authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems  with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.",1582431909,fij0qmc

Four counties, including Cleburne, Benton, Scott, and Independence have already proposed ordinances or resolutions designed to protect second amendment rights from¬†red flag laws.

""We‚Äôre not declaring any rights except that we will defend the constitution and we will defend the rights of the people, and we are being responsible to our constituents,"" Independence County Judge Robert Griffin said.

violent social protests in Chile cut

Griffin says the Independence County ""Second Amendment Resolution"" will protect the county's individual rights only if state legislatures were to pass a law that goes against the constitution. He has faith that the Arkansas Supreme Court won't let that happen.

""I cringed at the thought that there were people declaring themselves sovereign from their state, sovereign from the laws of the state,"" Griffin said. He believes counties, like Scott County, that pass ordinances declaring autonomy violate section 12 of the Arkansas Constitution, which states, ""No power of suspending or setting aside the law or laws of the state may ever be exercised, except by the general assembly.""

""Having an ordinance stating that you're going to do that would just be wrong,"" Griffin said. But to calm the fears some Independence County residents had about their right to bear arms, Griffin knew the second amendment resolution had to happen.

""Is it necessary? No. Is it redundant? Yes. Is it needed? It depends on your constituency, and we did have those that wished to see something done,"" Griffin said.",1582556806,fin6bh9

&gt;After consultation with Josh Bridges, the Election Coordinator for the Arkansas Secretary of State‚Äôs office, the ShieldWall Network will be passing out the attached flyer to voters outside several selected polling places throughout the state on primary election day, particularly targeting our initial demographic of young, blue collar White males.

&gt;These venues will be the perfect place to find recruiting pools of politically motivated potential SWN affiliates, especially conservatives and populists who may feel they wish to hold their noses and vote for Trump‚Äôs re-election as the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù. The ripening of such like-minded persons to the right is accelerating, and we will take this opportunity to make them aware of another option aside from the ballot box.

&gt;In compliance with our stated agreement with the Secretary of State‚Äôs office and the law, no flyers should be passed out within 100‚Ä≤ of the polling place‚Äôs doors.

&gt;Look for SWN Phalanx members passing out these educational flyers at your local polling place on March 3rd, or feel free to make your own copies to distribute.

If you see one of them within 100 feet of the polling place door, take a picture or video and report them to the Election Commission.

People tend to be ignorant on this point, but the House UnAmerican Activities Committee was initially convened by a congressman from New York named Samuel Dickstien.

It is a *fundamental* assumption of policing, that police have to have the respect of the community as neutral arbiters of the law, officers who enforce the law without favoritism. Civil policing cannot function without the respect of the community.   This is exactly why agencies tend to show they cannot tolerate officers who show they are biased against one or more groups in society.    Not only do they impair their own potential performance and become less effective officers, they impair the performance of the entire agency by damaging its reputation and credibility.

&gt;First, put down the thesaurus. You clearly are using words you don't have a clear grasp on.

You should help me identify the words you believe I've misused. That would be sooooooooo embarrassing for me. 

Beyond that, what you're telling us is that you're a former prosecutor who trains police. You say that police agencies typically do not tolerate officers with white nationalist viewpoints. 

I believe this. There's an LGPOA for LGBTs and there's an HPOA for hispanics and a NBPA for blacks, but no police association for representing the particular interests of white officers. If there were, it would logically follow that the purpose of the association were to manifest bias against the other groups? 

In any case, it's a comfort to hear a former prosecutor who trains police officers stipulate that further evidence would be required to prosecute an officer for political crimes than the word of a political organizer informing his activists that he has the names and numbers of 'which' officers to ask for if they have to call in a crime being committed against them. I can think of a dozen scenarios in which the word ""which"" in that sentence indicates something less dire than your fever dream that the officers on their list are sleeper agents in a terrorist plot to hand out fliers. It's likely that the group were smart enough to forewarn the local PDs of their planned, constitutionally-protected activities and secured assurances from whoever they contacted that responding officers would handle the situation impartially.  

But, as a former prosecutor who currently teaches criminal justice, I have to ask: would the word ""which"" in that sentence have been sufficient cause for you to open an investigation on an officer?

Your post is amazing in general, but this is one of my favorite sentences I've encountered recently.  It really is a treasure.

*Pretensions*, meaning ""claims,"" in standard American usage means a claim TO something, not a claim OF something.  It is often used with the negative connotation that it is a false, inflated, or delusional claim.  You can have pretensions of refinement-- a good example would be tossing words-of-the-day into your social media posts in which you attempt a lazy pivot from a conversation about a violent white nationalist group into an angry tangent about a Soviet asset from the 1950's-- a tangent doubtlessly meant to disarm the people who don't like the violent white nationalist group and to put them on the defensive.  You **cannot**, however have pretensions **that** ""All Cops Are Bastards.""

Comrade, you're a literal Stalinist crossposting from a gun-obsessed communist sub with a Soviet military badge as its logo. Have some self-awareness. 

&gt; right-wing extremism represents the greatest terrorist threat of violence in the United States.

You don't have a credible source which supports this. You have the ADL, which has falsified its data, including a series of hoax bomb threats against Jewish community centers perpetrated by an Israeli as an ""85% increase in antisemitic incidents"". At the link, they even indicate that they had to bend their criteria to include ""incels"" in order to make the numbers pop. Delving into the 17 incidents they attribute to ""rightwing extremists"", you find they employ an exceedingly loose criteria. Two of them have black perpetrators. None were perpetrated by or in the name of a political group. 

Common to all studies which make this claim, they lather it up from individual crimes, and the vast surplus of them are crimes to which the ideology of the perpetrators was incidental. If a schizo kills his parents because he's a schizo, the schizo's internet search history doesn't transform the murder into ""political terrorism"". If it were so, we'd be talking about The Rising Threat Of Transgender Terrorism because of the Colorado shooting (9 dead) or ""antifa"" terrorism (the perpetrator of the Dayton shooting was a member of the far-left John Brown Gun Club). Similarly, inmate violence perpetrated by members of white prison gangs which only exist in prison are not political and are not ""terrorism"". The Bloods and Crips are racially-exclusive criminal gangs with their foundations in 1970s political groups, but we don't count their violence as ""domestic terrorism"". 

Only by miscounting individual, non-political crimes and employing casuistic language in defining criteria do they manage to pluck out forty or so of the 7000 murders per year and present them as representing ""73% of extremism-related violent incidents"" or whatever. 

Think of how absurd and counterintuitive this White Scare meme is. Does any actual data point to whites being particularly violent? According to FBI crime stats, whites are 2.5 times less likely to commit even hate crimes than blacks.",1582596343,fip25gh

4037,BrautanGud,"EUREKA SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî An Arkansas cemetery will continue allowing individuals or groups to place Confederate flags on grave markers unless a family member of the deceased objects, despite complaints the flag is a racist symbol.

Eureka Springs‚Äô cemetery commission approved an amendment earlier this month also requiring anyone wanting to place flags or plaques to get permission from the cemetery superintendent, the¬†Arkansas Democrat-Gazette¬†reported.

Glenna Booth, a member of the commission, said the amendment was her idea.

‚ÄúI just tried to come up with something that would be fair to everyone,‚Äù Booth said.

Susan Tharp, chairman of the commission and acting superintendent of Eureka Springs Cemetery, said she hasn‚Äôt heard from anyone about not wanting any flags on the graves of a family member.

Kathy Attwood, who wrote the commission a letter, questioned why the flags are displayed all year long.

‚ÄúFor over 20 years I have been walking through our cemetery to reflect upon the beauty and peacefulness that it provides, but with each walk, I have become aware of something troubling,‚Äù Attwood wrote to the Independent. ‚ÄúFor anyone visiting our cemetery they will find a growing collection of Confederate flags scattered throughout and placed beside various tombstones.

Attwood wrote that she had family members who fought for the Confederacy, ‚Äúbut I would never adorn their monuments with a flag that stood for slavery and white supremacy. It was a way of life that was wrong.

Gloria Stevens, sexton at the cemetery, said there are about 47 Confederate veterans and 97 Union veterans among the 4,600 burials there. She said the cemetery was established in 1889, so none of those veterans died during the Civil War.

Koltin Massie has been putting Confederate flags on the graves of Confederate veterans in the cemetery. Massie is camp commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization dedicated to insuring that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved, according to its website.

Massie approves of the amendment. ‚ÄúWe can all compromise and be respectful of each other‚Äôs differences,‚Äù he said.

Massie said the flags are about history not white supremacy.

‚ÄúWhen we put the flags up, we‚Äôre doing it solely to honor the service of the veterans,‚Äù Massie said. ‚ÄúIf they fought for the South, they get a Confederate flag because that‚Äôs who they fought for.‚Äù",1582642605,fiqenlj

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission are working together to investigate the death of the eagle.

Wildlife officials said the eagle was initially examined by veterinary staff at Cross County Veterinary Clinic in Wynne, where the preliminary cause of death was determined to be a gunshot wound.

The eagle will be taken to the wildlife forensics lab for more testing. A reward of up to $5,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the shooting.

An initial reward of $2,500 was offered with an additional $2,500 being offered by the Arkansas Game and Fish Foundation.

Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the AGFC‚Äôs Stop Poaching Hotline at 800-482-9262 with all calls kept confidential.

The rotary at the south side of that bridge has 12 various lanes into and out of the rotary.  There have definitely been a couple of bad accidents on that rotary but the two that come to mind both involved large trucks/tractor trailers whose distracted driver's didn't slow down sufficiently for the traffic which had slowed to enter the rotary.  In the summer the traffic at that rotary can back up for MILES but if there were an intersection there it would be much, MUCH worse.  The cars slow down to around 25 miles an hour to enter the rotary but the speed on that section of road is 40.  Cars whizzing through there at 40 miles per hour are much more dangerous than cars going 25 through the rotary.  Plus, we have the benefit of having had rotaries for a very long time so people around her navigate them just fine.  It's people who haven't yet mastered the skill which make them more dangerous.  Given time, people will become more adept at using them effectively.  Also, rotaries are drastically cheaper to build and operate so for towns they make way more financial sense.

Complete parasites of society, the lot of'em. They offer nothing, produce nothing, create nothing. In fact, they are the enemy of creativity and free thought.

If you go into the data the United States government has never collected more than 18% of the nations economy as tax revenue, it never changes whether taxes go up or taxes go down, and always have hours around 18%. Yes ‚Äì sometimes it's 17.7%, sometimes it's 18.1%, etc. but it's always around 18% they've never been able to get more than that as a percentage of the economy in tax revenue, in 120 years (prior to that it was a much smaller percent). 

But again, why should we have an income tax? The wealthy are always going to write the laws because the senators from each district are going to appeal to their donors and what not. The corporations are just gonna move their selves to other countries or start shell companies. 

How is it moral, if I don't agree with something and I don't even want the service, shouldn't I be able to opt out of Social Security and not get my income taxed for that, or free healthcare and not have my paycheck deducted for that?

There are plenty of rock outcropping and mini waterfalls to explore. The Quachita Trail also crosses Brown Creek road so y'all could hike some of it to explore by simply pulling over to the wide spot in the road.

For camping, you pretty much have to chose between views or proximity to water. The reliably flowing creeks are often 800-1000' below and a few miles from the scenic ridge tops.

I train out on those forest roads basically every weekend and have logged/noted a ton of points with my watch/phone as I go, so I'm happy to DM you some coordinates of good camping spots/swimming holes.

If you give them yours from the beginning, they may start out with a skewed opinion of diagnosis that may not be correct.

4440,smeggysmeg,"I'm using an installer. Things to look for in installers:

* How long do they guarantee their labor? Will they help take them down and store them if roof work is needed?

* Do they guarantee your power usage offset? Will they pay you the difference if your system's output doesn't match (via linear scale over time)?

* What is the parts and performance guarantee on the panels they install? Are they rated for high winds and hail?

Another thing to consider is whether they have another revenue stream other than solar, because when the tax credit expires I expect fewer residential installs to be occurring and if the money slows down, the solar installer may take their profits and shut business. If they're doing corporate installations of solar, that might be enough. If they also operate in a related industry like homebuilding or roofing, that's a good sign.

There are a lot of pop up solar installers that offer significant savings but their panels won't survive Arkansas weather and their company will disappear as quickly as they appeared. Reputable name and sizeable footprint is important for a long term investment.

Also, the cheaper installers will try to sell you on a  string inverter, which is perfectly fine if there is absolutely zero risk of shade at any time of day, but if there's even the tiniest risk of shade it either needs optimizers with the string inverter, or micro-inverters (which are more common in the US with high quality installs).

It may or may not make sense, both technically or financially, to target for 100% offset, and any installer should be honest on what kind of offset you can achieve - and what they're willing to guarantee. 

Don't lease! Either buy or get a solar loan.",1582952102,fj2s13t

Except for a few limitations placed upon them by federal laws like the ADA, landlords in Arkansas are basically given carte blanche to do as they like the tenant be damned.

The attorney general‚Äôs website included a page with ‚Äútips‚Äù for tenants. What did their tips boil down to? ‚ÄúBend over and hopefully your landlord won‚Äôt fuck you.‚Äù

The things that I would personally really like to see outlawed are the ridiculous ‚Äúdamages‚Äù that landlords and management companies carve out for themselves in leases. For instance, in their leases Lindsey stipulates that 3 months of rent payments will due as ‚Äúdamages‚Äù if someone breaks their lease. If Lindsey has a new tenant in the apartment that was vacated within the month (which they usually do) they should not be entitled to zippidy do da.

Also there‚Äôs those ‚Äúnon-refundable deposits‚Äù that are not represented as sub in Lindsey leases. Like the deposit section will say ‚ÄúDeposit is refundable‚Äù but the  there will be another section that says ‚ÄúCharges for painting and new carpet will come out of deposit.‚Äù Tenants should not be responsible for painting and carpets if no damage was caused.

Unfortunately it is very hard to avoid having to enter into these types of agreements because of the relative monopoly Lindsey has on rental properties in NWA. The few other rental management companies in the area are not much better.

Personally I have now resolved to only rent rooms from homeowners and not apartments especially Lindsey apartments. I feel on much equal footing to negotiate a mutually beneficial lease with a single homeowner as opposed to a duplicitous corporate rental management entity.",1583065591,fj6b69p

4604,hdbaker009,"I watched a video from a reputable doctor on this. I‚Äôll add my two cents. 

This virus, also known as COVID-19 is in fact a very contagious virus and you should take preventable measures such as washing your hands and staying out of contact with infected people (whether it be this virus or another) obviously. 

But here‚Äôs the thing: the fatality rate of this virus is very mild (according to this doc) especially in otherwise healthy individuals. People are recovering. It is not a death sentence. Of course there are people who are not recovering as well but look at the flu and it‚Äôs impact. Remember when Ebola was a huge ordeal back in 2014 (I think that‚Äôs the year). Now that is a virus with a fatality rate of 50% or more. Deadly virus. COVID-19 is about 8% according to research. 

And the main reason the numbers have risen on infected people is because they‚Äôve declined testing every individual who‚Äôs showing symptoms of coronavirus. They‚Äôre basically just diagnosing them with it if they show the symptoms as those who have been truly tested for it. 

Take it as you will. Don‚Äôt read too much into the fear and for the love of God wash your hands and don‚Äôt touch your face! Wash your hands after you‚Äôve touched a gas nozzle, a door handle, the piece of trash you picked up, the car handle, the handle of the sink, etc. Because when you touch your face, those pesky germs float their way into your membranes from your eyes, mouth, and nostrils then next thing you know your throat is scratchy and you‚Äôre gonna be wishing you didn‚Äôt pick your nose after you stopped to get gas.",1583101843,fj7zobl

4606,BrautanGud,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî An Arkansas man who had previously been found guilty in the death of a bicyclist has been acquitted after he had appealed his original conviction and was retried.

Justin Van Smith had been found guilty in May by a Little Rock judge and sentenced to 10 months in jail in the October 2017 death of 30-year-old Vincent Lynell Tio Jackson.

Smith, 48 appealed the verdict and the case was sent back before a jury last week in Pulaski County Circuit Court. Jurors acquitted him on Thursday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette¬†reported.

Prosecutors had alleged Smith had been driving a big rig in Little Rock which was dangerously overloaded when it struck Jackson. Smith was trying to pass Jackson but got too close, authorities said.

Smith‚Äôs lawyers, Will Wisdom and Lisa Walton-Middleton, told jurors Jackson‚Äôs death was a tragedy that Smith could not have prevented. Smith‚Äôs lawyers criticized the police investigation, alleging it was based conjecture with no scientific basis.

Or you end up with situations like Texas and Chile, where the flags are similar enough to confuse non-Texans and non-Chileans.

North Central Arkansas:

""The Syllamo Mountain Bike Trail is a series of interconnecting loops offering the mountain bike enthusiast¬†50 miles of trail, much of it single-track.

The trail name dates back to an 1800s resident of the area. Eventually the name was anglicized to its current form - Sylamore (SIL-a-more). You'll notice all the tributes to Syllamo in the area - Sylamore Ranger District, Sylamore Creek, North Sylamore Hiking Trail.

The various loops can be accessed from four different trailheads as well as Blanchard Springs Recreation Area and Campground. Three trailheads are on Green Mountain Road; the fourth is on AR Highway 5 North.

Several parts of the trails have a variety¬†of difficulty - stretches that are pleasant for a beginner, then stretches where a beginner would be wise to walk a bike. Trails are marked with various color blazes on brown fiberglass posts. Remember to wear your safety gear and enjoy the ride.""

https://www.news18.com/news/tech/face-masks-coronavirus-answering-the-big-question-why-you-shouldnt-ignore-a-protective-layer-2525287.html

You Didn‚Äôt Know This About COVID-19, Did You?

""And here is what we know about the Coronavirus virions. The New England Journal of Medicine released a report which suggested that scientists were at a consensus that the diameter of the 2019-nCoV particles varied from about 60 to 140 nm‚Äîthat means as small as 0.06 microns all the way to 0.14 microns. The virus particles had quite distinctive spikes, about 9 to 12 nm, and gave virions the appearance of a solar corona. The research was done on Coronavirus patients in China and funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China.

**This makes it is clear, even the largest Coronavirus virions are smaller than the particles that most N95 and N99 face masks can filter out‚Äîwhich is 0.3 microns. So, there you have it then, stop buying face masks and that‚Äôs that? this is what they do.**

The 2019-nCoV particles varied from about 60 to 140 nm‚Äîthat means as small as 0.06 microns all the way to 0.14 microns.

Here is How Face Masks Work; You Probably Didn‚Äôt Know This Either

The typical N95 and N99 masks are designed to keep airborne particles, pollutants, viruses and allergens out, as you breathe in air. You may have also seen a lot of people wearing what look like surgical masks and walking along on the street or in public transport. The thing is, surgical masks are actually designed for the opposite‚Äîto keep any droplets or pathogens from a doctor‚Äôs respiratory system from escaping and touching any surface nearby or infecting a patient. You wear a surgical mask on the street, and it will make no difference, unless you are infected‚Äîand that way you could protect others. But would you know. These surgical masks should be worn by anyone who already has a cough, cold or sore throat, till they are tested either way for the COVID-19 infection.""",1583687936,fjy1hu8

5209,BrautanGud,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî The Arkansas Department of Human Services is requesting double-digit pay increases for direct-care workers at state institutions for the developmentally disabled in hopes of retaining the employees.

The department‚Äôs proposal includes five human development centers where pay would increase about 18%, from $22,000 to $26,034, the¬†Arkansas Democrat-Gazette¬†reported.

Pay for supervisors would also increase almost 12%. Currently direct-care and support staff members all make the same starting pay.

Part of the proposal would also offer free training for all employees to become certified nursing assistants and require the direct-care staff members from all five centers to achieve the certification by the end of the year.

**The proposed changes in salary increase are in hopes to reduce the annual turnover that currently averages more than 100% across the five centers, said Melissa Stone, director of the department‚Äôs Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.**

**‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having an enormously hard time just keeping people from leaving because it‚Äôs hard work,‚Äù Stone said. Considering ‚Äúyou can get paid that same hourly rate to work at a fast food restaurant.‚Äù**

The turnover also affects patients as they need consistent staff to know and be familiar with their needs.

Pay increases and training still need to be approved by the Legislature, which would cost an estimated $4.7 million.

Stone said her division is able to pay for the salary increases and training without increasing its annual budget due to cost-cutting measures at the centers",1583846643,fk3ukhm

5231,Camusforyou,"Lost Valley trail outside of Ponca for a nice, easy hike to a waterfall.  Then I would suggest camping at Steele Creek Campground on the Buffalo River, about a 15 minute drive from Lost Valley. You will likely have neighbors at the campground this time if year, but if it's the first time you've ever camped, that would be a nice spot to try it out. If you decide you like it, you could later venture to primitive campsites outside of traditional campgrounds. Then in the morning, head over to Jasper for an early breakfast at the Ozark Cafe. 

For gear; nice hiking boots with wool socks, maybe some trekking poles (which are great for balance, as well as clearing spiderwebs and low hanging branches), lots of water, a trail guide (Tim Ernst has a great series of guide books for Arkansas trails), some light snacks (granola bars are good, but pack out what you pack in).  I also like using Avenza Maps on my phone to plot out trails and keep track of my route (you can use this offline if you download the maps ahead of time).  There are many other options as well other than Avenza Maps, so just find one you like.  Some are free(ish) and some cost a few bucks.  Also always a good idea to carry a small med pack with things like Band-Aids, gauze, wraps, and moleskin.  All of this would be overkill if you were only just hiking the Lost Valley trail, which is only just over two miles and is an easy path to follow, but it's a good list anyways. For even longer hikes, the list can grow. 

For camping, I assume you have a tent, which is fine for two people. I personally like hammock camping, which is quicker and easier to set up and take down, as well as keeping me off the ground. However, other than a tent and sleeping bags, if you are camping in the next month or two, you will want to dress warmly (it will get quite chilly at night). Bring a flashlight, or even better, a headlamp (Black Diamond make good ones).  If sleeping on hard ground sounds off-putting to you, you can also bring a sleeping pad.  Some people insist on having a pillow.  Also, camping chairs are always a good idea, as is a pair of comfy shoes for winding down around the campfire. Speaking of, if you plan on having a campfire, check ahead of time that a ban burn isn't in place for that county. You can usually pick up a bundle or two of wood from gas stations on your way up. 

Most importantly, leave no trace and respect your surroundings - to people and nature alike. Have fun whatever you do and wherever you go!",1583888803,fk5vrty

The convention center was once bustling and even hosted Razorback hoops. 

Automation in timber and agriculture, reduced demand for some timber products, combined with manufacturing moving overseas has devastated the local economy. Crime rate way above the national average. Unemployment about 3x the state average, fourth in the state in poverty rate. 

Few years ago Main Street was blocked off because a vacant building had collapsed. City wasn‚Äôt having luck getting the owner to pay for clean up while the city pled inability to afford the work. 

Couple years ago I witnessed a car wreck. The drivers got their cars separated and both sped away. 

So now Pine Bluff gets perceived as post-apocalyptic hellhole. 

There‚Äôs a lot potential there if someone figures out a new economic niche for the city. Sadly I think local leaders are pinning too much hope on the new casino. They had attracted a marijuana grower/processor but they relocated to Newport before hiring anyone locally.

A nice easy, but longer hike is near Star City at Cane Creek State Park. The trail is six miles in and six back out. The trail is flat with some suspension bridges. There are shelters near the lake. The lake has beavers, so beware ""Beaver fever"" ad treat any water you take out. There is a back parking area that is a shorter hike in, but you still need to check in with the rangers.

5408,boo_hiss,"&gt; GREENBRIER, Ark. ‚Äî Two students at Greenbrier High School are being punished after they‚Äôre accused of bullying a classmate.
Superintendent Scott Spainhour says the student who was bullied had food thrown at them in the cafeteria Tuesday. 
‚ÄúThis was at lunch, in front of a group of students, so it‚Äôs especially bad behavior. He was trying to single this kid out and he was successful,‚Äù Spainhour said. ‚ÄúHe took some mash potatoes off his plate and either threw them at him, wiped them on him I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
Pictures and video from inside the cafeteria have been spreading on social media. Several pictures include captions calling the bullied teen homophobic slurs. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely disgusting behavior,‚Äù Spainhour said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely unacceptable. We had a brand new student new to our school new to our community and he was picked on.‚Äù
As posts about what happened spread on social media so did rumors. 
The mom of one of the two kids accused of doing the bullying, says her son is now being targeted online. 
‚ÄúThere should be zero tolerance for bullying,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe knows what he did is wrong. He was punished, he was punished at home and at school.‚Äù
The mom went on to say her son needs to learn from his mistake and not be attacked. 
‚ÄúHe wants to apologize, he knows he was wrong,‚Äù she said.

Do you think that banks are going to forgive mortgage payments?  Do you think they will hesitate to repo vehicles for missed payments?  People who are already struggling can be absolutely destroyed by this or any epidemic.   I called my child's school for options about them learning at home and they literally laughed at me.

Then those people take it back home to their own parents. Rinse and repeat 5 times a week. Even if only one kid started with it, and people spread it to one other person every other day you'd have 8 people after the first week, 64 after the second week (realistically when the symptoms in the first family might be noticed as sick with a 7-14 day incubation period). Then you think that every one of THOSE people might be spreading it outside of the school at their work, or the store (while everyone is panic buying lol). And meanwhile the disease keeps bouncing around the school because you can't tell who has it until after they've spread it around. 

 Whereas with schools closing, hopefully you have people actually practicing the whole social distancing thing. If a kids parents get sick, it stays in their house, hopefully, thus preventing a chain where more and more people get sick.

You are correct. All available data has children at practically zero risk of serious complications. Working age parents are at a very minuscule risk of serious complications. 

When school closes, kids will go to their grandparents house. Those grandparents are at highest risk.

And of course viral load.  A lower number of virus may mean your immune system beats it before it can ramp up.

&gt;  
&gt;The ruling, written by a Reagan appointee, said the administration  failed to show how such rules would help Medicaid to meet its mission of  covering the poor.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a  lower court‚Äôs ruling striking down work rules for Medicaid recipients  in Arkansas, casting more doubt over broader Trump administration  efforts to require poor people to work, volunteer or train for a job as a  condition of getting government health coverage.   
&gt;  
&gt;A three-judge  panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit found that approval of the Arkansas work requirement by the  health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar, was ‚Äúarbitrary and  capricious‚Äù because it did not address how the program would promote the  objective of Medicaid as defined under federal law: providing health  coverage to the poor.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe means that Congress selected to achieve  the objectives of Medicaid was to provide health care coverage to  populations that otherwise could not afford it,‚Äù Judge David Sentelle, a  Reagan appointee, wrote in the ruling. ‚ÄúImportantly, the Secretary  disregarded this statutory purpose in his analysis.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt;Concurring were Judges Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, and Harry Edwards, a Carter appointee.  
&gt;  
&gt; It  was not immediately clear whether the Trump administration would appeal  to the Supreme Court. In a statement about the ruling, a spokesman for  Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid,  said the agency ‚Äúis reviewing and evaluating the opinion and  determining next steps.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt;To  date, the Trump administration has allowed 10 states to condition  Medicaid eligibility for many poor adults on proving that they work or  engage in other accepted activities, like volunteering. But only  Arkansas had put its work rule into effect. The district court judge who  initially struck it down, James E. Boasberg of the Federal District  Court for the District of Columbia, also struck down similar rules in  New Hampshire and in Kentucky.   
&gt;  
&gt;The appeals ruling will  influence other cases heard in the District of Columbia circuit, and  could give further pause to states outside the circuit pursuing work  requirements. Many of the seven others that enacted such requirements ‚Äî  Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin ‚Äî  have voluntarily put them on hold while the court battles play out. The  latest rejection makes it all but impossible for the administration to  get work requirements in place anywhere before the November election.   
&gt;  
&gt;There  are outstanding lawsuits over work requirements in Indiana and Michigan  as well as in New Hampshire. Kentucky‚Äôs new governor, Andy Beshear, has  rescinded that state‚Äôs work rule.   
&gt;  
&gt;The Arkansas work rule led to more than 18,000 people there [losing coverage](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/18/694504586/in-arkansas-thousands-of-people-have-lost-medicaid-coverage-over-new-work-rule)  before Judge Boasberg blocked it in March, leading the Trump  administration to appeal. Even many Medicaid recipients who had jobs  there were either unaware of the rule or confused about how to report  their work hours to the state every month.   
&gt;  
&gt;The rules require  ‚Äúable-bodied‚Äù adults to report to the state every month that they have  worked, searched or trained for a job, taken classes or volunteered in  order to keep receiving Medicaid health coverage, which is largely free.  Ms. Verma has repeatedly said such activities can improve people‚Äôs  health and help them ‚Äúrise out of poverty and government dependence.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt;In  approving Medicaid work rules under a waiver program that allows states  to spend federal Medicaid funds in ways that would not normally be  allowed, Mr. Azar said the objective was to improve health outcomes.  Employment, he said, was ‚Äúpositively correlated with health outcomes.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt;But  the appeals panel noted that experiments approved under the Medicaid  waiver program were supposed to be ‚Äúlikely to assist in promoting the  objectives‚Äù of Medicaid. Mr. Azar, the panel ruled, had not done due  diligence to ensure Arkansas work requirements would meet that goal.   
&gt;  
&gt;In  fact, the ruling noted that when the work rule was first proposed, many  commenters expressed concerns that it would lead to people losing  coverage, but that Mr. Azar had not taken heed.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe text of the  statute includes one primary purpose, which is providing health care  coverage without any restriction geared to healthy outcomes, financial  independence or transition to commercial coverage,‚Äù the ruling said.

&gt;  
&gt;Work  requirements have long been central to the Republican goal of  instilling a sense of ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù in people who benefit  from government programs. Supporters of such rules for Medicaid  recipients have said that extending the safety-net program to millions  of low-income adults without disabilities, as the Affordable Care Act  allowed, gave them an incentive not to work.   
&gt;  
&gt;But a large portion of Medicaid recipients do already work. [According to the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-what-does-the-data-say/), 63 percent of adult Medicaid recipients without disabilities have part- or full-time jobs.   
&gt;  
&gt;As  part of a broader quest to reshape the Medicaid program ‚Äî which covers  more than 71 million people, or more than one in five Americans ‚Äî Ms.  Verma last month announced plans to [allow states to cap Medicaid spending](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-announces-transformative-medicaid-healthy-adult-opportunity)  for many poor adults, a major shift long sought by conservatives.  States that participate would have broad flexibility to design coverage  for those adults, who are also the population targeted by work  requirements.

There were a lot of sick (and elderly, simply because the population is a bit older than ours) people due to recent bouts with the flu and other illnesses. 

The real problem was that Italy was in a full blown crisis before they realized the virus had arrived. Not only were they not testing, they weren't aware they needed to start testing. 

It got transplanted into their country in mass by travelers who were, frankly, unaware the virus even existed, it then had a few weeks to seed and spread before the Italians became aware of it. 

While only about 20% of the tests we do are coming up positive, for quite a while most of their tests were coming up positive (I never got the exact number). This is why the number of cases in Italy rose so fast, sometimes by 200% or more per day. It wasn't that they had new cases, but that they were finding the ones they already had.

I hope I  am not coming across as argumentative here.  I just want to have explained to me how everything was average until February if there were so many cases. 

I am no doctor,   I just looked at the graphs of number of people seeking treatment.  I am sure there were a quite a few cases early that went undetected, but there were no more ""unknowns"" with ""negative flu and pneumonia tests"" than in any other year. may be at your Dr.  but not across the state, or  across the nation. There was no spike in the graphs.  Flu and Pneumonia and Unknowns were average until mid February.    Suddenly there were thousands of extra people seeking treatment for Flu and Pneumonia... what we now know is corona. 

 Where were all the serious cases and deaths before February?

I understand there are carriers,  but how can there have been thousands of people walking around with it,  with  so few getting seriously ill and going to the hospital that is doesn't make a spike in the graph.  They couldn't have all been carriers.

It may have been here a lot longer than we thought,  but it could have been wide spread and running wild like start to in min Feb.

02/29/2020 .....1 sample tested negative for flu this week.

The issue is that there are competing narratives. Most of the data comes from confirmed cases. To be frank, we just don‚Äôt know how many people have coronavirus. Evidence coming from China and now the US shows that the disease is mild or asymptotic for the VAST majority of people.  There‚Äôs a feeling among a huge number of people that when the dust settles and hysteria ends, COVID-19 will be re-examined as a disease far less serious to humanity than we were initially told.

The competing narratives is exactly why so many people are not following quarantine orders. No one knows what information to trust. On one hand you have some governments and WHO/CDC officials act like this is a big deal, on the other you have the President of the United States (and leaders like bosonaro and others) that say it‚Äôs not a big deal at all, that it is under control and the media is causing hysteria.

Then you see people freaking out and buying all the toilet paper and pasta sauce. The entire economy crash, thousands of people out of work. Lives upended.  Hysteria like it‚Äôs highly infectious Ebola for a disease that doesn‚Äôt cause severe illness for most everyone. 

People want to live their normal lives, and habits are hard to break. In a perfect world, everyone would start wearing masks, wash their hands 100 times a day, Clorox EVERYTHING, keep a safe distance from others, and individuals who are sick or high-risk would be quarantined.

Unfortunately, we‚Äôre realizing that we don‚Äôt live in that perfect world. Folks aren‚Äôt washing their hands. Surfaces aren‚Äôt getting disinfected. Virtually no one is wearing a mask. People are still hugging their loved ones, shaking hands with their pals, and then scratching their face or rubbing their nose. 


Because while this whole thing might be overblown and the hysteria has gotten absurd, 40 people at the same Little Rock nursing home have coronavirus. For every 10 people that think the hysteria is overblown but are still taking reasonable precautions, there‚Äôs that one jerk who is still snotting into his hand, partying, living life as normal, and spreading COVID-19 like he‚Äôs some god damn modern Typhoid Mary.

People will panic if national guard and other armed forces start roaming the streets along with drones and here in the south that could definitely get ugly.  I can easily see protests over it for sure, which invites conflict.

If you issue these kinds of restrictions then you have to be willing to enforce.  We aren't that far removed from Kent State circa Vietnam War.  That is still a huge scar for many.    But now we have drones and tracking devices on everyone.

You cannot be evicted for losing your job or thinking you might have hard times coming up. Landlord knows whether you paid the rent on the first or fifth or whatever. If you are going to get any grace from a landlord, it‚Äôs going to be because you got out in front of the situation with a plan on how to make everyone whole. Yeah big property managers like Lindsey aren‚Äôt easy to work with. But you are doing yourself zero favors by not communicating and just defaulting. 

Commercial and residential landlords are going to have a LOT of defaulted tenants over the next few months. There will be a high vacancy rate and downward rent pressure. I have advised several clients that they will be far better off working with tenants right now, especially commercial ones. If you own 100 commercial sites and 20% of your tenants are about to go belly up, that‚Äôs a ton of spaces to fill. You are much better off delaying rent or even discounting it for some just to keep as many paying tenants as possible. 

Add to this the fact that I‚Äôm not sure you can even evict anyone at the moment anyway. Our courts aren‚Äôt hearing anything other than felony criminal and emergency matters. If you sued to evict and the tenant doesn‚Äôt respond then maybe you can still get a writ of possession on default.

Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc have ALL been investigated, and they've ALL had opioid deaths for their patients, and there is a chance the Walmart script was just the last one so they get blamed.  Does it suck the pharmacists weren't heard? Yes, but this article didn't quote the number of complaints.  It could have been one per store, or it could've been a disgruntled employee.  I did programming on the new walmart pharmacy software that combines patient charts a little over a year ago.  There were more Walmart patient electronic charts than the population of the US.  Makes it a little hard to track the frequency someone gets meds if they have 5 charts in 5 stores that don't communicate with each other.

Question is does the study measure prescriptions or units. 

A person being treated for chronic pain who is prescribed 2 pills per day has to renew the prescription monthly so that‚Äôs 12 prescriptions per year and 730 units. 

A person with severe chronic pain who is taking 2 hydrocodone a day and 2 oxycodone per day has to renew each monthly and that‚Äôs 24 prescriptions per year. That‚Äôs 1460 units. 

While hospitalized for cancer treatment for three days two different times the three doses of hydrocodone per day was two prescriptions (one per admission) because they didn‚Äôt want me to use the prescription I used at home. So three right there. Between dental work required to start radiation, hospital admissions and what I was taking I was 8 or 9 prescriptions last year. Roughly 800 units. 

Some pain clinics are encouraging marijuana cards to reduce opioid use but if you work for the Feds or a number of other occupations you can take opioids and that‚Äôs ok but pot is a firing offense even having the card is firing offense if you never use it. If you hunt and someone burglarizes your home and you need a new shotgun you can‚Äôt legally buy it if you have a pot card.

8122,Cows-Go-M00,"Many ""Street drugs"" for opioids started out as legit prescriptions. That's why many states are looking into buy back programs for unused drugs. But even buy back programs won't help because people can get more $ per pill on the street than the government would ever offer.

But it also just depends on the geographic area. I used to work for the Texas health department so I'm more familiar with there - along the i35, through Houston and such, overdoses are more attributed to heroin, fentanyl laced products, drugs trafficked over the border. But when you look more rural, and in more affluent areas, prescription pills are a bigger problem. Just a supply thing. 

Anyway yes, support for addiction is the big thing we need. Lots and lots of people start off taking pills and then move to street drugs such as heroin to get a better, faster high. There's also the very real problem that a certain % of folks with no past addictive tendancies (ex alcohol) will take opioids prescribed for a legit reason and get addicted very quickly, within a couple weeks a physical dependence can grow (which is why nowadays people get scripts for only a week at a time) 
. We don't know who they are until it's too late. 

I highly recommend the two part podcast from Freakonomics about the opioid crisis from earlier this year. They talk a lot more in depth on how people get these drugs, unused pills stolen out of homes, and various programs groups are trying now to help those addicted.",1585248904,flkwc2j

So, you were still out.  Maybe these people felt like they just need one or two things and they will get back to the house.  Its really hard for me to understand how you people are so judgemental but doing the exact same thing as the people you are complaining about.  I can handle the down votes, bring em on.  What I am having a hard time dealing with is overt hypocrisy.

Like any other normal person I am trying to limit my interactions with other people.  I too have been in Lowes.  I have a friend whose water heater went out yesterday.  So I guess she should wait 15-20 days before going to Lowes or Home Depot to buy a hot water heater?  Or parts for a hot water heater?  Im not supposed to help with that?

Also, while in there, I noticed that while there seemed to be a lot of cars in the parking lot, people were spread out through the store fairly well.  The people in the plant section are spread out fairly well too and they are getting plants so they can spend time outdoors.  Hiking, biking, walking are all supposed to be ok, but digging a hole in your yard after relatively limited exposure to people in a spread out Lowes is somehow forbidden?",1585429202,flrwa28

The entire point of gloves is to avoid cross contamination, but you can only do that if you‚Äôre changing gloves after every transaction or task. Otherwise they‚Äôre useless. If there aren‚Äôt enough gloves going around for healthcare workers, why do people think retail workers have enough for every employee to change gloves between every customer? Wouldn‚Äôt you prefer someone sanitize or wash their hands between transactions? 

Like from an actual sanitation perspective, I would much rather someone without gloves serve me. Anyone whose ever worked healthcare or hell, even food handling knows that.

Viruses always burn out when either everyone is infected or it can‚Äôt infect any new people due to isolation or killing off its victims too quickly.  

I haven‚Äôt seen Cuomo‚Äôs press conferences in a while. 45% of hospitalized people in nyc are aged 0-45: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf

Most deaths in nyc are 45 and older, with 75+ being the biggest age group as far as mortality: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary-deaths.pdf

So he is probably talking about the elderly because it is mostly killing them. 

There‚Äôs no special reason young people are catching it other than lack of social distancing. Young people get the flu and the common cold the same as the elderly. Young people are being hospitalized due to their immune systems overreacting. The virus does what it does, but the immune system goes haywire and starts attacking healthy lung and immune cells. As the immune cells get destroyed and the protective cells in the lungs get damaged, that gives bacteria a chance to grow and that causes pneumonia.

I did my graduate work studying rabies spread in foxes (I also wrote a paper on aerosolized spread to spelunkers from bat guano- it happens, but very rarely). Specifically we were worried about continuing to drop rabies vaccines to them in edible pills. There had been some discussion about the virus mutating so quickly since it was an RNA virus that it would evolve beyond the approved vaccines. There was a cool study we read that found that replacing a single Amino acid in a strain of rabies made it unable to kill its host. The problem was, by introducing that change the virus became too unstable. So it couldn‚Äôt be used as a vaccine.

9019,embroiderythread,"One issue with it is that Cotton is deliberately using a term that no one else uses-- even Trump stopped calling it that, but he's insisting on using terminology that no one else really is using.

 First it was the Coronavirus, then it was a Coronavirus but we don't know which one, then it was SARS-CoV something, now it's Covid-19. It's a new virus so the official name has been developing as rapidly as the situation, but overall we can see that the generally accepted terms don't refer to China at all. They're referring to the virus, the family of viruses it is in, and the year it first jumped to humans. The name actually describes the particular virus, which it should, because, uh... that's what a name is supposed to do. These are fine names. 

 But Cotton is one of those who's backpedaling and using a name that isn't descriptive or specific, and it's not hard to see why. 

Calling it the China virus makes people hear you and think ""Yeah, this is China's fault."" There's a lot to be said about the Chinese government's response to it, and their constant human rights abuses outside of this issue, but we know this wasn't a deliberate ploy by the CN government (even if it is a result of them refusing to close wet markets). Those things just make them easy to blame them for this too. It detracts from the fact that how hard the virus hits us is going to be dependent in large part in how US legislators like Cotton react to it, which is great because if they perform poorly, their supporters will just blame it on China. Using that name just reinforces that idea. 

And again, because he's using a weird term that no one else is using, and many organizations have warned against, we can tell that he's deliberately signalling something to his supporters and constituents by using this term. Personally, I think that's the most concerning part of this.

ETA: Signalling is also pretty shitty in this scenario because, as others have said, it's very easy to speculate that part of the reason why China is such an easy target is because of xenophobia or racism. The thing about these implicit terms is that you can read whatever you want into it. Best case scenario, it's political finger pointing, worst case scenario, well...",1585591495,flxx51g

9039,chuckh8e,"I have learned to read, which is why I'm confused to you assertion. I am unable to find where the CDC and WHO called the virus that caused the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic ""North American Swine Flu""

I do see the term used when referring to general swine influenzas in North America and in passing when referring to the various viral strains that came together to mutate into novel H1N1. I found one link from the Navajo Nation that called it [""Human 2009 H1N1 North American Influenza""](http://www.h1n1.navajo-nsn.gov/downloads/H1N1_Vet_Flyer_12.2.09.pdf).  One link from [pork.org](https://pork.org) called it [""North American Flu""](https://www.montanahelp.org/From_NPB_site.pdf). But that was in reaction to pork producers worried the colloquial term ""swine flu"" would hurt their business.

&amp;#x200B;

Major diseases do sometimes use geographical markers. West Nile, Ebola, Rock Mountain Spotted Fever, Lyme Disease: those are all places. The CDC has pages dedicated to North American Flu Lineages, [such as this one](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/north-american-lineage.htm). But those names weren't political. That's what health workers called it before the actual infectious agent was determined, or it's what researchers use so they can differentiate different versions of similar diseases. One could even argue that ""Wuhan Virus"" was a colloquial term used briefly during the emergence of the disease, [like the US is doing](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/g7-coronavirus-statement/index.html). 

&amp;#x200B;

But the US is doing that only for political points so that they can point fingers at China instead of admitting that Trump's leadership led to what Foreign Policy called [the Worst Intelligence Failure in U.S. History](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-worst-intelligence-failure-us-history-covid-19/). The term ""swine flu"" wasn't created or used to intentionally hurt the pork industry. ""China Virus"" is squarely meant to blame China and the Chinese for the disease.",1585593037,fly00yu

9057,embroiderythread,"Oh gotcha. IMO it's just that while the name on its own doesn't seem bad, we know that using location based names is both pointless and has a ton of (presumably) unintended consequences... I've been seeing a lot of articles that are talking about how Asian Americans have been harrassed and many of them believed calling it the 'China' virus enabled that harassment. I believe that was actually the reason Trump gave when he tweeted about him not using the term anymore, too. Also, I haven't read about this myself, so take this with a grain of salt, but I've seen posts claim that the WHO and CDC's reasons for rejecting location based terms are based in the same logic: in history, it has caused a lot of completely avoidable bad behavior on the part of people who are xenophobic, etc..

So to someone decent (like yourself), it probably doesn't mean much, but unfortunately many people have their prejudices stoked by seeing terms like that. We have to acknowledge that people like that exist even if we wish they didn't, because otherwise you can't avoid harming minorities. 

They see the location in the name and blame everyone from that place for the virus. For someone who already is very prejudiced, they become afraid of people who look like they could be from that place, because they directly associate the virus and an unrelated person... and that fear causes a sizable number of shitty people to act out and harass others. It's happened before and it's happening currently. The name easily leads them to that path. 

 There's no target to blame if we all call it Covid-19, but when we're worried about the ""China virus"" taking over, the reality is that a lot of aggressive, stupid people will be discriminatory towards people they perceive as being Chinese. It puts a fixation on the location and not the virus, when the virus is the actual problem.


Tl;dr Sticking a location onto something bad that has people hysteric, confused, and scared easily leads to misdirected fear and anger towards people from that location. Many Asian Americans have already reported harassment directed at them for being Asian and because of the virus, which they have nothing to do with, and a lot of them are directly saying it's because it was called the China virus-- Chinese people became a target of blame. The problem is that in reality, many people will not interpret that term neutrally, even if it starts out as a seemingly neutral word, and we obviously want to avoid causing unecessary harm. It may not seem innately racist on the surface, but we know it will lead to racist acts, as it currently is.

Unless you are exhibiting life threatening syptoms such as fluid in the lungs, intense fever for days, etc, your best bet is to stay home and isolate yourself. As has been stated multiple times, there's no cure and most cases are not severe enough to require medical care. The most responsible use of the healthcare system is to only use it if absolutely necessary. If you're sick, isolate yourself and wait for your body to fight off the sickness.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî A Little Rock man accused of making the deadly toxin ricin will not stand trial because possession of the substance was not illegal when he was charged, a federal judge has ruled.

Alexander Joseph Jordan, 23, was scheduled for trial in June.¬†He was indicted¬†in March 2018 for possession of ricin without the legally required registration.

But U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. tossed out the charges on Monday because possession of ricin didn‚Äôt become illegal until July 2019.

‚Äú**The government should not be allowed to prosecute the defendant for conduct that was not made illegal until after he committed the challenged acts**,‚Äù Moody said.

Authorities got involved with Jordan when he called 911 from his Horseshoe Loop home to report that he feared he might have accidentally ingested ricin while mixing it, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette¬†reported¬†Tuesday. He wasn‚Äôt hurt by the substance, which can be lethal even in small doses.

Jordan told investigators in 2018 that he was inspired to make ricin by the television series ‚ÄúBreaking Bad,‚Äù in which a chemistry teacher makes and sells methamphetamine.

Jordan said he found the recipe on the Internet and bought the key ingredient, castor beans, from Amazon. He said he didn‚Äôt intend to hurt anyone but that he was thinking of suicide.

In his ruling, Moody said the 2019 amendment to federal law intended to criminalize the knowing possession of unregistered ricin ‚Äúat that time.‚Äù",1585693905,fm2b0a1

10080,BrautanGud,"""**Initial jobless claims in Arkansas for the week ending March 28 were 26,944, nearly triple¬†the amount reported in the previous week. Jobless claims nationwide totaled 6.64 million, an increase of 3.34 million from the previous week‚Äôs revised level**, according to Thursday‚Äôs (April 2) U.S. Department of Labor report.

Arkansas‚Äô revised total for the week ending March 14, according to the Labor Department, was 9,275, more than six times the 1,382 in the previous week. The increase in the state‚Äôs jobless claims has skyrocketed roughly 1,850% in two weeks.

The dramatic rise in claims is the direct result of responses to efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, which include the closure of non-essential businesses and social distancing measures that have essentially shut down many service sector and tourism-based businesses.

As of Thursday morning, COVID-19 cases in Arkansas stood at 624, according to the Arkansas Department of Health. That total has almost doubled in the past week. There have been 10 deaths and 45 recoveries in the state.

There were 216,722 U.S. cases and 5,137 deaths in the U.S. as of Thursday morning.

‚ÄúThe COVID-19 virus continues to impact the number of initial claims,‚Äù the Labor Department said in a statement accompanying Thursday‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúNearly every state providing comments cited the COVID-19 virus.

Historians suspected it started in Kansas, but that has since been debunked. Most historians and virologists of today believe it actually began in CHINA, and spread to France through Chinese workers sent there. 

But let‚Äôs talk about modern history. The Wuhan Virus isn‚Äôt the first major pandemic to come out of China in recent years. 

There was in Asian Flu in the mid 1950‚Äôs that killed between 1 and 4 million. 

SARS in the early 2000‚Äôs that killed over 700 people.

H7N9, or bird flu, which is on ongoing sickness the world is dealing with. 

Not to mention the Wuhan virus that is projected to kill thousands worldwide. 

No, we should give China a free pass. They shouldn‚Äôt be called out or made to take responsibility. Let‚Äôs just get through this so we can face the next pandemic that comes out of it in twenty years. Maybe our kids and grandkids will get through it unscathed and be stronger for it.

Because every day, citizens can see the number of dead, but also the number who have recovered. And, as of this point, we are winning: 2,335 people hospitalized with grave symptoms have recovered, compared to 1,809 who have died. And none of the¬†124,899 Italians tested¬†for COVID-19 has been charged a single euro.

Health officials said the number of people with coronavirus had risen to at least 643, from 624 the night before. An additional two people died from COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, bringing the total deaths to 12.

NO STAY AT HOME ORDER

Gov. Asa Hutchinson defended the state being one of a handful remaining that hasn‚Äôt issued some form of a stay-at-home order

State Democrats earlier Thursday called on the Republican governor to implement a broader restriction.

‚Äú**While our efforts so far have made some difference and have been well-intentioned, it‚Äôs clear that far too many people are disregarding guidance to stay home and avoid crowds,**‚Äù state Rep. Denise Garner said.

Local governments have implemented other restrictions but have said only the state can impose a stay at home order. Little Rock and at least two other cities are enforcing nighttime curfews in response to the outbreak.

Cities have taken further steps, including removing basketball goals and taping off playground equipment.

Asa has the gun lobby in his pockets. However, I think he is showing leadership in this time of crisis. Let me explain why I see it that way. 

Asa has not ruled out the possibility of a shelter in place order (SIP). He‚Äôs said that he wants to see more numbers on the effectiveness of SIP. According to the governor and the ADH, the number coming out of places that have sheltered in place are showing that it doesn‚Äôt have much effect. It‚Äôs important to realize how much of an economic impact SIP would have, and I recognize the fact that people are more important than the economy, but if it doesn‚Äôt help, there‚Äôs no point. 

This is also consistent with what‚Äôs coming out of the ADH. The ADH secretary, Dr. Smith, has said it‚Äôs not needed. The postulation that Asa isn‚Äôt listening to people in the healthcare system is incorrect. Arkansas is ahead of the curve, consistently. It‚Äôs been that way and it‚Äôll stay that way, and if it doesn‚Äôt the Governor will SIP.

While it probably would slow the spread of covid 19 I don't feel that a stay home order would stop it. Eventually everyone is going to catch it, the virus spreads too easily not to. Unfortunately a stay home order of too long is going to cause damage to the economy that won't be recovered from very quickly. Unlike fairy tale land that some people seem to live in, I'm from the real world where things don't exist because we want them... they exist because someone had to work for it. Even in a socialist government where theres free money all over the place theres still someone having to work to produce to provide for the needs of the population. While I fear my mother dieing from covid 19 I also fear the massive domino effect of economic collapse as job loss and dwindling government funds only cause the next round of workers to be laid off.

10651,PudgeHug,"Heres a crazy idea. If all the people who can withstand it get it now and avoid contact with those who can't. Once it passes we typically expect them to begin having an immunity from catching it again. That then slows the spread later on which will protect those vulnerable in our society more than a stay home order will. At this point lets say 100% of the population stays home a month. So yea everyone goes back to work, a few months later as it circulates around again do we once again stay home? Lets also add in that the US response was already delayed due to China withholding information and that theres not enough tests to do proper mass tests. I would be willing to put money on it that a great number of the population has already been infected just based on how it spreads. Then again I work in retail and I'm around thousands of people every week so maybe I just see whats around my own field of view. If this virus is truly airborne and just breathing can pass it from one person to another then I don't see how the entirety of the city I work in hasn't gotten it. 

I also want to add in this tad bit of a thought. What happened to the days when we accepted that at some point we would get sick so we put emphasis on eating healthy foods to strengthen our bodies?

&gt; This awful plague seems, according to early numbers, to target the elderly and those who have health problems already. But new research from Asian authorities shows being healthy isn't a guarantee against the disease. And, maybe even more frightening, young and healthy people might be carriers without knowing it.

&gt; It turns out that watching for people with symptoms of covid-19 isn't enough. Because folks who appear perfectly healthy, without so much as a cough, are still capable of giving the virus to others. Here's more from the Associated Press:

&gt; ""A study by researchers in Singapore became the latest to estimate that somewhere around 10 percent of new infections may be sparked by people who carry the virus but have not yet suffered its flu-like symptoms.""

&gt; It gets worse.

&gt; ""The seemingly healthy people who can transmit the virus are believed to fall into three categories: pre-symptomatic, who do not have symptoms when they spread [it] but develop illness a couple of days later; asymptomatic, who never develop symptoms; and post-symptomatic, who get sick and recover but remain contagious. The Singapore and China studies focused on pre-symptomatic infections.""

&gt; You've no doubt seen Facebook comments from folks who claim that this new virus kills fewer people than the flu, or who think they can tough it out. But this new research shows even if you do tough it out (whatever that means), you might still give the virus to someone else who will not be able to walk it off.

&gt; And that's why all this social distancing is so important. We don't have enough information about this virus yet to determine who is safe and who will for sure get sick--and require hospitalization.

&gt; So far, Gov. Asa Hutchinson has declined to issue a stay-at-home order for the state of Arkansas. He explained his reasoning yesterday at his daily press conference. The man, as always, made a lot of sense. (It's a habit of his.)

&gt; He said that stay-at-home orders aren't really stay-at-home orders, and if he issued one tomorrow, 700,000 would go to work come Monday. That is, even with these orders in other states, nurses still go to work, electricians still go to work, grocery store workers still go to work, lawyers and accountants still go to work. So how much good these orders are doing is anybody's guess.

&gt; And if he did issue his own order, thousands of others--at stores trying to stay afloat by paying employees to fill online requests--would lose their jobs. Gov. Hutchinson noted this isn't just a health-care crisis, but an economic one as well.

&gt; But he also noted that if his experts tell him to crack down even more, he will do so.

&gt; The most interesting part of the governor's conference yesterday, he pointed to a chart that showed the number of covid-19 cases as compared to what was expected for Arkansas. As things stand--with his social distance directive--the number of actual cases has consistently glided below the forecasts in this state. Which means, so far, what our state government is doing is right. Pray it stays that way.

&gt; In a remarkable turn of events, the governor of New York state asked for volunteers to help with the pandemic, and more than 80,000 people turned up. That includes health-care professionals from other states, folks taking a break between jobs, and recent retirees.

&gt; Recent retirees. Just because a body is retired doesn't make them elderly. But the over-65 set is the demographic that this virus seems to attack in force. And these people are volunteering to serve on the front lines in this war.

&gt; Remarkable. What a country. What a people.

&gt; The government in Great Britain has canceled Wimbledon for the first time since World War II.

&gt; The president of the United States said in a press conference this week that his nation is going to face a ""horrific"" couple of weeks. Starting now. We hope that's not just empty optimism. That is, we hope he's right and it's just a couple of weeks. And not longer.",1585917936,fmb4avx

From what I‚Äôve seen there have been a few covid cases in hospital. It‚Äôs hard to tell how many as the testing results take some time to get back. Seeing a lot of people short of breath and with respiratory infections. Majority are older but there are some who are younger. Not at capacity yet, but units are being shifted around to make accommodations for a surge they predict to be in the very near future. We are attempting to take measures on saving PPE now in hopes of not having issues with the spike of cases. I imagine that it will be difficult to acquire outside PPE when/if we get to that point since federal government is buying from Walmart and I imagine the priority of the national supply if any left is going to bigger and more impacted states. We are taking measures now and hopefully it‚Äôll pay off, but it will take more than us as healthcare to endure all of this.

All of this leads to a lack of maintaining their overall health because they are not maintaining things like their blood pressure or diabetes.

But if they HAD NOT gone into full on lock down when they did, how many new cases do you think they'd be having every day.   A lot fucking more than 4,600.  They are significantly limiting the number of new cases everyday by limiting how many people are exposed to each other.  This isn't rocket surgery, the more people who are exposed to people who have the virus, the more people will be infected.  If an insane number are infected all at the SAME TIME, then their healthcare system becomes completely overwhelmed by this.  Trust me man, I am a paramedic near Boston, Mass.  We're on day 25 and things are just now starting to significantly hit the fan and we went into a stay at home order March 24th...that's ten days ago, when we were only on day 15.  You're on day 18 in Arkansas and while you only currently have 550 or so known cases, you probably have closer to 10,000 as cases double every three days and those 550 cases are people who were likely exposed over a week ago.  550*2 = 1100, 1100*2 = 2200, 2200*2 =...you see where this is going.

Note that I do not necessarily disagree with you - I have been advocating for a total shutdown in this state and THE WORLD for over a month now.  The piecemeal approach to it in the US is just making me sad.  

Do you think AR's positive cases are way, WAY underreported?  Well I mean obviously they are - I mean we haven't been able to test anyone and I have read from several sources that you literally cannot get tested in this state right now unless you're presenting every single symptom and possibly you are a healthcare worker.  Quest labs are so backed up that they cannot get test results back to people sooner than 10 days.  I also read somewhere that the state is no longer actively monitoring circles of people who have come into contact with a positive case so.....

But also - how do you explain what is going on in NY right now versus CA?  NY seems that it must've been a complete mosh pit of COVID-19 transmission for many, many weeks prior to the realization of what was about to happen, while places in CA with very comparable populations do not seem to be doing ""too bad"" (I know that is a very weak statement, but......)

The virus is here. It‚Äôs not going anywhere. People are going to continually be infected with it until a vaccine is fully developed. 

Development on the vaccine just started. It‚Äôs projected to take anywhere from 6-8 months before completion. 

Meanwhile the infection rate is projected to plateau between late April and early June. That means people will continue to be infected at a steady rate, but one hospitals are able to deal with. 

The ENTIRE purpose of Shelter in Place orders are to slow the rate of infection so hospitals and medical centers aren‚Äôt overrun, and are able to treat patients effectively without a massive drain on manpower and supplies. 

Arkansas has no indication of its hospitals nearing capacity. Not even Big Baptist is reporting it‚Äôs nearing max capacity. 

With that in mind a Shelter in Place order here is pointless. It won‚Äôt be doing what it‚Äôs designed to do since we aren‚Äôt nearing capacity in our hospitals.

10933,omi_palone,"These are all good and fair questions. Stay safe out there.

*Do you think AR's positive cases are way, WAY underreported?* 

Yes. The math behind the rapid transmission is already showing us very clearly just how much transmission is driven by asymptomatic cases. No amount of spot testing for people who present with the clinical syndrome and hospitalization or quarantine of those cases will ever be sufficient to keep virus transmission in check. The only management strategy that's within reach right now--the *only* one--is limiting person-to-person spread by staying home and away from people outside of your own household to the greatest extent possible. 

*But also - how do you explain what is going on in NY right now versus CA?* 

Population density, plain and simple. It's much, much more difficult to keep out of range of the virus in NYC (66,940 people per square mile) as compared to, say, San Francisco (17,246) or Los Angeles (7,544). Also, SF and the bay area took (relatively) rapid measures to impose social distancing policies, closing nonessential businesses, closing schools and so on. These are great mitigating steps, but they are only mitigating the rate of transmission. What is happening in NYC is a window into how lack of early containment efforts lead to predictable outcomes: widespread, sustained transmission. It's immaterial in the long run that, say, Little Rock is less densely populated (1,576 people per square mile)--if people are still paying for gas at the counter, close to each other in grocery lines, eating together at picnics, worshipping together in church, you name it, transmission is unimpeded. [Arkansas currently has two of the top ten clusters of cases](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/content/us-covid-19-atlas) adjusted for population *nationwide* (Little Rock and Pine Bluff). 

*What is your personal opinion on comparing NY to CA, and also with AR's spread out population, lack of public transit and lack of attractions to draw much in the way of tourism*

The total number of cases will be lower in AR, without a doubt, but the rate of incidence of new virus cases is the relevant measure here. Arkansans are still moving about relatively freely. The state will see a slower peak in maximum number of newly diagnosed cases relative to NY or CA purely as a function of population density, but that's only capable of twiddling the rate of transmission. Transmission is still happening in AR in a way that hasn't been feasible in CA for more than two weeks, for example. 

In my line of work, states with leadership who aren't enforcing a strict lockdown policy are acting--in every sense--against scientific judgment, expertise, and observation. It's a really, really weird gamble that makes no sense other than short term political lockstep with you-know-who and his incredibly anti-science administration. It's a weird fucking flex, y'all.

A Stay Home and Shelter in Place order doesn‚Äôt provide legal standing for authorities to force people not to leave home. They are guidelines that are suggested for citizens to follow. 

Under the current model most States are using people are allowed to leave home to get food and other essential items from stores, seek out medical supplies, go to work if their employer is still calling them in, and go to parks and other outdoor areas for essential exercise. 

And **allowed** is a bit of a loaded term because it suggests you can‚Äôt leave home unless you are doing one of these things, which is false.

If not for the year it takes for the infection rate to die off then maybe for the 6-8 months it‚Äôs going to take to mass produce the vaccine that‚Äôs still in experimental testing?

Do you honestly think people are going to be content with staying home for the next 6 months? No. Eventually malcontents are gonna start cropping up and causing serious issues for law enforcement.

You also have law enforcement leaders in California, New York, and New Jersey going on the record saying people will not be pulled over for breaking the orders. 

Not to mention the President has said numerous times in his briefings and in interviews he would not declare Martial Law, and if any Governor tried to use the National Guard to that effect he would Federalize it immediately.

All that said, at the end of the day they are still just guidelines. People are free to put as much stock into following them as they do anything else that isn‚Äôt against the law. 

Should people stay home? If you don‚Äôt need to leave, probably. That still ignores the reason it exists. 

Shelter in Place orders are meant to slow the infection rate enough that hospitals can catch up with treatment of the infected. No hospital or medical center in Arkansas is nearing capacity. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs unnecessary. 

There is no treatment. There is no cure. Hospitals just alleviate some of the more dangerous symptoms until is passes through you. 

A vaccine won‚Äôt be ready for 6-8 months. People can‚Äôt be put under quarantine that long. Most Sociologist agree that after three weeks in isolation mental health begins to significantly deteriorate.

With that in mind there is no benefit for Arkansas to put such an order in place. Not when the infection rate is projected to plateau in late April to early June.",1585975954,fmdrs6k

Moreover, I have yet to see a good argument demonstrating that stay-at-home mandates (let alone guidelines) would be unconstitutional. This piece (https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2020/03/25/are-stay-at-home-orders-constitutional/#7c2c3033104e) does a good job sketching out the terms of debate. 

In many states, the guidelines have become more than ""soft"" rules. Plenty of counties and municipalities have begun enforcing stay-at-home orders via fines and penalties.

Most importantly, you are completely overlooking the fact that self-isolation is a proven method of combatting the spread of infectious illness (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/11/coronavirus-flattening-curve-quarantine-stop-spread/5021564002/).

11103,OKFisherman8,"TL;DR - Stay at home order and/or ordering non-essential businesses to close won't change much.  What Arkansans are doing is working.

No one is doing as they please.  Schools are closed, restaurants are closed, gyms are closed, park equipment is off limits, all sporting events are cancelled, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, you can't get your hair did, the Buffalo National River is closed, state park access is limited, and YOU CAN'T EVEN GET YOUR TEETH CLEANED!

What do you really think is going to change with a formal shut down or stay at home order?  People can still go to the grocery store, work at essential businesses and industries, and even walk down the street with appropriate physical distancing.  Walmart will still be open, gas stations will still be open, Lowe's and Home Depot will still be open, and these are deemed essential by federal guidelines.  About all that will close is Dillard's which for some reason people in this sub have a real problem with.

A week ago I thought we were headed into dire territory.  We should have had 1000 positives around 4/1.  On 4/3 we're at 738.  New infections aren't skyrocketing.  While this could be due to still inadequate testing, the number of hospitalized patients is at 71 for a system with a surge capacity of 5000-6000.  While our 12 deaths are tragic it should be noted that 11 Arkansans died of the flu just last week.

What we are doing IS WORKING to restrict the spread of the virus as well as any other state.  This probably has as much to do with luck as management; but for whatever reasons we aren't nearly in the same category as Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, or Texas.

11138,Ohgodgethelp,"I hope you don't mind me hijacking your post for this. I wasn't sure if it warranted it's own post.

We all know we're being lied to about the corona virus case numbers. It's more a lie of omission than a statement of untruth, but we know it's a lie. I'd like to get everyone on the same page though. Let's do some math using the official numbers from the arkansas government.

We will be using [The thv timeline](https://www.thv11.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/timeline-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-in-arkansas/91-3af83b07-4df9-493b-94d6-e48c53a82cbf) and [this exponential growth calculator](https://miniwebtool.com/exponential-growth-calculator/) because I can't do math in my head. 

First a baseline. The first confirmed case was March 11th, and three weeks later on April 1st we had 624 cases. Go ahead and plug in:

Initial amount (Po) = 1 

Time (t) =3 (We're using weeks here)

Final Amount (P(t)) = 624

You should get ""Growth rate (r) = 2.14538345612"" Now, you can go back and put 2.145 under Growth rate and delete the final amount field. Calculate again. Still got about 623 point something as the result? Ok. Now increase the Time field to 3.5, or three and a half weeks, this weekend. [You end up with 1824.](https://miniwebtool.com/exponential-growth-calculator/?n1=1&amp;n2=2.14538345&amp;n3=3.5&amp;n4=) This weekend there should be 1824 infected. [Around seven weeks](https://miniwebtool.com/exponential-growth-calculator/?n1=1&amp;n2=2.14538345&amp;n3=7&amp;n4=) the entire population of Arkansas should be infected, which is the end of April. 

This is using Arkansas's own provided numbers, while we are under the effect of social distancing. To be fair there are factors at play you can't account for. For one, we're not discovering cases as people are infected, we're discovering them as we gain the ability to test, so we're probably discovering them faster than it is spreading. On the other hand, the virus probably had a head start which throws off the rate in the other direction. In either case 2.14 is close enough to the stated [R-0 of Covid19,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097725) which is between 1.5 - 3 depending on who you ask. It *sounds* right. This pace is what it *should be going forward.* 

If we see fifty more total infected instead of hundreds, then I gently suggest to the public they consider Hutchinson is being dishonest. Probably to cover his ass.

Why am I doing this? Because more and more models are coming out using numbers that don't make sense to me. Covidactnow.org has pushed back the date that we should be overwhelmed over a month, and I'm not sure I follow why. The official federal death rate expectation for the whole country uses a 80% infection rate, but only a 0.8% fatality rate, which would make americans basically Wolverine. Nobody seems to know what the hell is going on or what happens next.

We've also got less beds, staff, and vents per person, and BRMC Emergency services covers both Marion and Baxter County with **5** ambulances with the trucks to go to 8 if we can find enough staff.

In all honesty, rural communities are going to be much harder hit with this, as we have older populations with less money, lower levels of insurance, farther travel times in an ambulance.

First. That the primary purpose of Shelter in Place is to prevent Hospitals from overextending and reaching max capacity until the virus plateaus and the infection becomes manageable. This is the absolute truth. This is the main reason for Shelter in Place/Stay at Home orders. 

I then said I didn‚Äôt think it was needed in Arkansas since our hospitals have no indication of nearing capacity. 

Second. That the government has no legal right to to confine citizens to their homes unless Martial Law or a Full Quarantine are declared. Barring an invasion by a foreign power or a new ruling from SCOTUS, this is unequivocally true.

Pike County is one of the most rural in the state, but has tested 95 people, with only one positive.

Clark County has double the population, but has only tested only 58 people.  27 of them (47%) were positive.  Why can't we get more tests in the places that actually need them?

Those are in no way outliers either, take a look at Clay, Greene, Randolph, Baxter, Boone, Carroll, Ashley, Drew and dozens of others.  They all have pretty good testing, but only confirm the virus hasn't made it to those outlying areas.  Then you look at the places it HAS hit, and the tests are depressingly low.  

Pulaski, Washington, and Benton counties combine to be about a third of this state's populaion.  Yet they only count for less than 15% of the tests so far.  And if anything has been proven this far, it's that this virus thrives in more populated areas.

11686,theantivirus,"&gt;Evidence is not only from the total number of tests, but the rate of infection (new cases/day), hospitalizations, and deaths.

The way you say that would make an uninformed person believe that this is more information than just ""total number of tests"", but it isn't. Rate of infection is a subset of ""total number of tests"". New cases per day? ""Total number of deaths"". Hospitalizations and deaths? Exactly the same. All of this information is just based on a group of people that represents less than 0.3% of the high risk population. They haven't bothered testing many low risk or asymptomatic individuals, which is exactly why it doesn't give us an accurate picture.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You are right that Asa is not a doctor but at all the press conferences there are doctors and their advice and observations do not differ from Asa's. 

Of course doctors that are invited to speak at Asa's press conferences publicly agree with him. Why would you invite someone to speak who was going to contradict you? The global experts from the CDC and WHO disagree with him. Are we supposed to listen to Dr. Nate Smith, or the CDC and WHO? My money is on the country's agency and the global health organization over one doctor that happens to agree with a highly controversial opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Guidance from the CDC says to wear a mask in public. 

No, that is not what CDC guidance says. The CDC says this:

&gt; CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings **in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain**  ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html))

I made about 100 masks that I gave to a hospital in my hometown, and I do have one ready if I happen to be in a situation where I can't maintain appropriate distance. That has not been the case yet. I have only been out of my home to go to work and shop for essentials, and have not been within 6 feet of any person within the last 3 weeks besides a couple medical workers at a Red Cross blood drive. I have a mask if I need it, but I am still following CDC guidelines 100% on the issue. The governor is not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; a statewide lockdown is unlikely to bring much change from what we have in affect now 

This doesn't sound like a reason not to be one of the only states to disregard professional recommendations of the CDC and WHO. This sounds like a good reason to follow their recommendations. If not much changes, what exactly is the harm in being safe? You would be concerned if current restrictions ease? I am concerned that current restrictions are not enough. 

The governor made it illegal for cities and counties to protect themselves ([source](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2020/04/03/why-wont-the-mayors-do-more-on-sheltering-governor-wont-let-them)). What exactly is the reason for doing this? This should be a warning sign that something isn't right with the way he is running things. Why would you go out of your way to be one of the few who ignores professional recommendations, and then force local governments to ignore professional recommendations as well?",1586174350,fmkzl8r

MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. (AP) ‚Äî Authorities are investigating after a 14-year-old girl accidentally shot and killed her friend while playing a game of hide-and-seek, the Baxter County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Monday.

The shooting happened Friday at a home near Lake Norfork in northern Arkansas, the sheriff‚Äôs office said. According to a news release, the two 14-year-old girls were playing hide-and-seek when one of the girls found her father‚Äôs rifle and started playing with it, believing it to be unloaded.

The gun discharged and struck the other girl, killing her, the sheriff‚Äôs office said. The girl who died was from Jonesboro, but no names were released.

The sheriff‚Äôs office said an investigation was underway but foul play is not suspected.
