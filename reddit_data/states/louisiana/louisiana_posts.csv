29,cocoleen,1578344192,el06if,Nan,"Hello,

Long story short, my husband is from Louisiana and left in April 2016 to be based out of Pearl Harbor, HI with the US Navy. Because of his orders, he had to change his insurance from Geico to USAA. We sent in the proof of insurance showing the swap (no grab in time between Geico and USAA) with the vehicle's VIN, a copy of his HI Driver's License, and a copy of his orders from the US Navy - all of which they had asked for - but it's been 9 months and we still did not receive his refund. (We emailed and faxed all documents they requested)

Their reason for witholding his state taxes is because they claim we did not have insurance coverage for his vehicle April 2016 and on.

Does the process normally take long for Louisiana? He had called the office a few times and they told us to check online. We didn't see a portal you could check the status of your disputes and the email they told us to send everything to has never replied to us.

Will they do the same to us for 2019 tax filings? (This happened last year when we filed for 2018) With the Navy, my husband's home of record is Louisiana so he pays Louisiana taxes. If this will be an issue for 2020, we will change his home of record to Hawaii.

Any information would be greatly appreciated. I am from Hawaii so I have no familiarity with how the OMV in Louisiana works and all the numbers they provided for us to talk to someone ended up with someone telling us they can't give any information.

Thank you!",Louisiana,OMV Collections (Need help)

I graduate. I'm looking for a job. I find one. On my third interview I walk into the firm. They tell me they're gonna train me up for a few months and then have me dispatched to different places overseas. They'll pay for my flights and my hotel. I said that sounds great. I'd like to see the world. I thought I knew what to expect. They tell me OK, you're going to London. Yeah, that's basically just down the road, less than a few hours on the flight, Scotland to England. Cool. I'd been before a few times. Next up, Norway. Again, it's what I expected. Scotland and Norway are right next to each other. Look at your globe, they're basically whispering in our ear. Nice place. Nice people. Expensive beer. I come back. A month passes. Alright we're sending you to America. I say cool. I went to Orlando, Florida with family when I was like 13 and had a good time. The food was good. The people were friendly. I'd finally visited a place I'd seen in movies and television shows my whole life. It felt surreal. Now they didn't tell me where I was going. They just said America, to which I thought well, that could be 1 of 50 places. The last time I checked, that's how many states you people have.

I get a phone call from my boss. He tells me he's sending me an email. It contains the info. I'm like alright. He hangs up, saying goodbye first because this isn't the movies were people end the call without being courteous and wishing you a farewell. I pull out my laptop. Open the email. Now, I was expecting like, New York, maybe even Chicago, that's where my colleagues had been sent before. It seemed the most likely. With travel from Scotland to the US, the most common places the flights go are New York City and Chicago. I read the email and then I knew that I was about to have to do some research. People can say Americans are ignorant but, I won't, because I had no idea about where the fuck Baton Rouge once. I had only heard of one city in Louisiana and I'm sure you can guess where 


August 2016 - Baton Rouge

So I go from Glasgow to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Atlanta and then Atlanta to Baton Rouge. I leave the airport, walk outside and grab a taxi. I tell the driver the hotel I'm staying at. He nods and takes me there. I decided to make conversation with the guy, the journey was going to take a while. I ask him his name, he tells me his friends call him Scooter. I did not feel like me and this man knew each other well enough that I would consider him my friend but alright, Scooter it is. He told me that morning he and his wife agreed to a divorce and that evening, he was going to meet an old High School girlfriend he had reconnected with on Facebook a few weeks previously. I just kinda nodded and was like, OK. He tells me in graphic detail what he's going to do to this woman, despite not possessing ""that same 17 year old stamina"" that he once had. I just kept letting out a laugh every minute or so and going ""Yeah, I hear you man"" 


So the guy drops me off. I check in at the hotel. I'm tired from the flight. I have an early night. Wake up the next day. Go to meet the client, blah blah blah. That night I decide to go for a drink at a local bar. I can still remember the name of the place but I had to check Google Earth to be sure. I'm 95% sure it was a place called Bogie's. Anyway. I head in. Head to the bar, order some whiskys and watch the television when a guy that is clearly under the heavy influence of cocaine approaches me. He proceeds to talk about the two teams playing on the TV. I know fucking nothing about the NFL so I just nod and agree. He then offers to buy me a drink. I tell him thanks but I just bought two so I'll buy him a drink. He thanks me, orders some weird fucking cocktail that I can't remember the name of (didn't expect the man to order a cocktail but fuck it) He tells me his name is Bobby. I tell him mine. He then detects I have an unfamiliar accent and asks where I'm from. I tell him Glasgow, Scotland. At that point he shakes my hand and tells me that he's gonna call me Scotty 2 Hotty, after the WWE wrestler from the 90's. That's where his brain went. I've never watched Star Trek but I've heard there's a Scottish guy called Scottie so, maybe that's something. 

He challenges me to finish my drink before he finishes his and I'm still a competitive man-child at heart so I accept and win (I'm Scottish, I've been drinking booze from a very young age, I'm used to it) and I seemed to gain some respect from Bobby from winning, so much so he offers me some coke. Now, I've done coke. It's popular where I'm from. At one time, we were the highest consumers of it on earth, a few years ago we were anyway. But I'm hesitant. I don't know this man. I don't know what his shit has in it. I politely decline. He nods, pours some onto the bar counter and starts snorting. The bartender doesn't like that. He comes over and starts arguing. I'm realising this might descend into a tricky situation. I fake a phone call and head outside. 

Bobby joins me a minute later and asks if I want to head to the nearest strip club. I think fuck it, I'm here myself, no friends or whatever, ok. So we head to this place which again, I'm going back to Google Maps and I'm sure it was Crazy Horse Cabaret. We go there, Bobby is friendly with the bouncer. We head inside. Immediately this blonde haired woman walks up and asks if I want a dance. Again, fuck it, I was a few drinks deep and drunk and I say sure. The girl turns to Bobby and asks him if she can give me a dance. He shrugs and tells her yeah, then she kisses him on the lips and leads me to the back. By this point, I'm thrown off. That little interaction tipped me off that these two are in a relationship and that maybe he's brought me here for a reason. He wants me to have a threesome with him and his woman. He wants me to have sex with her while he watches. They're gonna invite me back to their place and rob me. So I tell her I need to take an urgent shit and I slip out the back and go to find a taxi. Bobby comes running out, telling me to come back inside. I tell him I gotta go but he is persistent, revealing that if I tip his girlfriend $100 I can ""suck on her titties"" That was all I needed to hear at that point and I quickly got into the taxi and headed back to the hotel. 

The next morning, I headed back to the airport and flew home. But you know what? I had a funny story to tell and the place seemed pretty cool. So yeah, thank you people for your Southern Hospitality.",Louisiana,In 2015 I visited your state and I have a (probably too long) story to tell

This might be a bit of a stretch, but I have lost some things of extreme importance and I need to exhaust all my avenues in order to find them. I will start with the basics.  

I have lost some tapes. Audio-cassettes and micro-cassettes to be exact. There are other items that were with them, but they are not nearly as important and sentimental. For a bit of context, the past few years have been very difficult for me and I have moved multiple times from several terrible living situations. However, one constant has been these old tapes from my childhood.

A few years ago, I began my efforts to digitize them, and succeeded into converting 13 tapes into digital format, but I was far more concerned with the tapes being damaged beyond repair in the building where I was living. As such, I gave them to a family member to store them in a safe, climate-controlled storage unit they were using for other family heirlooms and furniture.

I thought that they were safe in storage until very recently, when the family member storing them moved and the storage unit was cleaned out completely. I was not present for this, but I was able to go through all the things that were removed after the fact. Having gone through many, many boxes and Tupperware, I was unable to find them. It is plausible that I simply have not found the right box, or that they were moved to a closet out of sight. But I was quite thorough and now I am at a loss as to where they could be. I am devastated to think that they might be lost forever, especially when I was so certain that they would be safe.  

\*\*\*It is possible, but not likely that they were donated to the Goodwill in Alexandria, Louisiana.\*\*\* I sincerely hope that is not the case, but it is a possibility. Alexandria, Louisiana is where they would have gone missing or been found, unless they were transported elsewhere, though I fail to see why. I no longer live in this area and never plan to do so again, so their retrieval, if possible will be a matter of shrewd negotiation and potential compensation if I am able to afford it. If nothing else, if any of these items are found, I will gladly pay shipping.

Onto the items in question.

The tapes and other ephemera were in a box. This box, if these items were not removed, would have been a white box. It was a re-used box of some kind (I believe it had green lettering, perhaps used for citrus or food. It was not very deep and not very long. Perhaps 7 inches deep and 15 inches long. It would have been labeled ‘Old Tapes’. Within the box, as far as I can remember, would have been 20-30 audio-cassette tapes, 5-7 micro-cassette tapes, a slim version of the original Playstation, a small clamshell of PS1 games, a bright yellow Walkman, and potentially some cables that I used for audio transfer/digitization of the tapes. Possibly some notebooks and journals. It is very likely that there were other sentimental items placed in the box at the last minute that I simply cannot recall.

	As far as the tapes are concerned, they are mostly conversational vignettes between my childhood friends, as well as several improvised skits, terrible singing and general silliness. There were many mix tapes of bad 90s music and a few miscellaneous music cassettes that I picked up from garage sales. I won’t go into extreme detail about the content of the tapes, since this would bloat the post far too much. However, I will include descriptions of some of the most prominent tapes and what was written on their labels. I will also include some first names of those involved that would be easily recognized on the tapes.

First names: Dena, Elizabeth, Emily, Jacob, Danny, Patrick, Andrew, Devon, Drew, Matt, Phrasier.

Names on Tapes: Soul Reaver, Disturbing…, Who Knows?, Are you stupid, or is it just me?, Triple SSS, Interviews, Top 10, Shoes On The Roof, Old Memorex Tape, Feet Twins, Diss Recordings, The Killer Coaster, Uno Tournament, Live And Learn, Stroke 9. These are only the ones I can recall off the top of my head, as well as some that I have transcripts of. There are many, many more, varying in content.  

Most of the tapes were Maxell brand, some Memorex, some Phillips, some TDK, some Sony. Some were commercial audio-cassette versions of records or musicals. I DO NOT HAVE PICTURES. I saw no reason to take any whilst in the middle of the tedious digitization process.

As ridiculous and embarrassing as they are, they are an integral part of my childhood and honestly a bit of an obsession. The thought of them in someone’s moldy basement or in a landfill somewhere fills me with an anxiety I can scarcely begin to describe. I am currently making efforts to contact family members and friends who might have existing copies. I likely should have acted sooner, but I thought that perhaps they would have been found by now. Either way, I can’t just do nothing and I hope that it’s not too late to send out the message and hope it finds the right people.

In the rare case that you are in possession of any of my tapes, or have any leads in regards to the tapes or box, I can provide further contact details and further information. I am not familiar with Reddit, so please forgive me if I am stilted or uncertain of decorum. I will do my best to provide necessary information within reason.",Louisiana,"Lost Childhood Tapes - Alexandria, LA"

&gt; Long believed that the underlying cause of the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression), (which he called ""Mr. Roosevelt's depression"") was the growing disparity between the rich and everyone else.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1) For most of his political career, he was endeared to the ""little man,"" which refers to the [rural poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_poverty).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-4) The Share Our Wealth program was going to become the capstone project for Long's populist agenda 

The key planks of the Share Our Wealth platform included:

1. No person would be allowed to accumulate a personal [net worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth) of more than 300 times the average family fortune. A graduated capital levy tax would be assessed on all persons with a net worth exceeding $1 million.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
2. Annual incomes would be limited to $1 million and inheritances would be capped at $5.1 million.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
3. Every family was to be furnished with a homestead allowance of not less than one-third the average family wealth of the country. Every family was to be guaranteed an annual family income of at least $2,000 to $2,500, or not less than one-third of the average annual family income in the United States. Yearly income, however, cannot exceed more than 300 times the size of the average family income.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
4. An old-age [pension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension) would be made available for all persons over 60.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
5. To balance agricultural production, the government would preserve/store surplus goods, abolishing the practice of destroying surplus food and other necessities due to lack of purchasing power.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
6. Veterans would be paid what they were owed (a pension and healthcare benefits).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
7. Free education and training for all students to have equal opportunities in all schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions for training in the professions and vocations of life.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)
8. The raising of revenue and taxes for the support of this program was to come from the reduction of swollen fortunes from the top, as well as for the support of public works to give employment whenever there may be any slackening necessary in private enterprise.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth#cite_note-Long's_Programs-1)",Louisiana,Huey P.

I have contacted the Louisiana State Board of Examiners of Psychologists and they responded with snippets of law (§303. Doctoral Programs in Psychology), but there are still some things that are unclear to us. 

We understand that it is essential to get certified Spanish-to-English translations of her pertinent documents, but what do we do after that? Some people have suggested getting her degrees and certifications credentialed through a credential evaluation service, but is this necessary if the LSBEP is reviewing certified translated copies of her documents anyway?

21 year old male here

I’m Irish, I have a friend in Louisiana he offered for me to move to the US and post up with him for a visit or if I wanted to stay with him until I got a place in the US.

What do you think?

Currently in Ireland it’s in a housing crisis rooms around going in people’s toilets, sheds for €600 a month in Dublin, my father is an educated psychologist living in a dingy apartment 2 bed apartment for €1,000 a month.

We have free healthcare but you need to earn less than €250 a week for complete cover, I don’t qualify and even though I pay out of pocket I have to wait for months because the system is in bloat.

It’s also hard to study here I had to drop out of college because the bus fees where criminal and theirs not many courses around my immediate area.

While President Donald Trump's administration was working to relax offshore drilling regulations, there was a spike in offshore accidents and a decrease in safety inspections, according an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement — the federal agency tasked with regulating offshore drilling — has not yet released a tally of offshore incident statistics for 2019. But the Center for American Progress dug through the agency's budget documents to find the number of injuries per hour worked on oil and gas facilities on the federal Outer Continental Shelf.

American Progress found that the number of injuries increased 21% in 2018 and 2019 compared with the previous two-year period of 2016 and 2017. The data includes injuries that require medical treatment beyond first aid. It excludes those stemming from natural causes, illness or that are self-inflicted, according to the budget documents.

""At worst, this is an unraveling of safety gains made after Deepwater Horizon,"" the catastrophic BP spill of 2010, said Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at American Progress.

Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that BSEE Director Scott Angelle — a former Louisiana state official and 2015 gubernatorial candidate — asked his staff to make changes to the Well Control Rule that would cut down on the cost of compliance for industry, despite advise from BSEE engineers that the changes were unsafe. The changes included eliminating some best practices put into place after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded.

The rate of offshore injuries was trending downward between 2015 and 2017. But there was a sharp uptick in accidents in 2018. The injury rate is calculated based on the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked, which includes operator and contractor hours worked for production, construction and drilling operations on the Outer Continental Shelf, an area that includes the Gulf of Mexico.

While there were fewer accidents in 2019 than in 2018, there's reason to believe that the incidents in 2019 were more serious. In February, the BSEE reported that there was one fatality in 2018. While the agency has not released the number of fatalities in 2019, local media reports indicate there were at least nine offshore oil worker deaths, according to an analysis by The Times-Picayune. That would mean at least 8% of the injuries reported in 2019 were fatalities.

Last March, a helicopter destined for an offshore platform crashed near Galliano. A pilot and a Houma-area oilfield worker were on board. Neither survived.

In April, an Abbeville man fell off a platform in the Gulf of Mexico. A 24-hour search ensued, but he was never found.

In May and June, four people died after falling from three different offshore platform decks. The BSEE sent out a safety alert in early June after the first two deaths.

In December, Panther Helicopters Inc., based in Belle Chasse, reported that one of its helicopters did not reach its destination to an offshore platform. A search for the two people on board was eventually suspended.

The number of offshore worker fatalities in 2019 is more than the previous five years combined. From 2014 to 2017, the BSEE reported one fatality in each fiscal year.

""If this pattern of tragedies and accidents isn't a wake-up call to Director Angelle and the Interior Department, I don't know what is,"" Lee-Ashley said. ""By weakening safety rules and cutting back on enforcement, the Trump administration is gambling with peoples' lives and with the health of the Gulf Coast. It's reckless, wrong and there needs to be an immediate reckoning.""

In 2017, Trump issued an executive order directing the BSEE to reexamine the so-called Well Control Rule, which was imposed in the wake of the 2010 spill — the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history — to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence.

The order directed the bureau to find ways to encourage energy exploration and production on the Outer Continental Shelf — an area that extends more than 200 miles offshore. The order also called for reducing unnecessary regulation while ensuring that any energy exploration is safe and environmentally responsible.

Among the changes to the Well Control Rule were the removal of certain requirements for real-time monitoring of offshore operations by onshore engineers; an extension of the date by which blowout preventers must comply with certain requirements; and an avenue for companies to more easily obtain waivers from meeting the minimum ""safe drilling margin,"" a measure designed to reduce the risk of sudden changes in well pressure that could cause a blowout. The changes went into effect in September of 2018 and May 2019.

In addition to a recent increase in offshore injuries, American Progress found a decrease in inspections of offshore facilities and enforcement actions against offshore oil and gas operators. BSEE conducted nearly 2,000 fewer inspections between 2017 and 2019 than the previous three-year period, according to agency data, a decline of 13%. Over the same time period, enforcement actions against offshore oil and gas operators dropped by 38%.

The BSEE responded to the American Progress findings by saying that while the number of inspection visits has decreased, the number of inspections per visit has increased. ""BSEE views an increase in total inspections conducted coupled with a decrease in enforcement actions within a specified time frame, which is what occurred in 2017 and 2018, as an increase in compliance,"" said BSEE spokeswoman Karla Marshall.

The BSEE expects to release the incident statistics for 2019 by the end of March, Marshall said. The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association declined to answer questions for this story, instead issuing a prepared statement.

“The safety of our operations, our workers and our community is a top priority for Louisiana’s oil and natural gas industry, and thanks to new initiatives and technologies our offshore energy industry has never been safer or stronger,"" said LMOGA President Tyler Gray. ""Industry standards, modern technology, innovation and experience working under the oversight of state and federal officials have made offshore development safer than it has ever been – and continuously becoming safer because technologies are ever-improving.”

I might be combining my trip with a visit to Texas (Houston and Dallas are looking fairly likely) but nothing has been finalized yet. 

I'm European (Dutch), visiting the US for the first time and will visit with my girlfriend. General travel tips to the US are welcome but I'm fairly certain we'll figure out those particulars in the next few months.

I'm aiming to visit New Orleans around Mardi Gras and ideally would stay up to a week in the city. What are your favorite places to visit? Restaurants to get some good food (especially looking forward to taste the local cuisine!)? Cultural highlights?

I would like to visit the bayous as I think they're fascinating! Any tips regarding tours or places to visit? And besides the bayous, what are some other great places to experience the local flora and fauna?

I would love to visit a NFL game (am not a super avid fan but I absolutely love the atmosphere, tactics and athletics involved!), but I think it's post-season if we visit around Mardi Gras? If that's indeed the case, is college football still on? Or a friendly or exhibition game? And how easy is it to visit a game?

And of course, besides NO, what other places would you say really capture Louisiana?

I've recently been interested in reading about former Louisiana politician Huey Long. Historically, he appears to have been kind of an interesting oddity, where he was extremely successful while pushing populist rhetoric, as a ""democrat"" in the south. His political affiliation seems somewhat irrelevant to me, since his political views were radically different than any Democrat or republican, then and today. Anyway, I have been wondering if present day Louisiana folk are familiar with him, if he is mentioned in Louisiana schools, if any of his legacy has persisted since his untimely death, and if any of his rhetoric, for the people who know of him , influences you today. 

TLDR; does former Louisiana politician Huey Long hold any relevancy in modern political views in Louisiana folk? 

Note: I am not here to argue politics, push a view point, encourage political discourse, etc. I am purely wondering if his legacy persists in Louisiana today.

A comment emphasized that while the federal deadline was pushed back to July, states' differences may throw a wrench into people's fillings. As such, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/flvzg5/_/fl0uuhl) have a wonderfully helpful list of states' announcements about their deadlines, which included Louisiana. Ours is in May, far before the new federal July deadline, so be wary that your state taxes are (as of today) due *far before* July!

I may very well have misinterpreted the whole situation and/or over-explained something rather simple/well-known, but that has almost become my specialty, so I wouldn't be surprised.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [275,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&amp;feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). Update: [Speed trumps perfection](https://twitter.com/ConallMcD/status/1238865202868883461).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w). March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)). March 20th update: Latest genome analysis seems to suggest two viruses may have combined ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-origins-genome-analysis-covid19-data-science-bats-pangolins/))

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, or the one over in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), both of which will be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

I just saw a ""facebook live"" video of some individuals in New Orleans on the fucking street congregating like there is no pandemic going on.

ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? There is absolutely NO \*NO\* REASON to be out and about like that. I don't give a fuck what the reasoning was. I DON'T CARE. STAY IN YOUR FUCKING HOUSES. When all of you dumb asses start developing symptoms and start saying things like ""oh well, it is what it is"" or ""Oh no, i need help, except there's no more ventilators"" or even THE FUCKING AUDACITY ""the government needs to supply us with more"" and are PRAYING/BEGGING to be seen by a doctor, it'll be too fucking late.

You don't care about anybody but your fucking selves? FINE. But DO care about someone's mother, father, sister, brother, husband, or wife that is working the front lines as doctors and nurses trying to save people and then they see this kind of bullshit and think ""wow, I'm risking my health and maybe my family's health while these inconsiderate PIECES OF SHIT are not taking the lockdown seriously."". 

WHY? My mom is a nurse, cancer survivor, and hell of a fucking woman. She's in the hospital EVERY night. She has to re-use her personal protective equipment EVERY shift. She's working like MANY of our family members out there, while people like this are not taking this seriously. My mother - who is NEVER scared of her job - told me she was scared to go to work tonight. I told her I had faith in her, that she will be alright. 

You all want to drown yourselves and ""live your best lives"" or ""let them do what they want to do"". It doesn't WORK that way with this because when THEY get sick, goes who has to fucking take care of them?.... YOUR ACTIONS - AFFECT EVERYONE ELSE.

Martial law should happen during this time. People should be arrested for congregating like that while there is a pandemic. A virus - A virus with NO vaccine, no treatment, and is wiping out dozens of people everyday. 

Fuck off, I don't want to hear about freedoms being taken away, about guns, liberals, conservatives, republicans, or god damn democrats. I want YOU TO STAY IN YOUR GOD DAMN HOUSES and HEED the warnings of the CDC. If not, you should be arrested... Living your best life in a fucking jail cell.

Are you mad? GOOD. Maybe you'll use the fucking brain of yours and think for one second about someone else besides yourself.

To all the HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: Thank you for all that you are doing now and know that some of us respect you enough to stay put until instructed otherwise.",Louisiana,I Didn't Believe in Martial Law... Until Just Now.

I have some savings, but I will be broke in a month. I know file for unemployment, I did. But here in Louisiana we have the dumbest requirements, compared to basically every other state I looked up.

“To have a monetarily eligible claim, the monetary determination must show that you have been paid wages by an employer who paid unemployment insurance taxes during the base period of your claim (also called covered employment.) The wages you earned during your base period must be at least $1,200 and total at least 1.5 times your wages in the base period quarter when you earned the most money (also called the high quarter.) For example, if you earned $3,000 in your high quarter, then your total wages in covered employment for the base period must be at least $4,500.”


I worked as a waiter during the summer and made a lot of money to get through the semester. So the money I made in that quarter is SUPER high compared to the rest, so I’m not eligible for ANY benefits. I would’ve been BETTER working LESS and paying LESS TAXES.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

If you think you cannot live without buying these items for a little while, I assure you that you actually can. 

Whoever is going to Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops literally “for something to do” or “to get the kids out the house” or anything similar to that — STAY HOME.

The stores HAVE offered employees the option to take a “leave of absence” and stay home during this pandemic, BUT the hourly employees  who do not work only get paid based on 1 of 3 conditions. 

1 — use whatever vacation time they have until it runs out or things return to normal. 


2 — catch the virus, and be paid for 2 weeks. 


3 — the particular location completely closes (not even curbside service, which they have NOT moved to yet). At that point, pay will be for 2 weeks. That pay may or may not be their full regular paychecks. After that, the company will see how things are looking. 


Below is the information about “supporting their outfitters” (employees) from their public statement on COVID-19.

“Supporting our Outfitters
Our incredible team of Outfitters are more than just employees - they are our extended family. To support them during this difficult time, we're waiving our standard attendance policy and giving everyone the option to stay home. We're also extending additional paid time off and benefits to team members who become sick and require testing or quarantine. Should it become necessary to close a store, Outfitters will continue to be paid for a period of time.”

That's the worst of it in my opinion. Everything that is going on right now and you leave some of the most susceptible people to the virus to fend for themselves. I work a plant job and I'm damn sure glad when I had the choice I turned Frymaster down. I just had to share this because I just can't believe a company I had respect for is this heartless.

717,Judge_Dr_Sunshine,1586057575,fv75ic,Nan,"I'm conducting a poll to see what Reddit users' main concern is about the current health and economic crisis . If you could vote and then provide an explanation of why you picked what, it would be much appreciated. For instance, if you are elderly or have a health condition, please explain the data you have found about why you are afraid of contracting the disease, or explain your circumstances about being afraid of a loved one potentially contracting the disease. If you are afraid of the government taking your rights, please explain what rights they are and factual data related to where and how you have seen that happen (ie. gun rights or the first amendment right to assemble). If you are afraid of economic collapse, please describe either the personal implications you are undergoing by losing a job, a small business, or loosing equity in the stock market, or if you'd like, current economic trends based on factual data. This poll is limited to residents of Louisiana. If you are outside of the state please refrain from participating.

Ideally all three are the most important, so if you have ideas of what could be done to keep the incidence of Coronavirus down while keeping the other two within reason, please feel free to discuss. And, please be respectful of other people's opinions.

There is a balancing act the government is currently taking in between human life, which is extremely important to all of us, and the rights the we have provided to us by the U.S. Constitution alongside the economic implications. I encourage people to continue practicing safety measures, such as washing your hands, avoid touching your face, maintain a six foot distance from others, remain indoors whenever possible, and clean and disinfect surfaces. The number of infected is skyrocketing in the city I live in and I'm pretty sure people all across the United States *will* run the risk of either dying or having a loved one die. Please be conscious of your actions.
