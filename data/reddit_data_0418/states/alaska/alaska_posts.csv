BS in Bioengineering (2013-2019) and a year and a half of professional experience at a J&amp;J orthopaedic division (rapid prototyping and custom implants). Time for me to grow the fuck up, and get the hell away from my parents because our relationship is not as healthy as it should be. Being financially tied to them is just...not okay anymore. So I think it's time for me to leave and figure out my own life...independently from my parents for a few years.   

Been to Alaska already, grandparents drive up there in their RV nearly every other year and they're already planning another trip for this year. I want to tag along with them and/or meet them in Alaska again.

I haven’t seen snow in my life, but something in my soul yearns to live in the Alkaskan wilderness and find my spirit animal under the undulating colors of the Aoroa Borialis. 

After I’ve built my log cabin with elbow grease and and my great uncle’s Swiss im going to strangle mooses with my bare hands. 

I’m going to erect a thrown of moose bones outside my cabin so wolves and shit will be like: “nahh man I ain’t gin’ fuk with dat”. 

Imma catch salmon with my teeth by learning from the bears. I’m actually going to sneak off with a cub and raise it as my trust steed. We’re going to be bff’s and hunt together and shit. At night I’ll sleep on its tummy because I’ve always imagined bear stomachs to be the animal equivalent of memory foam mattresses.

Anyways it can’t be too far from civilization because I need satellite television, cell phone signal (just got the iPhone 11 Pro Max in Periwinkle (or is it lavender I can’t really tell)), and this face cream from Sephora I CAN’T live without!!

Which route should we take? I've heard about the Klondike highway, is this the best way? I've also heard about the Alcan highway, will we have to take both? Are there ample food and gas stops along the way or should be plan to bring food and fuel? Is my car going to have any trouble completing the journey?

We'd love to make the most out of the road trip on the way up. Is it possible to camp the whole way? We'd really like to see some parks and nature, and save some money on lodging at the same time, even if this means taking a more scenic route. 

What is it like crossing between the boarders? We both have passports but will we need any documentation for our dog?

Hello, 22 yr old female here. I am from the country in nh and two years ago I moved to Chicago, it overall has been a good experience but I miss nature and have been wanting to get back into things I grew up doing like hiking, hunting, and fishing. I don’t have a college degree and have been able to support myself off menial jobs fine for the most part. I love the cold, and I already have experience moving somewhere new without knowing anyone or having an strong plan.
I feel like I’m in a bit of a rut here in Chicago and I think it’s time I move on to somewhere new. I’m not great at making new friends bc I’m pretty introverted but it was easy to do so in Chicago bc ppl are quite friendly. Does the same go for Anchorage? I am liberal but not super outspoken, I tend to make friends with fellow queer ppl. How does that fly out there? I’m asexual, I don’t know many others in Chicago so I’d imagine it’s also not super common up there. 
Im hoping to work a more laborious job, and go hiking and fishing with some new friends similar to me. 
It will financially set me back quite a bit bc I’m also going to buy a car if I move. That part doesn’t stress me out too much tho. 
Also not gonna lie, I did grow up in the country, but the bears up there make me nervous because I would probably do a lot of hiking alone. Any tips from solo hikers? I really do enjoy solitude and am not crazy about the idea of meetup groups, but I would love to make a close friend or two to do some activities with.
I’m not really interested in any other place in the country except anchorage. 
Anyways, I guess I’m not sure what I’m asking, I’m mostly looking for words of encouragement and advice. Thanks.",alaska,Should I move to Alaska?

THE CODE by Morris Stuttard

You aren’t sure if it’s the cold or anticipation to blame, but you drum the floor of the car with the heels of your boots, your knees bouncing like pistons. You turn off your phone and look up.

“Come on, Dad.”

Unable to lean forward, you fall forty-five degrees sideways into the empty passenger seat to see the sky. Community jail car parks aren’t the most lively of places even on the brightest of days, and today is not one of them—the breakup season sky is bloated with cloud and the upper half of Mount Verstovia has been seared off by a ceiling of grey.

“Bit of sunshine too much to ask? Just this once?”

Returning upright, a chill down your neck sets you shivering and, as you always do at the first sign of discomfort, throw a concerned look down at the giant swelling beneath your jacket. Right on cue, you feel a kick of complaint from the eight-month boy inside your nineteen year old belly and immediately turn the car key, while speaking to soothe him.

“Once upon a time there was a place called Alaska. It was cold. Get used to it, buddy.”

The heating whirs into action. Hot air streams out, which is significantly less pleasant to breathe than the cold before. A moment of frustration, then you open the window a little as well.

“Perfect balance. See? Mom’s got this.”

“There she is!” comes a voice so close it makes you jump. From just the other side of the window appears a grinning face, which would look boyish if it weren’t for the grey stubble on its chin.

“Dad!” you throw open the car door and go to jump out but remember you are still strapped in. You unclip the seatbelt and heave yourself out like a scoop of too-frozen ice cream. You can’t stop thinking about ice cream.

When you finally stand, your father’s boyish glee has quite reversed into an adult sternness as he stares at the giant bulge.

“Surprise!” you hold out both arms and stick your tummy forward like a gift for the soon-to-be-grandfather. He is not altogether receiving it like a gift.

\*

“What do you mean you don’t know who the father is?” Tom winces then scowls, though never taking his eyes off Swan Lake out of the window, so in awe is he of open space as you drive. “Don’t answer that question.”

“Relax, Dad—it’s either Jack or Boris. I don’t think you know B-”

“Jack! Arnie’s kid? They’re Republicans, Tatty!”

“And Boris’s family are Democrats.”

“Great. So what does that make the little one?”

“An anarchist. That’s on me.” And you punctuate your resolve by pulling out from behind a truck with your foot right down hard to the floor.

Your father moans out a sigh, and you can’t help but throw him a look of sympathy. “I’m nineteen now, Dad. A lot has changed.”

You drive on in silence as the lakeside view turns to inner city. Everything you pass is a memory come back to life for your father, and you let him swim with his thoughts.

At last he turns back to you and looks again at the bulge.

“Eight months?”

“And a week, yeah.”

“I always wondered why you never left the visitors’ booth before me. You were hiding it.”

“That’s what you do with nice surprises.” You offer a smile to help him defuse his anger. It works, and he settles with a roll of the eyes, up from city to blanketed sky.

“So one *potential* father is a trapper’s son. The other…?”

“People are sometimes different to their parents, Dad.”

“Please answer the que--”

You roll past McDonalds.

The child in Tom returns in a flash and he flaps a hand, trying to master speech over a surge of excitement. At last, the word comes. “Stop!”

\*

After the second Big Mac, Tom finally looks up at you from his tray of burger wrappers and fries, issuing a quick response before biting into a newly unveiled third. “Lawyers? Both of them? And what do they think of this ‘arrangement’?”

“They are fine. It took them a while. It’s Jack’s Dad who disapproves.”

“Well, there’s a surprise,” manages Tom.

You study him over your obscenely topping-covered McFlurry, and ask this question with no less attention. “You don’t disapprove... do you, Dad?”

He holds off on another bite and looks back. “I was kind of hoping you’d go to college, Tatty…” You harden. He softens. “No. I don’t disapprove. Not if you’re happy.”

You sidle off the seat, stand, and go to your father, giving him a look down at his lap like a dog up to a couch.

He smiles in defeat and leans back so you can sit on his knees—a big hunched bowling ball. “You’re not so little anymore, honey.”

“Telling me.”

You lay your head against his shoulder.

“I missed you, Dad.”

“Missed you too, Sugar Puff,” and he manages to arc an arm round from behind you to get the third burger to his mouth.

\*

You pull into the driveway just as the sun finds a space beneath the clouds and beams its gold like leaf across the wide expanse of water beyond. Any other day, you might not notice, but today the sight feels new.

“How is the store doing?”

“Great. Jack built a veranda. We serve coffee now. Jack’s gonna make a sign.”

“Nice.”

A look at your father over the roof of the car fails to reveal whether he is pleased or not that others are helping run what was always your Mom’s little business. He just smiles at the sun and then joins you as you go to the door.

“It’s bigger than I remember. The house.” And he shepherds you up the steps as if pregnancy were a disability.

You resist the impulse to tell him the house is going to seem a lot bigger when you move out next month. Swollen from the thaw, the door needs a little shunt of your shoulder to open. You step inside. Tom breathes out a deep sigh of pleasure as he follows you in.

“Good to be--”

“--Surprise!” comes a chorus of shouts from faces as they pop up from behind couches, counters, out of doorways and even one cupboard. Fifteen streamers go pop and fill the air with mulit-coloured debris. Jules, Tom’s younger brother, ballets his way across the living room with a large scroll, which unravels into a WELCOME HOME, BRUH banner that his girlfriend Bex secures the other end of from the kitchen.

“Surprise-mania,” mutters Tom as you beam at everyone while closing the front door behind.

“They missed you, too.”

“Everyone’s here.”

“Everyone except the tax man!” laughs Jerry, Tom’s bear-shouldered older brother as he leads the converging of family and friends around Tom, embracing him, beard to cheek. An assault of back-clapping hugs and kisses. You stand back with an overflowing smile as Jack and Boris sidle over to you—Jack pecks the top of your head from his ominous height while Boris says hi to the bump, placing a gentle hand upon it.

“You told him, right?” whispers Jack, while keeping a quite unnatural grin of welcome on his face towards your father.

“Half of it,” you whisper back.

Tom is at last released from the crowd of welcomers and turns to face the two lads beside his daughter. You watch him as he absorbs this picture of unconventional love. There is a moment as you hold your breath for a reaction. It comes—his eyes glimmer and his mouth slips into a smile. He extends a hand.

“Jack.”  
“Mr Reynolds,” says Jack, as they both squeeze hard on the other’s hand for a reason you are sure neither would be able to explain if asked.

Tom turns to the gentler of the two. “And you must be Boris.”

“Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. Good to have you… out,” mumbles Boris, flushing.

“Not half as good as it is to be out, I can tell ya. So... lots been going on while I’ve been away, I see.”

Jack and Boris look down at their shoes. “Yeah,” they say in unison.

“A toast!” calls Jerry as he finishes pouring a glass of red and passes it to Tom, who throws a glance your way before taking it.

You do your best not to show any sign of disapproval or concern. “Don’t worry,” whispers Boris, reading your thoughts, and gives your hand a squeeze.

Jack and Boris seize the opportunity to escape the early-party awkwardness and reach for their glasses from the window sill. Bex passes you a glass of cranberry juice and you silent-mouth a ‘thank you’ back, while Jules hops down from a chair, having finished securing the welcome banner.

“Glass. Where’s my glass?”

Bex hands it to Jules and they entwine arms, hands and fingers. All face Jerry, who holds up his drink and baritones words through his beard like a viking with a horn of mead.

“It’s been two long years without you, brother. Please, please, please—do us all a favour and stay on the right side of the law...”

“Or just don’t get caught! That’s also fine,” pipes up Jules with a mischievous grin.

\*

You spy just two refills of your father’s glass over the course of the party and none of the shadow that hung over him when he would drink to hurt. It is thanks to Bex’s thoughtfulness that the gathering doesn’t go on longer than needed. She reminds Jules of his morning flight to LA and, albeit with a twinge of disappointment, he stands and joins her in saying his goodbyes. Within twenty minutes the rest are gone as well.

You remember to kiss Jack first this time, to keep things even, and the two go off their own ways, Boris walking back towards the city, Jack the other way. You listen for any sign of discontent in their farewells to each other.

“Night, Jack.”

“Night, Boris.”

There is none, and you close the door with a smile.

Only to see your father pouring another glass.

“Dad!”

“It’s fine, honey. I want to celebrate. I’m going to be a grandfather!”

You remove the glass from his hand with a frown and are glad to see that he lets you. There were times when it would have been easier to remove his arm. “There’s always a reason to have a drink, Dad. It’s finding a reason \*not to\* that counts.”  
“You still remember that stuff, huh?”

“Yes, Dad,” you say, showing just how much more you remember from his two failed attempts at rehab.

Tom sits on the couch and scratches the inside of one thumb with the index finger on the same hand. You go sit beside him—your weight falling into the couch because of something you were probably taught in Physics once. He puts his arm around you.

“We’ve got a lot to get ready, huh? With the little one on his way...” he says, looking down at the globe in your centre.

“Yes,” you say, realising there is never going to be a good time to tell him you are moving out.

“The lads seem nice.”

“Yeah.”

A silence. It endures. “What is it, Dad?”

“I just, well… I am curious how it works, is all, Sugar Puff. With two guys...”  
“We’re Vees, Dad.”

“Vees? That’s like some club?”

“No. Like the letter V. It means I am in a love relationship with each of them and they are with me, but not each other.”

He laughs suddenly, and in a way you don’t like. “Damn right! Lucky they don’t kill one another!”

You put back your scowl and turn to him, as much as to shake off his arm as to make him look at you. “Possessiveness is a side of human nature we need to evolve out of, Dad.”

“Whatever you say, honey.”

“Will you please talk to me like an adult now, Dad?” You slap the knee that before you only wanted to sit on. “Society makes us see partners as possessions—and for no other reason than some outdated religious attitudes still embedded in our post-Christian mentality. It’s not natural. Look at ancient societies…”

Instead of arguing, he surrenders into a sudden sadness and distance as he stops listening. This is the first time he looks like he used to when he drank beneath a shadow. At last he says, “You think Mom left ‘cause I was possessive?” and his eyes come up to you, hurt.

You smooth the knee you slapped and nestle your head back into his shoulder. “No, Dad. She left ‘cause you were an alcoholic.”

“Right. Yeah.”

\*

With breath like a side-on steam engine, you step outside and trudge over to the store beside the house. This morning is one of the achy ones, and you feel like you are walking in exo armour from the last Call of Duty, minus the machine oil.

You take the ‘stick with a hook’ as Jack dubbed it, and use it to open and secure the front shutter of Penny’s, the store your Mom, Penny, used to run. You resolve to call her later in the morning—she knew your father was coming out yesterday and you are a little annoyed she hasn’t been in touch already. Not making the trip is one thing—Grandpa and ma couldn’t either. But at least they called.  
A fog hangs over Sitka Sound—and you can’t even make out the end of the jetty, let alone the Kasiana Islands across the way.

You turn on the gas heater and the coffee machine, then check your watch. Still a few minutes before eight.

“Wow. Jack did a good job,” comes your father’s voice before he emerges onto the wooden platform facing the water. He gives the floor a stamp and a nod of approval.

“Yeah. He’s the hands guy. Boris is the brains—quit UAF to work. Internet security...”

“Room for some heart?” he comes over and kisses you on the head.

“Always.” You smile up a good-morning. “How was it being in your own bed again?”  
“Ok,” he says, but also not saying something else. He turns back towards the water. You wonder whether the words he held back have anything to do with Mom.

“Let me make you a coffee. Jack and Boris should be here any minute.”

“Coffee would be awesome.” He opens one of the chairs and places it beside a table, looking out at the fog as if the view were limitless. “I saw the guys were staying here before. Their shoes...”

“Not always. But, yeah.” You gulp. This conversation is only heading in one direction.

“So… we should probably talk about living arrangements at some point, I guess. Be good to use the spare rooms… You’re going to need hands, brains, heart and anything else you can get your hands on when that little storm is born.”

You bite the bullet. “Dad. I am moving out next month.”

You wish you were looking at him when you said this but you spoke to his back, shoulders hunched, a solitary silhouette in the heavy morning air. Nothing moves. The sound of a drip of dew falling from leaf to the water.

“I’m sorry, Dad. I just thought… one surprise at a time, you know?”

“Sure. Thanks.” More silence. Another drip.

You go over and sit on his lap again. “We’ve got a plot of land just up by Granite Creek. Jack converted two shipping containers. You wouldn’t believe how it looks, Dad.” You realise now is not the time for excitement. “I still want to come here every day. Run the store… If the littl’un lets me.”

“That’s good.” He stretches and yawns. Neither seem natural and you feel perched on his knee rather than nestled there. “You started making the coffee yet? Cause I think I am going to take a walk now.”

“Ok,” you say, and stand.

Tom doesn’t look back at you as he steps off the veranda and up the drive into the mist. Just waves a hand over his shoulder. “See you in a bit.”

“See you.”

And you watch him disappear into the greyness.

Heart heavy and close to tears, you go back inside the cabin store. Some seconds or maybe minutes later, you find yourself staring down at the growling gas heater warming your knees.

At last, the sound of a car. It will be Jack—Boris comes by bike. You couldn’t be more pleased to see either just now and step out of the end door towards the drive.

But it’s not Jack. A large silver SUV—uncle Jules, your Dad’s little brother—and coming down the drive only marginally slower than he would an interstate. You remember his flight was at nine and sense something is wrong even before he slams on the brakes and jumps out of the car, dressed in an oil-slick grey fitted suit and tugged-open tie.

“Hey, Uncle Ju--”

“Are your phones working?”

“What? I erm…” You reach into your jacket pocket for your phone, which your back-fold fingerless mittens make no easy operation. It never occurred to you to check whether you had a connection since waking up—you just saw it was strange you had no messages. True enough, you see now that your phone isn’t connected to the house WIFI. But, even more oddly, no data connection either. “No. No connection. Did you miss your flight?”

“There \*was\* no flight. Whole freaking airport’s closed. No explanation. Security staff just telling everyone to turn around and leave. It’s chaos.” He marches past you to the front door. “Need to check your landline. Your Pa in?”

“He’s out walking.”

You follow Jules in just as you see another car come down the drive. This one at a steady pace—Jack. You wave to him and gesture you’ll be inside, then follow Jules to the living room.

He already has the landline phone to his ear. For a moment. Then slams it down, frustrated. “Damn. Could lose this client if I don’t reach them. Tender decision is today and Rupert Sailes are bound to come in with a lower bid.”

“Erm. You tried a shipping radio?”

“Radios are down too,” comes Jack’s voice behind you as he steps in, lowering his head so he doesn’t hit it on the doorframe. Again. “Even the radio stations. Seen nuttin’ like it. And that in’t all—Halibut Point Road is closed north. State troopers put up a block—Pops couldn’t get to work this morning.”

This catches Jules’ attention. “Say what?”

“The road north is closed. Is all I know. Troopers wouldn’t say nuttin’. Leastways not to Pops.”

Jules has stopped pacing as his thoughts switch from ‘how to save my client’ to ‘what the hell is going on?’

You turn to the TV, pick up the remote and turn it on.

And gasp. Coloured bars. You change the channel. More coloured bars. You switch to cable and find a blank blue screen.

“No TV neither,” explains Jack, helpfully.

You are at a complete loss. Jules is scratching his head and pacing. Jack is just standing there, gently swaying as he does.

He shrugs more than speaks a suggestion. “Guess we could go up and look at the broadcasting tower? Dunno.”

“Satellite phone. Who has one?” says Jules, eyes lighting up.

“The Browns might have one. Dave is ex military,” you suggest with a wince. Despite being your closest neighbours, the Browns never resumed talking to your family after finding your Dad asleep in a pool of vomit on their couch after getting lost on his way back from a shadow-night at Ernie’s. “What about Bex? She safe in the city on her own?”

Jules’ look as he passes you towards the door says he hopes so.

“We could go into the city,” says Jack. “Someone’s bound to know somethin’.”

“No one I asked on the way through knew a thing,” calls Jules. “Everyone’s in a panic. Supermarket is flooded like it’s doomsday. I wouldn’t go there, Tatty. Not till things have calmed down. Stay here, okay? I’ll go get Bex after I’ve tried the Browns.” And he runs out. You hear him start his car to drive the hundred metres to the Browns’.

Jack looks down at you for your decision. You look down at your tummy.

I am from UK so I would need a visa while I was there. There are a few I looked at, one I can just travel there for a few months and not work or if I wanted to work while I was there I would need to get an employer first and have them send off an I-129 Non immigrant worker form. What are the chances of this? Are there many jobs that need filling there? I read that employment has been increasing for 25+ years. I have qualifications in IT so could do support work or literally anything I am not really bothered as long as it is enough to feed myself while I am there.

I plan to save some money and rent accommodation, buy a car for while i'm there, in one of the bigger places like Fairbanks or Anchorage. I have no where near enough money to buy any land yet, I just want to come out there and see what it is really like and hopefully make some money at the same time.

225,225,SixMillionBansEvaded,1578958520,eochod,Nan,"Hi, I've been interested in a home in Fairbanks and am wondering about the popularity of rocket mass heaters or masonry heaters. If they are approved for use in the city limits, if they are common in homes there, etc. For those who don't know, these types of heaters both have insulated fireboxes which cause an extremely hot fire, which reburn the exhaust and creosote meaning far less pollution. At the top end they are upwards of 93% efficient as opposed to wood stoves that are around 70% efficient.

Now I'm mostly wondering about rocket mass heaters, as masonry heaters have been around for thousands of years and are very popular in Russia, Finland, etc. Does anyone know of rocket mass heaters being used in the Alaskan interior (or anywhere in Alaska for that matter)? Rocket mass heaters in particular are a relatively ""new"" invention but are popular among permaculture people in Montana, Idaho, etc. 

I don't think that rocket mass heaters are, by name, approved for use anywhere in the US, but I guess in this situation it's easier to ask for forgiveness than beg for permission.",alaska,"Use of masonry stoves or rocket mass heaters, as opposed to wood stoves, in Fairbanks"

The Mrs and I scored some cheap tickets on Alaska Air for this weekend to Anchorage from Portland and we’d love any/all suggestions for 2 day trips. General activities are okay as well but so far our plan is,

-	Fly in this evening, get settled in and relax
-	Day Trip #1
-	Day Trip #2
-	Explore Inner/Downtown Anchorage and fly out late Monday PM to PDX

We’ll be renting a full size car and not planning on using any “off roads” or roads that are hazardous, as I understand that negates most rental agreements anyways. So unless recommended otherwise, it seems pointless to pay almost double for an SUV.

Budget isn’t too much of a concern, nor a decent drive (2+ hours). We have plenty of skiing here at Mt. Hood, so we’re probably not interested in that. Views, experiences, and anything unique to recommend would be awesome.

Quick question for everyone...

What do you think about the state's current stance on sports betting legalization that is rippling through the lower 48 (currently, not happening any time soon)?

For or against, what is your reasoning?

Even though I am, personally, not overly interested, I was having a conversation with a group of friends who are, and was curious as to where other people fall on the matter. The way I see it, allowing paid fantasy sports (Draft Kings/Fan Duel) but not allowing sports books is just...odd.

Personally, I prefer for government to stay out of personal decisions. If you decide to gamble, you do so at your own risk. However, I do understand the addiction aspects of gambling as well.

 1. Full Disclosure by all ruling bodies, political, judicial, military, medical, scientific and religious. We demand the complete whole truth, the good the bad and the ugly. Only then can proper decisions be made.

 2. Rewrite history with full disclosure. This will expose the atrocities of the past so we can learn from them. 

 3. Abolish all national borders. Federal borders are political property lines, useless for people living together. By limiting governed areas you increase accountability and impede corruption, your vote counts now more than ever. All ""Zones"" (City, County and Tribal populations) govern themselves according to the will of the native population with input from residents and settlers. Hong Kong, Hawaii, Alaska ect. should lead the world as an examples of zones. Native defined as over 100 generations improving the same area, resident over 10 generations, settlers under 10 generations. 

 4. Land and natural resources are no longer privately owned but leased from earths population to fund ""EMS"" (Earth Medical Service) and Zones. 

 5. Use EMS to police the Zones, replenish earths natural resources,  clean pollution, improve infrastructure and provide disaster relief. Examples of EMS could include all Health care, Forest Service, Navy, Habitat for Humanity, Green Peace ect.. All prisons become garbage recycling centers. All plastic trash carbonized into carbon fiber for road and bridge forms.

 6. All Zones taxed on resources used and waste produced. Produce more resources than you use to lower taxes. Produce no waste (solid, air, sound or water pollution that will negatively affect others) and provide more resources than you use for low or no taxes.

 7. Immediately phase out burning of fossil fuels. All nuclear waste to be expelled from earth, no more landfills or depleted uranium bullets. It's not technology if it harms earth. We must limit things competing with us for oxygen like fire, internal combustion engines, destruction of chlorophyll producers and livestock. All future decisions made with earths interests before humanities, hopefully we survive this mess. 

 8. After the year 2020 full accountability for crimes against humanity and nature. 

 9. Start teaching a sign language worldwide as a second language.  This eliminates the language barrier in business, travel and vacations.

 10. Implement a bitcoin system that uses individuals value. Use a “PTV"" (personal trade value) that incorporates a point system to include complexity of the profession, schooling, demand for service, personal ability, your feedback for services rendered and experience. Example, heart surgeon has a PTV 11 is visited by a bus driver PTV 2, bus driver is healed, doc spent 10 hours, bus driver pays 10x11 divided by 2 so 55 hours are transferred to doc account. You earn according to ability and pay according to service.",alaska,"Show us the way Aiaska, #voteneo"

We'll ship a bunch of stuff up and also likely tow a small U-haul up the Alcan. Car is a 2017 Toyota Highlander with seats that lay down, so it's roomy in the back and very reliable for the drive (likely driving summer / early fall at the latest).

Both flying and driving with cats seem like logistical nightmares for different reasons. One cat is pretty emotionally needy, the other is asthmatic w/ daily inhaler meds. They are adult female cats--6 and 8 or somewhere around there. 

We **really** don't want to kennel them for a week while we drive up as one cat has repeatedly demonstrated separation anxiety / behavioral problems during extended periods away from us (honeymoon, etc). I wouldn't want to stick them in an unfamiliar house without us as the behavioral problems can get... messy. Parents in Anch already have a cat and our cats barely tolerate each other on good days let alone strange cats.

So... has anybody successfully done the Alcan with cats? What made it easier / tolerable? What parts would you have done differently? Is there a particular carrier / food / water / litter setup that you would recommend to use or avoid?

“We’ll also be proposing legislation creating an Inspector General for the state of Alaska who will promote accountability, integrity, and efficiency in government by investigating careless and fraudulent spending across all programs and services,” he said.

I have seen a lot of ""moving to Alaska"" threads on this sub and a lot of the comments are extremely negative, and it's making me doubt myself.

I love the outdoors, and the cold. I have been hunting, fishing, and trapping almost all my life and grew up in a rural area of Missouri, nearest Walmart was 30 miles away and that's all I'd known.

For college I moved to Springfield missouri but I hate the city and I CANNOT STAND the HEAT.


I also have seen that it is ""absolutely necessary"" to have a job lined up before you get there, is this for any particular reason other than financial stranding?

I am 23, and have quite a sizeable financial cushion. 

My questions are:

1. Why are so many people on this sub trying to keep people away? Is it truly a bad place to live or are you trying to keep a Haven to yourself? (Lol)

2. Do you think that I would enjoy it, being that it seems it is perfect for my interests, or is there something I'm missing?

3. As a person who is most used to rural life, what area would be a good mix for a simple life, just making enough money to live comfortably?

I guess my next question is whether being a small and exclusive tribe have more benefits than just accepting anyone with a straight lineage? What does holding a tribe card actually mean if anything? 

Also would love to hear any stories or interesting facts about the island if you have them!",alaska,"I’ve always known my ancestry is in Atka, Ak. Just didn’t exactly know what that meant until recently."

#### By [Adam J. MacLeod](https://newbostonpost.com/author/adam-macleod/) | November 9, 2017, 9:06 EST

I teach in a law school. For several years now my students have been  mostly Millennials. Contrary to stereotype, I have found that the vast  majority of them want to learn. But true to stereotype, I increasingly  find that most of them cannot think, don’t know very much, and are  enslaved to their appetites and feelings. Their minds are held hostage  in a prison fashioned by elite culture and their undergraduate  professors. 

They cannot learn until their minds are freed from that prison. This year [in my Foundations of Law course for first-year law students](https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2017/07/law-schools-guard-entry-profession-teach-virtue/),  I found my students especially impervious to the ancient wisdom of  foundational texts, such as Plato’s Crito and the Code of Hammurabi.  Many of them were quick to dismiss unfamiliar ideas as “classist” and  “racist,” and thus unable to engage with those ideas on the merits. So, a  couple of weeks into the semester, I decided to lay down some ground  rules. I gave them these rules just before beginning our annual unit on  legal reasoning. 

Here is the speech I gave them. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

Before I can teach you how to reason, I must first teach you how  to rid yourself of unreason. For many of you have not yet been educated.  You have been dis-educated. To put it bluntly, you have been  indoctrinated. Before you learn how to think you must first learn how to  stop unthinking. 

Reasoning requires you to understand truth claims, even truth  claims that you think are false or bad or just icky. Most of you have  been taught to label things with various “isms” which prevent you from  understanding claims you find uncomfortable or difficult. 

Reasoning requires correct judgment. Judgment involves making  distinctions, discriminating. Most of you have been taught how to avoid  critical, evaluative judgments by appealing to simplistic terms such as  “diversity” and “equality.” 

Reasoning requires you to understand the difference between true  and false. And reasoning requires coherence and logic. Most of you have  been taught to embrace incoherence and illogic. You have learned to  associate truth with your subjective feelings, which are neither true  nor false but only yours, and which are constantly changeful. 

We will have to pull out all of the weeds in your mind as we come  across them. Unfortunately, your mind is full of weeds, and this will  be a very painful experience. But it is strictly necessary if anything  useful, good, and fruitful is to be planted in your head. 

There is no formula for this. Each of you has different weeds,  and so we will need to take this on the case-by-case basis. But there  are a few weeds that infect nearly all of your brains. So I am going to  pull them out now. 

First, except when describing an ideology, you are not to use a  word that ends in “ism.” Communism, socialism, Nazism, and capitalism  are established concepts in history and the social sciences, and those  terms can often be used fruitfully to gain knowledge and promote  understanding. “Classism,” “sexism,” “materialism,” “cisgenderism,” and  (yes) even racism are generally not used as meaningful or productive  terms, at least as you have been taught to use them. Most of the time,  they do not promote understanding. 

In fact, “isms” prevent you from learning. You have been taught  to slap an “ism” on things that you do not understand, or that make you  feel uncomfortable, or that make you uncomfortable because you do not  understand them. But slapping a label on the box without first opening  the box and examining its contents is a form of cheating. Worse, it  prevents you from discovering the treasures hidden inside the box. For  example, when we discussed the Code of Hammurabi, some of you wanted to  slap labels on what you read which enabled you to convince yourself that  you had nothing to learn from ancient Babylonians. But when we peeled  off the labels and looked carefully inside the box, we discovered  several surprising truths. In fact, we discovered that Hammurabi still  has a lot to teach us today. 

One of the falsehoods that has been stuffed into your brain and  pounded into place is that moral knowledge progresses inevitably, such  that later generations are morally and intellectually superior to  earlier generations, and that the older the source the more morally  suspect that source is. There is a term for that. It is called  chronological snobbery. Or, to use a term that you might understand more  easily, “ageism.” 

Second, you have been taught to resort to two moral values above  all others, diversity and equality. These are important values if  properly understood. But the way most of you have been taught to  understand them makes you irrational, unreasoning. For you have been  taught that we must have as much diversity as possible and that equality  means that everyone must be made equal. But equal simply means the  same. To say that 2+2 equals 4 is to say that 2+2 is numerically the  same as four. And diversity simply means difference. So when you say  that we should have diversity and equality you are saying we should have  difference and sameness. That is incoherent, by itself. Two things  cannot be different and the same at the same time in the same way. 

Furthermore, diversity and equality are not the most important  values. In fact, neither diversity nor equality is valuable at all in  its own right. Some diversity is bad. For example, if slavery is  inherently wrong, as I suspect we all think it is, then a diversity of  views about the morality of slavery is worse than complete agreement  that slavery is wrong. 

Similarly, equality is not to be desired for its own sake. Nobody  is equal in all respects. We are all different, which is to say that we  are all not the same, which is to say that we are unequal in many ways.  And that is generally a good thing. But it is not always a good thing  (see the previous remarks about diversity). 

Related to this:  You do you not know what the word “fair” means. It does not *just*  mean equality. Nor does it mean something you do not like. For now, you  will have to take my word for this. But we will examine fairness from  time to time throughout this semester. 

Third, you should not bother to tell us how you feel about a topic. Tell us what you *think*  about it. If you can’t think yet, that’s O.K.. Tell us what Aristotle  thinks, or Hammurabi thinks, or H.L.A. Hart thinks. Borrow opinions from  those whose opinions are worth considering. As Aristotle teaches us in  the reading for today, men and women who are enslaved to the passions,  who never rise above their animal natures by practicing the virtues, do  not have worthwhile opinions. Only the person who exercises practical  reason and attains practical wisdom knows how first to live his life,  then to order his household, and finally, when he is sufficiently wise  and mature, to venture opinions on how to bring order to the political  community. 

One of my goals for you this semester is that each of you will  encounter at least one idea that you find disagreeable and that you will  achieve genuine disagreement with that idea. I need to explain what I  mean by that because many of you have never been taught how to disagree. 

Disagreement is not expressing one’s disapproval of something or  expressing that something makes you feel bad or icky. To really disagree  with someone’s idea or opinion, you must first understand that idea or  opinion. When Socrates tells you that a good life is better than a life  in exile you can neither agree nor disagree with that claim without  first understanding what he means by “good life” and why he thinks  running away from Athens would be unjust. Similarly, if someone  expresses a view about abortion, and you do not first take the time to  understand what the view is and why the person thinks the view is true,  then you cannot disagree with the view, much less reason with that  person. You might take offense. You might feel bad that someone holds  that view. But you are not reasoning unless you are engaging the merits  of the argument, just as Socrates engaged with Crito’s argument that he  should flee from Athens. 

So, here are three ground rules for the rest of the semester. 

1.  The only “ism” I ever want to come out your mouth is a  syllogism. If I catch you using an “ism” or its analogous “ist” —  racist, classist, etc. — then you will not be permitted to continue  speaking until you have first identified which “ism” you are guilty of  at that very moment. You are not allowed to fault others for being  biased or privileged until you have first identified and examined your  own biases and privileges. 

2.  If I catch you this semester using the words “fair,”  “diversity,” or “equality,” or a variation on those terms, and you do  not stop immediately to explain what you mean, you will lose your  privilege to express any further opinions in class until you first  demonstrate that you understand three things about the view that you are  criticizing. 

3.  If you ever begin a statement with the words “I feel,” before  continuing you must cluck like a chicken or make some other suitable  animal sound. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

To their credit, the students received the speech well. And so  far this semester, only two students have been required to cluck like  chickens.

I don't have a degree, and I currently earn a living maintaining residential swimming pools here in Texas -- something I highly doubt there is a demand for in Alaska.

I'm probably going to have to find an entry level position that doesn't require much in the way of education or experience. Don't get me wrong, I'm a hard worker and a quick learner, but I don't have extensive experience in anything other than customer service, sales, pool maintenance, and oil and gas gruntwork. The latter took a serious toll on my body over the course of 5 years and I am no longer interested in laying pipe or swinging a sledgehammer.

This is weird for me because I gave up all social media years ago... but anyway, I have a roommate. This roommate is a very very good human, and she makes cookies for me and shares food with me even when she doesn't have much to share. When I met her, I learned that she's been dreaming of going to Alaska for years (since high school!) She has a lot of the gear, and is always looking up videos about Alaska and talking about how excited she is to finally go. 
Side note: I'm trying to give enough detail to explain her story but also hide enough to respect her privacy because she didn't ask for any of my meddling but alas, I meddled. &gt;:)
Anyway, back to story time. We work at the same place, but whereas I'm a full-time employee, she's technically an intern. This is unfair for a lot of reasons, because she's been at the company for longer than I have, but her group doesn't have the resources to hire a full-time employee so they've kept her on as an intern. Mind you, the difference in pay is preettyyy significant (I was an intern before joining full-time, and essentially had to live in a shed with two other people for that summer just to afford housing- the only reason we can even afford the place we're in now is because we looked for months for a cheap enough place!)
Anyway, my roommate is the salt of the earth. It's frustrating because I have to type this all out and you have to take my word for it because you haven't met her, but she is just one of the kindest people I have ever met, and I'm a pretty cynical bastard. Like, this woman made set up spare beds for three of my friends when they visited, and she even made them banana bread and left it on a cute little plate on each of their beds! AND she washed their sheets afterwards!! (I know, I should have done that part- guys, I'm just struggling to keep up 😂)
Ok back to the point- I can't believe y'all have been so patient with all my rambling, bless y'all.
I went home today and mentioned her Alaska trip and she kind of casually said, ""Oh, that's not happening anymore. That's for another time someday..."" And it pretty apparent that she was upset about it, and that money was the reason the trip couldn't happen. You know when someone's trying to pretend they're fine, but you can tell they're not?
I don't know if y'all have read The Alchemist, but I can't just stand by while someone's dream is crushed. So here I am now, asking strangers for money! So sorry to take up your time (believe me, I wouldn't do this unless it was for a damn good person like her- the Internet scares me- except for y'all of course), so I'll get to the point finally and leave this GoFundMe link here: https://www.gofundme.com/f/esv5t-dream-trip-to-alaska?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=42dcf680766b4e34b7e1029d37f4b99f

How much do you make right now?

What was your starting salary here?

How is the job market here, especially for those specializing in environmental?

My partner and I have lived in SLC UT for \~8 years. We love the winter here but but don't really enjoy anything except skiing and the mountains. Summers are brutal with the heat and lack of water you can actually swim in. We aren't city people and essentially live here to ski. Not mormon so there is that too.  Anyway - we are considering the idea of moving to Alaska for the summer to try something new. We have tossed around the idea of moving for a few years but nowhere has enticed us all that much until we talked about Alaska. We have started researching some of the towns but looking for some real advice not made by travel websites. 

I think I get the basics (not a lot of people, daylight almost all day, outdoors space is gorgeous) but what do we need to know about Alaska is we are serious about this? ie Can people afford to live working seasonal jobs? Are there realistic options to rent (we have a dog) a space for a few months? What websites do people use to find housing? Do locals dislike people who come in and work for the summer season then leave? Is it easy to meet new people?  

I'm really looking for any insights at this point. The towns we have looked into so far are Girdwood, Ketchikan, Sitka and Fairbanks. The only place we are not that interested in is Anchorage.",alaska,ADVICE plz. Thinking of moving to Alaska for the summer

I know I don't participate here much but we really need your help!

My name is Alex Trokey I live in Homer and have been doing an interview-style podcast in town here for almost a year. I found that, pound-for-pound, there are more amazing people and stories in this state than anywhere else in the US in my experience, and there is very little media coverage about how cool these people are. Most people's perception in the lower 48 is formed by reality tv, but I think we can all agree that medium is at best somewhat misleading and at worst insultingly wrong.

My co-founder and I started interviewing people in Homer and had folks all over the country reach out and say they love Alaska and the show. So we decided to expand recently to ""The Alaska Show"" and interview people all over the state across business and industry, government, culture, and athletics to talk to them about their stories and what life is really like here, as well as make other content for people who want to know more about this place. We just started this last week with the head of the Coast Guard Sector Anchorage who has some truly amazing stories and dives deep into their missions here.

Obviously we've talked to Captain Sean MacKenzie. We have also interviewed some other business owners, an ex-olympic skiier, and an Alaskan Youtuber. I know the people in Homer really well but don't necessarily know everyone in the state (although it feels like that's possible here). **Do you guys and gals know of any particularly interesting individuals, organizations or businesses I should look into to tell their story on the show?**

But moving up to Alaska with a surplus of cash and no wife or kids to speak of I pretty much just want to go balls out on a purchase.

I would ride trails when necessary but when I was able to get out to the mountains on a couple occasions I would always be off-trail. I've been looking at the Ski-doo freerides - especially now that the 2021's have a turbo available.

Also, whenever I've searched online or read other posts for things to do, the locations recommended are always all the way on the other side of Alaska and hard narrowing down ideas on what to do while there.

 \- If there was only one main city to stay in while visiting for maybe 3-5 days, which would it be? 

\- Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau? Any hotels recommended while there? 

\- Any popular yearly local events happening during the middle of July worth going to? 

\- Recommended hikes in the vicinity? 

\- Recommended things to see/do, places to eat, breweries i MUST try while visiting? Also hoping to see wildlife while there.

I'm a student from Europe and I decided to have a presentation on internet in Alaska. To get the best possible answers to certain questions, I decided to go straight to the source - you guys. I would really appreciate it if you took the time to answer any questions at all.

So, without wasting any more time, here are the questions.

1. In general, are you satisfied with your internet connection?
2. What is you internet speed? Is it the same as promised/advertised by the ISP?
3. Are there any faster options available?
4. How much do you pay for it?
5. Do you feel like it's too expensive?
6. What's your ISP?
7. Do you have a fiber optic connection?
8. Is the connection stable for most of the time (90%&gt;)?
9. Do you feel like an internet connection is a must in your household?

Does anyone know of a supplier that carries these up here?

 I tried calling SBS and they dont carry them and would have to special order them from Bigfoot, a manufacturer of some of the plastic tubes but Bigfoot is saying the shipping is going to astronomical. 

Should I just go with cardboard tubes and a good size footer? Any experience or tips with this is appreciated as it's going to be my first build.

Currently living in Montana, I will be moving to anchorage come may and I am looking into a new-to-me car. Sadly, my current car wont make the trip or the winters (or at least not up to risk it). Was up there for part of a summer a few years ago and really looking forward to being back. 

What survives year round up there? I've been looking into anything with 4wd or awd, mostly in the SUV/crossover size. I'm no stranger to winter driving, but I'm assuming itll be a bit different than winters in Montana. I'm looking to do a lot of skiing and other outdoorsy activities while I'm there (close to anchorage and down the peninsula or up to Denali), which probably wont include too much off roading but I wouldn't hate having that option. 

Any better recommendations than what I've been looking into?--  subaru outback/forester, toyota rav 4/highlander/4runner, some form of newer jeep, or a ford edge? I've been looking in the 2014-2017 year ranges for all of these cars and models. Any other vehicles I should look into? Or ones from this list to avoid? Preferences on your end?

Without going too much into detail, let’s just say my life hasn’t been going anywhere near the direction I wanted and I just feel trapped. For the past year I’ve had thoughts of moving somewhere far from here, just to be able to escape everything and start a new life. I’m undoubtedly introverted and I love nature (hiking is one of my favorites hobbies) so I wanted to go somewhere where I could have both the views and solitude. I’m a pretty simple guy, all it takes to make me happy would be a pair of boots, a little cabin, and a dog. Do those of you who currently live in Alaska think this is a dumb reason to move up there, or is it safe to say I could find my escape?",alaska,Is Alaska the right place to “escape”?

Everyone says that most of the shopping is in Anchorage, which is good to know, but I’d like to know specifically what’s *in* Seward, especially since my son gets car sick easily. 

My plan is to sell almost everything that we own in order to move up there.  My worry is that we will get there and wish we had found a way to ship more stuff. 

I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old.  Is there a place in Seward to buy diapers?  Is there a second-hand store?  Is there a place where I can buy furniture?  What about baby and toddler things like potty chairs, baby gates, and strollers?  Is it true that Amazon Prime still ships to Alaska for free, but it takes longer and most people have PO Boxes outside of the big cities?

I hear that most apartments are pre-furnished, but that doesn’t make them child-proof.  Any other advice would be fantastic!  I’m sure there are worries that will feel like no big deal once we’re there, but for now I can’t even picture it.  Thanks in advance!",alaska,Moving to Seward?

2. What's the best spot for raising a family? Schools aren't a concern, but having access to things to do is.

I’m a 30 y/o who has made a mess of his life. I’m interested in getting an Associates degree in Nursing and eventually doing s bridge program to a BSN. Penultimately I want to work in primary care in Alaska. I’m interested in moving to Anchorage but there are three variables which complicates my interest in moving.

1. I don’t have a car or driver’s license. I’ve never needed one in California due to the public transit system. Is it possible to live in Anchorage without a car during the winter months and bike during the summer?

2. How Trans friendly is the Anchorage area? Although I’m not openly trans, in California there are employment and housing protections for transgender people.

3. I don’t have any savings. Would you advice that I defer enrollment and work for a year before moving to Anchorage?

Last year I visited Fairbanks and loved that little city, but plan on maybe making the move to Anchorage because jobs/housing seems more ample, and the weather isn’t as harsh for me to get used to the cold. 

I won’t be able to move until approximately October. I plan on either taking up an apprenticeship to secure a career field while making money (possibly mechanic work, maybe another blue collar field) or finding a job in my current field (residential care for foster youth). I already have some money saved up to help support myself, but still have a few questions:

1) How much money would you recommend having saved before moving? I hope to rent a room or cheap apartment in the city

2) Are there any job fields/ apprenticeships anyone knows of that would be worth considering in the area? I’m fairly open to ideas.

Major Updates to UA’s COVID-19 Response
This week has brought major changes in the international, national and state response and characterization of the COVID-19 situation. The World Health Organization has officially characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. President Trump has restricted travel to the U.S. from much of Europe, and Gov. Dunleavy has declared a public health emergency.
While there are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Alaska, prevention is critical. In an effort to do everything we can to help keep our university communities safe and help slow the spread of the coronavirus we have convened the university’s Incident Management Team and— after consultation with the Chair of the Board of Regents, the chancellors, union and governance leaders—I have determined that the following steps are in the best interest of our communities:
• Starting March 23 and potentially for the rest of the semester, most UA courses will be offered using alternate delivery methods (online, audioconference or web-conference, etc.) rather than traditional classroom instruction. Exceptions may be made at the discretion of the chancellors for clinical, lab, and other hands-on courses where “social distance” and other personal safety measures can be assured. In addition, we are working to address issues such as computer access and other student needs in ways that maintain social distance.
• We are extending spring break by one week for students in order to allow faculty time to prepare their courses for alternative delivery methods. That means there will be no classes between now and March 23. Employees should return to work unless affected by restrictions established in separate guidance.
• We are asking students living in residence halls to either stay at their permanent residences, if they have traveled there for spring break, or to make plans to return to their permanent or alternative residences by March 17. Temporary access to residence halls will be provided to access needed personal items and study materials. The universities will provide a process to request exceptions for students who have no other residence or who cannot travel.
• We are canceling all events and gatherings of 25 people or more between today and March 31. We will revisit the situation later this month and make a decision then regarding events for the rest of the spring semester.
• We are expanding the restrictions on university-related travel.
• We are planning extra steps to clean and sanitize university facilities.
• We are staying in communication with the U.S. Department of Education and the
Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities to ensure accreditation stays in place.",alaska,UA is extending spring break and moving to distance learning

So I have had a running nose, nasty cough and fever for  about a week and missed several days from work this week.  My wife's  flight back from Oklahoma City  a week ago Sunday went through Seattle  and arrived late and she was forced to spend the night in Seattle and  got home late the next day.  I started getting sick on Thursday night.  I  went to the Tanana Valley Clinic First Care clinic today because they  told me that they would give me a corona virus test over the phone based  on my symptoms.  When I arrived at the clinic,  I put on a face mask,  but I was surprised because they took no extra precautions that I might  have Corona Virus.

My  fever has been coming and going was my body temp was near normal today  at the clinic.  My flu test was negative.  A chest xray confirmed that I  have pneumonia, but the doctor said that I could not get a Corona Virus  test, because my pneumonia was not severe enough to admit me to the  hospital.   They prescribed me with a course of antibiotics and told me  to come back in two days if I get worse.  If being so sick you have to  get admitted to the Hospital is the criteria to perform a test in the  State of Alaska, its no wonder there are no positive tests in Alaska  yet.  The doctor said that he would have to fight with the State of  Alaska Virologist to get me a Corona Virus test if I was not being  admitted to the hospital.

There had been considerable news about the Corona Virus hotspot in Seattle, so my wife was very concerned about spending any time in Seattle.   Alaska Airlines had a mechanical issue that delayed the flight in Oklahoma City to Seattle be at least 2 hours.  My wife repeatedly told the gate agents for Alaska Airlines that she did not want to fly to Seattle is they could not make sure she got her connection to Fairbanks, because she could spend the night with her mother in OKC.  Alaska Airlines personnel assured my wife that she would be able to make her flight to Fairbanks prior to boarding in OKC.  Of course, at 12:30 PM on Monday morning at Sea-Tac airport, my wife was told that she had to spend the night in a hotel in Seattle.  The hotel room was smelly and dirty.  My wife did not make it to Fairbanks until nearly 10 PM Monday March 2, 2020.  On Thursday last  week, my wife and I came down with flu like symptoms that rapidly progressed to difficulty breathing.  I was diagnoised this week at a medical clinic with pneumonia.  I cannot get a Covid-19 test due in Alaska because of the crazy guidelines adopted by the State of Alaska, but my wife and my symptoms are exactly the same as Tom Hanks described on the Television on Thursday morning.  Despite making a written complaint with Alaska Airlines and calling and leave the customer service Vice President a voicemail, we have heard nothing from Alaska Airlines about this incident.   I wanted everyone out there to know that Alaska Airlines actions have vividly demonstrated to my wife and I that Alaska Airlines has absolutely  no concern for your health and should be strenuously avoided as an air carrier option in these trying times, unless you want to spend the night in Seattle and be needlessly exposed to Corona Virus.",alaska,ALASKA AIRLINES IS UNSAFE TO FLY

A  top Kaiser Permanente executive said Sunday the large health care  organization will postpone all non-urgent medical and dental procedures  in Oregon and Southwest Washington through the end of the month,  providing only urgent and emergency care or virtual appointments online.

Kaiser  is anticipating an influx of patients amid the coronavirus outbreak and  wants to reserve its medical staff and supplies in anticipation of an  onslaught, said Wendy Watson, chief operating officer of Kaiser  Permanente Northwest. Kaiser appears to be the first major Oregon  medical provider to make such a decision, though others appear to be  considering similar steps.

Despite a positive COVID-19 test from a passenger who had disembarked  days earlier, thousands of people were allowed to leave a cruise ship  in Miami Sunday without undergoing medical screening.

The former passenger got off the MSC Meraviglia  in Miami on March 8 after an eight-day Caribbean cruise, leaving 103  passengers and the ship’s crew aboard for the next voyage. Four days  later, after the ship had sailed with thousands of additional new  passengers aboard, the Public Health Agency of Canada informed  Broward-based MSC Cruises that the former passenger had tested positive.

Two statements were released Monday concerning Alaska  restaurants in response to the spread of the coronavirus. Anchorage  Mayor Ethan Berkowitz closed all dine-in services for bars and  restaurants in the southcentral city. Fairbanks Mayor Jim Matherly  announced he won’t be doing the same.

Berkowitz’  announcement prohibits dining-in at restaurants, bars and breweries in  Anchorage, starting Monday at 5 p.m. Drive-through, take-out and  delivery services are still allowed. However, theaters, gyms and bingo  halls also were closed until March 31. Buffets and salad bars also were  closed to self-service.

Contrasting the statement from  Anchorage, Matherly’s statement said, “At this time, Mayor Matherly is  not issuing any mandates regarding restaurants and bars in the city of  Fairbanks. A mandate like that would disproportionately impact  restaurants inside city limits.” It went on to say that the state would  have the authority to close all restaurants in the borough.",alaska,Fairbanks restaurants open to dining-in during coronavirus spread http://www.newsminer.com/alerts/fairbanks-restaurants-open-to-dining-in-during-coronavirus-spread/article_d1230ce8-6826-11ea-95bf-6b45d8398e97.html

1199,1199,charlietwidget,1584478912,fkd0v9,Nan,"CORONAVIRUS-Just sent this message to the governor. I figure that my message may not be read by the government but I believe that circulating these ideas within Fairbanks is another start to getting the ball rolling.-Hello,

I am a chemistry graduate student at UAF who saw this coming a few months back and took personal precautionary measures to lessen the impact of corona in my life and the lives of others I care for. I've been very disappointed with the way the United States government along with other governments have implemented change. For instance, France thought it would be a good idea to have a curfew, but the overall outcome of such a call is that the government is promoting congestion of traffic in public spaces during non curfew hours. I've got a few ideas that have not been implemented anywhere and would absolutely help in Fairbanks and Alaska. The first obvious step is to prevent travel into Alaska from all other states not to mention other countries. The second step is to further encourage employers to strategize work schedules if workers are expected to still show up, for example have a maximum of two workers at the work place at a time in a building, or only have one worker at the work place at a given time and have employees alternate schedules and work days such that contact is diminished. Ofcoarse, sanitation of all surfaces is essential, and each employee should be responsible for the sanitation of all work surfaces prior to the next employee taking on their work shift. All together, transitioning into part time work and alternating schedules for reduced social contact in work places needs to be implemented. These are measures that need to be taken prior to a complete quarantine. If these measures are not taken the situation will get much worse much quicker and without the government making these calls and making a public announcement, a lot of businesses will be resistant to invoke any change. The last step is to inform people of what quantity of food they should be purchasing and the altruism involved with leaving some food available for others as the government does not forsee there being a lack of supplies in supermarkets. This is crucial, people will not act respectfully unless told to do so and people need to be given reasons and data to support the government's suggestions. On top of spreading necessary information another very viable option is to begin implementing neighborhood based schedules such that only some neighborhoods at a given time or day are allowed to do their essential purchases (obviously this shouldn't apply to heating fuel). This way congestion in public spaces is minimized and orderly. If this is pitched as an action plan that will keep everyone safe and as something that the community has to work on together for the well being of the community people will gladly comply. If it is simply pitched as an order without reasons or justifications it will cause panic. These steps are crucial for a remote and cold region like Fairbanks, where so many live in dry cabins and where so many people do not have enough access to accurate information. Many people live in very remote areas, hospitals here are too small and under equipped, we need to enforce serious containment efforts. Please try to consider these options when making decisions about how Fairbanks will deal with the coronavirus outbreak. We should not fail because the rest of the world is failing. We can be better than that. We are Fairbanks.",alaska,IDEAS FOR ALASKA CONTAINMENT OF CORONAVIRUS

Our general manager insists the company is doing everything to keep the employees safe, except the only thing that will keep us safe, closing the doors. Our manager said the argument for staying open is to provide sanitary area for people to eat. Otherwise, people would have to eat out in the terminal and leave a mess. I asked why we are still serving food to go if people eating in the terminal was the problem, I was ignored. I have been talked down to this entire week and told the company cares about our safety, but seems to care about staying open and making money.

Hope you all are well and safe in the face of this pandemic.   


I am coming here for some help/input before I call the mayor's office to get their input. My partner is an ICU nurse and we have been talking about ways for the general public to help as this continues to slide downhill. Earlier this week we made the tough decision to migrate our relationship to a digital only platform until we come out the other side of this pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

1. More and more of her coworkers are becoming increasingly hesitant about going home at the end of their shift, as they do not want to (potentially) take home the virus to the other members of their household. How would it be possible to hopefully get a local hotel to offer a reduced/free rate on rooms for health care workers to go after shifts? Obviously this would be diminished service, just a place for nurses, doctors, etc. to crash safely away from their families?
2. Food. This one is a pretty obvious one, food is a huge morale boost, I have taken donuts by the ICU in the past and it is always extremely appreciated by the staff on shift. Hopefully before restaurants close indefinitely we can organize some donations. Tomorrow I intend on beginning to send out messages on FB/Instagram to all of our favorite local eateries. 
3. PPE donations, obviously most or all of us saw the nixle alert from early asking for donations, but for those that missed I am hoping to start a donation drive utilizing Facebook/Nextdoor.
4. Any other potential things y'all can think of?   


Looking at other states our nurses, doctors, and other support staff are going to be in crisis mode if we at all follow the exponential trend of other states. I am hoping that somehow we as the community can support them. This is not to say there are not other industry workers who need our support, just the group that I have a biased interest in, obviously.",alaska,Health Care Workers :: How We can Help

&amp;#x200B;

So my wife and I were planning on moving up to Anchorage in mid-May and it looks like that... will probably be a bit delayed. I'm big into Tabletop Role Playing Games and I *was* planning on trying to set up a new game group when we arrived. With the recent... **stuff** that is happening, my guess is that many game groups will be migrating to online activities in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is where those communities are online? My relatively small town down in Washington has two separate Discord groups with TTRPG rooms along with its subreddit, but I haven't been able to find anything for Anchorage as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to start two games in the relatively near future (both online). One would be a more superheroic/theatrical/off-the-wall sort of game probably played in Spire, Electric Bastionland, or Blades in the Dark (4-5 players MAX with an expectation of regular meetups to play). The other game I am hopeful to put together is a Hexcrawl adventure, set in something like Dungeon Crawl Classics, Reigns, Forbidden Lands, Ironsworn, Shadow of the Demon Lord, or BRP (3-5 players per Session with no limit on total number of players and less expectation that you can make it for any particular session). Both of these groups would have to come to a consensus on the system actually being played.  


So please, hit me up with any of your recommendations for communities, OR let me know if you'd be interested in potentially joining either of those groups!",alaska,Online Alaska TTRPG Community?

*We are moving to Alaska (from rural WA), next July for a job in the southern Kenai Peninsula. We are experienced living remotely, and in the snow (albeit New England). Additionally, we are pretty comfortable shopping in bulk enough to last a month or so.* 

* **Housing** ***-*** When looking for rental are their Alaska specific questions to ask? Top /bottom floor of a duplex matter? Heating options to avoid?
* **Shopping -** Is it reasonable to plan a once every 2 months trip to Anchorage (Costco) to shop in bulk, but then to replenish perishables locally?
*  **Clothes -** People say wait and buy winter clothes here BUT then say everything is more expensive in AK. So since there are some great lists about winter clothes is it smarter to buy here vs. AK?
* **Vehicle:** I drive a Toyota Tundra RWD *and the current situation means I lost my financial opportunity to buy another vehicle.* I've driven, and hauled our TT, all over remote dirt roads, jeep trails, snowy mountain passes, etc. I (will) have a full set of studless snow tires and normally have  AT tires. Plus I've been told I drive like a Grandma. So....will this vehicle suffice for a while?
* **Recent Transplants -** We are hauling a minimal of furniture and *things.* My thought is that I can buy used furniture in AK and that Amazon still delivers. However, anything you didn't bring that you REALLY wish you had hauled up there? What was worth transporting?  (We are moving via truck and TT).

So we have bushtell in alaska near the bethel area (about 80 miles north). Anyways, between me and my husband, we are at around 102 GB. We have no data where we are at so, we are on wifi alot.

And not all the wifi we used on our phones were even at home! I work for a school and my so does my husband! So that should put us well below... idk what to do. Should I call and complain about this?

I would like to see as much nature as possible. Looking to befriend someone now and get to know them a bit for when I come! Thanks! Also how should I dress in the end of August for Alaska?

I flew through Seattle on February 29th, which seems too far away to have anything to do with this but figured I throw it out there regardless.

On Friday I started feeling really fatigued.  I’ve never felt like that before, it was worse than the flu, then the splitting migraine came.  I chalked it up to too much stress.

On Saturday I felt like I was hit by a bus.  I could barely move my body hurt so much and I was just so tired.  Walking up the stairs was absolutely exhausting.  The headache was still there and my stomach was slightly upset.

On Sunday I felt a little better but not much.

On Monday I felt almost like a new person.  The body aches were almost all gone but the fatigue and headache was still there.

I went to work today (I really didn’t want to because if I have it, I don’t want to pass it on, but I honestly cannot afford any time off work), and started to feel like I needed to sneeze.  My nose started running, and that’s when I told HR I might be having symptoms.

Well now I’m screwed.  I called TCC and they will not test me because I don’t meet the requirements and they will not give a doctors note at this time.  My boss told me to come back to work Friday.

I’ve never felt anything like this before.  It’s completely different than any cold or flu I’ve ever had.

So I’m out of work till Friday and I won’t ever know if I have COVID-19 or not or if I have passed it to others or can potentially keep passing it to others when I go back to work.

HB205  
http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/31?Root=HB%20205

- HB205 includes a pay raise for state employees
- HB205 as passed does not include immediate $1,000 payments as economic relief to Alaskans

The bill is now awaiting a signature or veto by Governor Dunleavy.

Governor Dunleavy has the authority to call legislators to any location for a special session, but due to statutes it could be 30 days before legislators are required to return.

Governor Dunleavy does have power under Alaska Statue 26.23.050 to divert funds already appropriated by the legislature for disaster relief if the disaster relief fund is insufficient.  This statue could be used to override the legislature and disperse $1000 coronavirus stimulus payments to all alaskans, but likely will not.

* Dr. Timothy Carey McKinley Orthopedics and Sports Medicine
* Apr 1, 2020

 **To the editor:**  This is a difficult time for everyone, including the staff and patients  at our clinic. I can assure you that McKinley Orthopedics and Sports  Medicine is doing everything possible to keep patients, staff and the  community safe.

Half of the 15 cases were patients who  walked into our clinic for medical care and already had the virus  without our knowledge. The sources of infection were multiple places  throughout the community and the patients were not symptomatic in our  clinic. These infections were identified because of our aggressive  policies and screenings in accordance with the CDC and Department of  Health and Social Services guidelines that we practice at our clinic to  protect you and our staff.

  

Many  of our patients have already heard from us directly, and we will be  making more contact as the situation evolves. I want to remind everyone  that the last known exposure in our clinic was on March 19, over 10 days  ago. Any staff member who was within 6 feet of these individuals has  been quarantined and has not been in the office since that time. This  information is being made public now because we have been aggressive in  testing and notifying everyone involved. If you were in the clinic and  there was any risk of exposure, you have already been notified by the  health department and our clinic. If you have any questions about your  risk or exposure, please call our office or message us through our  website.

Advisory: Your AST remains actively engaged providing support throughout Alaska and we are asking for your help keeping Alaskan families safe.
Dear Eric Clark,
Your Alaska State Troopers remain actively engaged providing public safety services throughout Alaska. While we are out doing our part, we are asking for your help, as well. By staying at home, you are keeping all of us healthier. If you must go out in public, exercise social distancing and abide all health mandates. The intention of the mandates is to caution Alaskans of the seriousness of our situation and to curb the rapid spread of COVID-19.
This is hard on all Alaskans; It isn’t easy being cooped up. We are in this together and we will get through this together. Know that your Troopers sincerely appreciate those that are following the health mandates and guidelines that have been issued.
Thank you,
Your Alaska State Troopers

**COVID-19 HEALTH ALERT**

Issued: April 3, 2020
By: Commissioner Adam Crum, Alaska Department of Health and Social Services 
Dr. Anne Zink, Chief Medical Officer, State of Alaska
Health Alert 010 – Recommendations Regarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings
Scientific evidence available to date indicates that asymptomatic and presymptomatic shedding of the virus that causes COVID-19 is occurring.  This means that people who have no symptoms whatsoever may be infected with the virus and capable of transmitting the virus to others when interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing.  This heightens the need for community-wide implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among people who are not experiencing symptoms of illness.  
The primary ways to do this are through social distancing, frequent hand-washing, and disinfecting high-touch surfaces. Another tool that may help to minimize transmission while people are around others outside of their household is the use of face coverings. Because we are experiencing a nationwide shortage of medical supplies, including facemasks, we recommend that Alaskans make their own face coverings and wear them in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) -- especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.  This recommendation aligns with current national guidance: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html 
The following measures are highly recommended for all Alaskans:

Wear a cloth face covering in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). 

Make sure the face covering covers both the nose and mouth.

Do not remove the face covering until you return home. 

When removing the face covering, avoid touching the front of the face covering (because it may be contaminated). Remove it by grasping the ear loops, ties, or bands and immediately discard or place in a designated container for laundering.  

Wash your hands immediately after removing the face covering and before touching anything else.

Wash face coverings in hot, soapy water between uses.

Do not wear N-95 or surgical masks; these are needed by health care workers and first responders.

Do not rely on face coverings as the primary way to prevent COVID-19 transmission, and be careful to avoid developing a false sense of security through the use of face coverings. Continue to follow social distancing measures, including maintaining at least six feet between yourself and others, staying at home, avoiding touching your face, and washing your hands frequently.

What is a cloth face covering? A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.
How do I make a homemade face coverings? Cloth face coverings can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost. There are a number of instructional websites and videos that people can refer to for making face coverings; two such videos are available at https://youtu.be/VgHrnS6n4iA and https://youtu.be/1r2C1zGUHbU 
How well do cloth face coverings work to prevent spread of COVID-19? There is limited evidence available on how well cloth face coverings help reduce COVID-19 transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of respiratory droplets into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing and washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions.
How should I care for a cloth face covering? Wash your cloth face covering frequently, ideally after each use, or at least daily. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:

No longer cover the nose and mouth 

Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps

Cannot stay on the face

Have holes or tears in the fabric

Most of these Heroes are working for a fraction of the rate of those in the medical field. They also did not go to school to learn how to deal with sick people. Nor did they decide, consciously, to work in a profession that exposes them to a higher risk for infection with contagious disease.

I know this current situation is breading a lot of fear and uncertainty. If you're scared right now and you don't want to go out. Please stop a minute and consider what it would be like if none of us could just drive to the store to get our supplies.

I am reading a history of Russian Orthodox missions in Alaska (*Hermann: A Wilderness Saint* by Sergei Korsun, 2012). The book was originally written in Russian and translated to English. Quoting at length a late-18th / early-19th century letter, it includes the missionaries' objection to a category of people called ""zhupani,"" described in the letter only as follows:

&gt; Men who were raised from childhood as women and fulfill all obligations of women, so that Americans [Aleutians] keep them as wives.

I've searched the term – both in English and Cyrillic (Russian is my second language); I back-transliterated it to жупаны or жупани – and found nothing. The word itself doesn't seem particularly Russian, so I would guess it is a transliteration of an Aleut term. The letter's description calls to mind the concept of the two-spirit among some Native American nations, but the zhupani seem quite distinct from my understanding of two-spirits.

Much more frequent in the book are references to the Aleuts' polygamy. I've found references to that (both polyandry and polygyny) in some resources online, but nothing that would resemble the men the letter calls ""zhupani.""

Any help is greatly appreciated!",alaska,"Hoping to learn more about people in Aleut culture called ""zhupani."""

Right upfront, let me say Alaska isn’t “home” in the sense that I was born there, or spent most of my life there. And to be absolutely, perfectly clear, I don’t mean in the middle of all of this mess. That said, when people ask me where I’m “from,” I tend to start out with Denver (where I was born) and jump to Alaska, before I get to the current part of my life.

My grandparents, which I spent a bit of time with as a child (in my formative years) were medical personnel who primarily worked in economically disadvantaged areas, but signed up to work in Inuit communities. They brought me with them and even though this was over 20 years ago, I’ve never stopped thinking about it. I don’t have delusions about how hard it might be, and I was fortunate enough to experience the swing in seasons, although I was very young. I remember panning for gold at North Pole, having my birthday in the shadow of Denali, doing painting and being visited by bears. I miss seaplanes, and sled dogs. 

I’ve been in the same state since leaving, but after all this time, I still haven’t taken to calling it home. Lately, I’ve been finding myself looking for any option to make it back. I have a strong customer service background, which really doesn’t sound like anything - but I’ve done executive roles in larger companies. I also have a background in manual work, serving for years as a site manager for barns, etc., which I really miss. I’ve also done childcare. 

I don’t mind doing guide work, camp work, corporate work, or gig work. My issue is, being in the eastern-most Midwest, there’s not a lot of opportunity to get my feet wet in any of this. So I’d need someone willing to teach me, or take a risk on me. I don’t have a degree - I’ve been through school for over a decade (I have enough credits for a B.A., and have done graduate-level coursework), on and off with working full-time, or multiple jobs, and it’s too overvalued for me right now (which isn’t to say I wouldn’t be willing to pursue it - I’d love biology, geology, or - what I really wanted to study - glacial geology - the schedules just haven’t worked with my work schedule). 

The biggest wrench in all of this is golden handcuffs. I’ve been working to pay off debt and it’s going slowly enough. Without it, I’d be more than happy to live in a camp for room and board and no income. But it’s not practical right now. So I guess the real question is, can I make the move sooner rather than later and still knock out what I need to?

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate anything you have to offer, and hope you’re all staying safe.",alaska,Moving Home

I am urging you to please think of the country. Anyone who says that we are doing great is lying to themselves and is delusional.

The only way to start healing is to vote out the assholes who have fucked us over so much.

The dems need to only take 3-4 seats in the senate and they will have the majority and can get things done.

As you may know moscow has over 400 bills sitting on his desk that have been passed by the house which is controlled by the dems while saying he will not bring them to the floor of the senate for a vote a senate I might add that is controlled by the ''republicans''.

Even if he is re-elected if the dems take the necessary seats his power is gone and he knows it.

He has called the dems the do nothing dems but these articles show that they have done alot. All bills start in the house and move to the senate and you rep is counting on you not knowing that and eating up their lies of the do nothing dems.

The only time any bills are allowed on the floor is when it is for election security so that they can block them.

So please this November Vote blue no matter who.

Also your reps name may be on the letter that 20 ''republicans'' signed asking the supreme court to overturn Roe V. Wade.

Do not forget that your rep voted to acquit the ''president'' during the impeachment and basically said he did nothing wrong.

—If you relocated from the south, how do you like it? What was the biggest adjustment? 

—if you grew up in Alaska what did you love and hate most about being a kid there?

—hows public education? (I’m assuming better than N.C. since we are chronically toward the bottom of that list)

—in general what’s the thing you hate most about Alaska? 

—how is the winter darkness? (I have depression that worsens with winter, so this is my biggest worry about moving any further north than we are now). 

—what are the positives of life there? Outside of the beautiful nature and abundant hiking and camping. How’s the culture? Are people friendly to new-comers (especially regarding kids being new at the elementary age).

State of Alaska

Friday, April 10, 2020

 

Dear State Employees,

I sincerely thank you for your continued service to our great state as we work to overcome the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. These are truly trying times. It is my great honor and privilege to lead our state and serve with such dedicated individuals.

Many of you are on the front lines in the battle against this virus. To the incredible State employees who continue working to keep the critical business of the State flowing, I thank you. All of Alaska thanks you. I know this has not been easy, but you have risen to the challenge and shown what it means to be a public servant.

Many of you have spouses, family members and friends who have been impacted by the virus. Over the past few weeks we have seen countless Alaskans lose their jobs, file for unemployment, close their businesses, lose money in their retirement accounts, and experience a general sense of uneasiness and fear of the future. Life seems so daunting during such chaos. So, what are we to do?

It is my belief that in times of such uncertainty, we – as the face of Alaska – must stand strong, find hope and chart a course that propels our State through these dark and stormy waters. As such, I have proclaimed today, Friday, April 10, 2020 as Alaska’s Day of Prayer and Hope. The power of prayer and hope, across all faiths and individual convictions, are resources we can call upon immediately when all seems lost.

I am asking you – wherever you may be – to set aside a few minutes of your day as we come together to pray for and focus our positive wishes on Alaska and all of humanity. This interfaith day of prayer and hope will allow Alaskans of all faiths and individual convictions to join as one and lift up our State.

Please join me at 2 p.m. on my Facebook page or Vimeo for Alaska’s Day of Prayer and Hope.

Thank YOU again for all you do to keep our State functioning and moving forward. Though difficult, the trials and tribulations we currently face are temporary. Together, Alaskans will prevail and come out stronger, more compassionate, and more united than ever.

God bless you and God bless the great State of Alaska.

Sincerely,

Mike Dunleavy

The conclusion there has been that it is a political decision masked by a decision of  reality and hard choices. Don't get me wrong, their are hard choices to make, but they cut small programs first, they cut programs that serve the poorer first. Already we begin to see the emptying of our public infrastructure and dramatic cuts that only damage communities like with the Ferry Highway System. But there's a silver lining in this state!

Let's face a few facts, our infrastructure exists because of military investment post ww2, and our economy exists primarily because of Oil. We are not a self sufficient state without oil and gas and we would not be able to sustain the population and consumer base without that industry. But how do we sustain ourselves on oil when we only take a minimal tax on those operations? Norway has the largest soveriegn wealth fund IN THE WORLD! We have a substantially larger offshore deposits then Norway... and yet our state is starving for money because we have let private entities make massive profits off the lands resources. Those resources will never return. We need to take majority ownership over the remaing resources. It is the only way for our state to survive. Alaska has a large upper middle class, and they are fooling themselves that larger taxes aren't coming their way. They will happily ignore the tightening budgets which affect the already underserved. But that only lasts so long... 

We could have a PDF EVERY MONTH! if we, the people, gained the value of the resources, we the people should have majority ownership in those resources.",alaska,A PDF EVERY MONTH! Austerity is coming for us.

I’m in the military so I’m just going to use 2-4 weeks of leave time and spend it in Alaska just having fun and going on adventures. 

I’ve looked into cruises, which seems like it has the benefit of not worrying about travel/excursions/food or anything but at the same time I feel like I wouldn’t get a good feel for actual Alaska since you’re limited to probably an hour radius outside of the port.

I’ve also looked into those all inclusive groups that take you out to their lodge area and take you on these adventures and what not. Which seems nice and close to what I want, but I don’t want a real commercial type of tour/experience where everything’s based around the one company and their one little area in Alaska.

I’m trying to get an experience of kayaking in beautiful lakes/bodies of water, past glaciers and wildlife, doing fishing or something from the kayaks as well as sight seeing from them. I definitely need to do some salmon fishing as I’ve heard from one of my buddies from Alaska that Alaskan salmon is 100x better than what we get on the East coast. But then maybe driving 100 miles or something to another area after a few days and go hiking through mountains and forests, and then another day I’d do trail running, and another day mountain biking. Things like that but with a lot of natural camping in a tent in the woods or something. And then for another half just staying in a town or two and experiencing life in town. So probably 4 weeks total, 2 in the woods 2 in town(s).

I'm trying to get an authentic feel on both the culture of oil field and how dangerous polar bears are to humans so, besides researching online, I'd figure I'd ask here to see if anyone has any experience with either.

My boyfriend and I have a trip to Alaska planned from Friday, August 7th through Sunday, August 16th (assuming of course that this COVID stuff dies down by then, we've had these flight tickets for months now). We were planning on the below general itinerary and would love to get any suggestions on how to fill our time, things we HAVE to do/see, restaurants, literally any suggestions would be awesome!

Friday:

Arrive in Anchorage at 3:45

Rent a car, check into a hotel, and probably spend the evening exploring Anchorage (but am open to other places to stay).

Saturday:

Drive to Seward, do a 6 hour cruise which will take most of the day. Stay somewhere in/around Seward and probably would most likely have a lowkey night after the cruise

Sunday/Monday:

This is where we’re looking for suggestions. Would love to explore the Kenai peninsula. We have some acquaintances in the city of Kenai so we were planning on visiting them, potentially halibut fishing in Homer (any suggestions of the best cost-effective ways to do this would be AWESOME).

Tuesday:

Fly from Anchorage to Fairbanks. Probably explore/stay in Fairbanks for the night. 

Wednesday:

Venture to Chena Hot Springs Resort to stay there for a night.

Thursday/Friday:

Have some time to fill here. From Chena we were planning on potentially driving (also maybe train) to make our way back down to Anchorage for our flight out. We were thinking of going to Healy/Denali and doing a river rafting trip and slowly making our way back down to Anchorage this way. Are open to any options for this part!

Saturday/Sunday:

Arrive in Anchorage by our Sunday flight leaving Anchorage at 1PM.

As you can see, our itinerary isn’t great yet and are just looking for any suggestions that you’d give to someone looking to do a trip like described above would be awesome!",alaska,First-time trip to Anchorage/Fairbanks in August

RPM International is a 8.5 Billion dollar company head quartered in Ohio.

I’ll put on my tin foil hat and venture to guess that Dan actually doesn’t care about Alaska and it is just an easy state to become Senator.

They mailed me a page stating that I was  to call them immediately.

Now today, I check my Key2 debit card and it has two deposits that are way bigger than I expected and of course  I can’t call and  get any information.  I’ve looked at my UI total and tried to reverse engineer where this money is allocated from and can’t make it work.
