Notes:

* The skeletal remains of the unidentified female were discovered on a hillside, off a dirt road on Skinner Ridge in Arizona, approximately 10 miles southeast of the Grand Canyon.
* Hair was reddish or brown but was dyed a lighter shade of brown. It was wavy, but may not have been naturally wavy.
* Teeth were in good condition. She had seven filings.
* She was found nude. The following list of clothing was found near her body. It was too big for her:A short sleeved, white cardigan.A white, cotton Maidenform Alloette bra in a size 34C.White rayon underwear in a size small with an elastic top and bottom.Brown, red, and green patterned capri pants from World Gamons GRAFF California Wear.
* Found near her body were also:An 18"" 10 karat gold chain with tiny, curb-style links.A small jar of Ponds cold cream.A powder puff with traces of suntan colored powder.A small, blue plastic nail file with the letter ""P"" indented in script and the letter ""R"" in hand print.A white, nylon comb.
* Her body was exhumed in 1962 for further examination. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children manages to make a facial reconstruction of her. No re-burial site indicated due to poor recordkeeping.

ü¶∑ Hello everyone! Starting January 13th, I will be seeing patients for dental hygiene needs in Phoenix, Arizona! We offer services at super affordable prices, no insurance accepted or needed. Your appointments include: exams, radiographs, and dental cleaning or deep cleanings (SRP‚Äôs). Cleaning, Dental Exam and Xrays are only $35, one time fee. I can see children too, 14 years and under is $25!

What's the catch? As Dental Hygiene students, we must document everything we do on you and get signed off by our instructors. Multiple visits are expected BUT with that being said, you will receive the most thorough cleaning and meticulous care ever! Please take this very seriously as my grade depends on it. 

I would be very grateful if you would consider being a patient and could help spread the word as well. It is part of my requirement to find my own patients in order to proceed through school. Please DM me and let me know if you or anyone you know would like to schedule an appointment or have any questions!

Me and u/redvelvetcake01 talked about this case a lot when she suggested it to me, and when I was searching for more information on her. They found [this comment](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/az-pima-co-hispfem-up4923-15-20-alias-maria-mendez-morales-jun08.89668/page-3#post-10335754)  on Websleuths. In case someone can‚Äôt see it, this is what it says:  


&gt; For the heck of it, I googled ""Maria Mendez Morales missing"" and found a hit that interested me.  
&gt;  
&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Ar...nepage&amp;q=Maria Mendez Morales missing&amp;f=false  
&gt;  
&gt;It's regarding a book called Mexizona. I started skimming through the book for the yellow highlights (the bits that matched my search result) and started reading around Chapter 3. The book has a girl named Maria Mendez Moralez and a boy named Diego Cruz. They first met in Altar, Mexico, she was passing through, and were urged by the local migrants to buy fake passports and pose as a married couple to get through the border into the US. There's a bit where it mentions her already wearing a ring from her fiance who's waiting back in Georgia. The fiance had worked up enough money to pay coyotes to get her through the desert.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were posing as man and wife. Donald Rizzo, 19, and Mary Rizzo, 18, from Lincoln, Nebraska. The forger added a year to both of their ages, and they were wearing matching bright red t-shirts with bold, white lettering that said ""GO BIG RED"". In the book, she was a couple months or so pregnant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Around Ch 7, a couple of guys began shooting at the coyotes and the group and ended up hitting Maria (to my knowledge, our JD wasn't shot, or pregnant for that matter). The group kept running for cover leaving Maria behind. She was still alive and hit in the leg when Diego did manage to go back to look for her. The guy that shot her was a kid named Arlen, who happened to be the nephew of the Pima County Sheriff.  
&gt;  
&gt;By Ch 11 she had passed away in the desert, pale and cold. Judging by what I skimmed possibly due to a combination of blood loss and dehydration.  
&gt;  
&gt;There wasn't much more about the character after that, and I couldn't view the entire book, only the beginning to the first page of Ch 18. The copyright is 2013 by Alan A. Larson. The book can be bought online as an ebook, which I just might do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Amazon.com: Mexizona: An American Dream eBook: Alan A. Larson: Kindle Store  
&gt;  
&gt;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mex...am-alan-a-larson/1115247862?ean=2940016785769  
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17404081-mexizona---an-american-dream  
&gt;  
&gt;/edit  
&gt;  
&gt;I started more towards Ch 1 (they actually didn't go through the gate, they got close, but never made it through and ended up doing it the old fashioned way by sneaking out) and noticed something interesting that I had forgotten all about from the few times I've passed through Nogales. Video cameras. I wonder if LE had ever went through the border's video footage of people coming out of Mexico.  
&gt;  
&gt;/edit 2  
&gt;  
&gt;I should probably clarify that this book is supposedly a work of pure fiction. I can't find any details as to whether or not it's based on a true story.

&amp;#x200B;

I also found [this comment](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/az-pima-co-hispfem-up4923-15-20-alias-maria-mendez-morales-jun08.89668/page-3#post-11682625) regarding the address and the phone number on the paper.

&gt; I'm Mexican, and I can assure that the address is a very common one.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, there's no area code in Mexico such as 770  
&gt;  
&gt;And about the other card (where ""pastores"" is written) I'd like to let you know, at least in Mexico, a ""pastor"" is only known in Christianity, not in Catholicism.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the phone number may be incomplete, there are 3 numbers missing.

&amp;#x200B;

It can mean nothing, but it can be where Jane Doe got the idea for her name, or where her parents learnt her name. The word 'Mexizona' seems like a mix of Mexico and Arizona which also made me intrigued. If the birth date on the document she was carrying is correct, Doe‚Äôs birthday would be in two days.

Hi Senator McSally,

I was born in Arizona and have spent my whole life trying to be the best Arizonan I can be, and in turn a good American. This includes simple kindness to another human of which you displayed poor ability.

The way you spoke to press member Manu Raju was wrong and embarrassing. You represent and work for the people of Arizona, and in turn America. We all understand what it‚Äôs like to be stressed out or find yourself in a fearful situation. These are the facts of life. It has kept our species alive, the ability to feel stress and fear and make the right decision. The decision to either sharpen several spears or let the buffalo run us all off the cliff.

I ask of you this:

Consider the ramifications and gravity your single vote holds. It will bind you to the pages of history.

Your single vote could hold this administration accountable. We don't need to go over the charges as the house has upheld their constitutional duty and presented them to you and your colleagues.

A great man had to die in order for you to become senator. You owe it to him and all of us to think about what path he would choose.

I never knew him, and we had our policy differences but myself and literally every other American, except for Individual 1, respected him greatly.

Is it because John McCain is immoral and deserves disrespect or it it the fact Individual 1 believes he is able to cast the first stone without any accountability?

Ask yourself these questions and decide whether to use the spear or stand by as we perilously fall off the cliff...

I wasn't raised with religion and don't identify with having faith; however, I do believe I understand what is right and what is wrong.

Do you?

Thank you for you time...I hope you will actually get to read this.",arizona,Arizona! America! Send this or something like this to every Senator you can. Here is a Martha McSally version.
282,282,Jelfff,1579357388,eqgxwy,Politics,"Over the last couple of weeks I have produced a series of **non-partisan interactive map links that can display political districts**.  This project is a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"". 

One maps shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, **including Arizona**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

291,291,Brave-Yogurt,1579391306,eqojl6,Nan,"We had a ringtail cat enter our home in Sedona and it was a production getting rid of him. Since they are nocturnal we only heard him at night and after a few days concluded he was coming in and out of the home through an entry way. After searching for any opening we concluded that he was climbing up a tree that allowed him access to our roof. Once on top of the roof he was entering through a small covered vent that had an opening into the house. We have an older home and the opening was for a now unused bathroom shower vent. We sealed the opening during the day which resulted in us trapping him in the home (he was sleeping in the home during the day and leaving at night). The key thing I‚Äôd like to highlight here is that these animals are clever and can enter through small openings. 

To trap the animal we bought a large squirrel cage but it did not work as his tail was so long that it blocked the trap door from falling all the way down allowing him to jump out and not be trapped. We moved up to a skunk trap which finally worked. One key thing we did was cover the trap with a towel. We did his as when the cage was uncovered we saw him reaching into the cage from the side with his paw eating the food. We used canned cat food which he liked. 

Be careful when picking up the trap to take him out of the home. We wore a glove and were happy with the decision as he gave out a big scream and jumped at my hand with his mouth. He also tried to claw me inside the cage. I called it his ‚Äúdeath lunge‚Äù as he knew something was up.  If I had been careless with no glove I could have been clawed or bitten.

We drove him 3-4 miles away and released him in the mountains. 

One last comment. When he became trapped there was a strong odor. My understanding is that they have strong smelling urine but I did not see any in the rafter where we captured him. Also, this was a 5 day ordeal as it took us 2 days to figure out his entry and that it indeed was a ring tailed cat, 2 days of having too small of a trap and one day to capture with the large skunk trap. During this time we saw him a few times in the rafter looking down at us. Our natural reaction was that he was cute and tame like a squirrel. Our conclusion is that you need to approach this animal as a wild animal that can get aggressive as we saw when he lunged in the cage.",arizona,How to capture a ring tailed cat

Sky harbor feels totally overcrowded and the overall vibe is just kind of dehumanizing and dull. Seems like 9/10 people are stepping over each other, not paying attention to where they are walking (looking at phone, etc), smelling of last night's cigarettes and booze, and generally looking and/or acting miserable. Long lines for everything everywhere (security, bathroom, gift store, coffee, etc) and a sense that nothing has been properly cleaned for over a week.

I'm sure people will probably say this change occurred long ago and is probably old news, but I come back to AZ at least once a year and this is the first time I've noticed it being this bad.

These Hispanic workers with whom communication isn't even possible for my folks have been acting suspicious and hostile from the start of the building project. The neighbors have also observed them doing things like looking in peoples' homes' windows, walking around on their off days to scope out the area, trespassing on people's yards, etc. 

Now my family's home was broken into and we have direct proof of it being those laborers from Etico, which we handed over to the department for the ongoing investigation. Had to secure and lock down the place (even more) at our own expense. We heard from the department that this is now becoming an increasingly common occurrence anywhere that these workers are present (not sure if that meant this company or these types of workers specifically), and people are aware, but it seems there's no sweeping crack on this yet due to it being a relatively new problem - at least out in the Sedona boonies where it used to be totally safe and private.

If anyone has any advice on proceeding further, or possibly some legal pointers on what the next best steps are, I'm all ears. I feel like given how long this has been building up into a fairly predictable scenario, there needs to be more done. And AFAIK the property line situation lawsuit hasn't been resolved yet, if there are still any ethical lawyers in AZ out there. We have the evidence, police reports, and documentation as needed.",arizona,Etico construction company workers broke into my family's home.

She is currently in a nursing home for 30 days after having a surgery. We are able to currently take care of her, with her short stint with us. (This is the long story). Medicare will not pay for conventional nursing home care. Is there a way we get coverage for her before we get her to arizona?

Lots of drama, suspense, tears, and a whole lot to root and cheer for as a viewer since who knows if they get the help then need and deserve. 

In the first season episode 1: 
mother is too sick and throws up throughout entire pregnancy making it impossible for her to find a job. Dad has 3 full time jobs and makes just BARELY over the amount acceptable to receive assistance. Mother tried to be honest with the state and gets denied twice then closed out of her applications account. Dad applies and has been waiting for verification for days but is too busy with work to devote more time to the system. By-Golly, they barely get by and wind up selling decorations, books, plants the cultivate, their computer, arts and crafts, ANYTHING they can and work hard for low wage. Times are hard and every moment is critical. Tensions are high and resentment towards our patriarchal society swells as these two have 2 months until baby is due.

Though hardly an issue confined just to r/arizona, broadcasting these places with name and location is contributing to irreversible effects on some fragile natural features that forever change the experience of anyone visiting after.

Unique features in the Pinale√±os, West Clear Creek, Sand Hills, and Marble Canyon (just off the top of my mind) have all recently been forever altered with graffiti, fireworks burns on rock, and/or crowds.  Not to mention the obnoxious temporary(ish) effects of trash, human waste, drones flying around, etc.

*Posts and replies like this always get downvoted to oblivion, but the point isn't that I (and others) want to keep these places to ourselves, but rather that motivated folks will find these spots anyway, and they're typically not the ones that lack the outdoor ethics that prevent places from being [loved to death](https://theoutline.com/post/2450/instagram-is-loving-nature-to-death).*

I only ask that if you visited somewhere ""hidden"" or pristine and want to share a photo, maybe leave some of the details out.  Broadcasting these spots on reddit, Instagram, etc. ruins it for everyone, whether intended or not.  If you're looking for special places, check out [HAZ](https://hikearizona.com/).

**tl;dr: someone (or several thousand people) less considerate than you might see your outdoor picture and want to visit.  If you enjoyed your time somewhere outdoors in our state, weigh whether sharing it is worth the karma.  r/Arizona is visited by many more people than just Arizonans.**",arizona,"Loving Arizona ""hidden"" gems to death"

&gt; 
&gt; Arizona education advocates kicked off signature gathering at the Arizona State Capitol on Monday afternoon for an initiative aimed at raising $940 million a year for K-12 schools. 
&gt; 
&gt; Supporters of the Invest In Education initiative began the process of collecting more than 250,000 signatures to get the initiative on November's ballot. 
&gt; 
&gt; A rally that drew about 200 educators and advocates was followed by the petitions being distributed to those participating in the signature gathering process.  
&gt; 
&gt; The initiative is meant to raise $940 million for education, of that $500 million would go towards teacher pay, according to supporters.
&gt; 
&gt; The money will come from a proposed 3.5% income surcharge on single filers‚Äô taxable income above $230,000 and on taxable income above $500,000 for couples filing jointly. 
&gt; 
&gt; PREVIOUS: Invest In Ed initiative would raise $940 million per year for AZ schools, supporters say
&gt; 
&gt; Advocates say the surcharge will only apply to people in those earning thresholds.

&gt; ""This initiative does not change the current tax brackets ‚Äì it simply adds a surcharge to taxable earnings in excess of $500k/$250k,"" a spokesperson wrote in a statement on behalf of the initiative.

So what I am asking of you, r/Arizona, is to create a similar note and take it to a location that is iconic, recognizably from your state, or just somewhere that is special to you. It could be at a National Park or just off your back porch. Feel free to get creative with it. All I am trying to do is compile as many of these as possible so I massively appreciate anyone who contributes.

Thank you all so much!",arizona,Hi r/Arizona! I'm looking for help from some locals with a neat project.

Every time I think I have a city picked out there‚Äôs something about it I don‚Äôt like. Visiting AZ before hand isn‚Äôt an option, so we have to live bi curiously through other people. With that being said, what town would you recommend? 

Needs and wants of the town/city: 
-An affordable living cost 
-Jobs are easy to come by 
-An affordable college/university
-Short driving distances 
-Low crime rate 
-Lots to do (shopping, site seeing, night life, outdoor activities etc) 


There‚Äôs other things on the list but this is just the ones that matter the most.

We moved into a house that was completely redone 6 months ago and are really loving everything about the state... except one thing. Around once a day we have to deal with a giant cockroach skittering around our house and it‚Äôs driving us nuts.

Over in New England you really only have roaches if you‚Äôre dirty or living in a close proximity to other people who are dirty, but you‚Äôll just have to trust me that between our cleaning habits and the fact that this place was spotless before we moved in I can promise that isn‚Äôt the case here. I have heard upon investigation/talking to co workers that they‚Äôre just another bug here much like ants or mosquitos in MA, and that most likely they‚Äôre crawling in through the ducts in my HVAC.

I guess I was just looking for some advice as to how you natives deal with this issue. I have already sprayed ortho everywhere I could physically spray it and after waking up to one in our bedroom I sealed off the vents to this half of the house. This doesn‚Äôt seem to have solved things (obviously) and I really want to get on top of things before they settle in here permanently.

I know this isn't your average hiking/camping/review post, but I'm looking to source some local products from the Grand Canyon area and wanted to get some suggestions from people who spend their time there. We're especially seeking culinary products that don't require refrigeration. We are thinking about herbs and teas, but are open to neat household items, beauty products using local ingredients, accessories and more. Our demographic is 35-65 year old women, and we are going to need to buy the items that we go with in bulk. It can't be too large or expensive ‚Äî we're wanting to work with a company that can do bulk discounts. It would be extra cool to work with a company that gives back to the community some how, or POC or female-owned business. I've done lots of research online, but figured maybe the reddit community could help. Thanks so much for any suggestions!

in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

This spotlight is on - **[Lake Havasu](https://www.golakehavasu.com/visitors-center)**

[Lake Havasu City](https://www.lhcaz.gov/) is located on what is known as ""Arizona‚Äôs West Coast,"" just three hours‚Äô driving time west of Phoenix, 2¬Ω hours south of Las Vegas and four to five east of the Los Angeles area. As part of the northern and western limits of the Sonoran Desert, Lake Havasu City and the surrounding area feature outstanding biodiversity absolutely loaded with beautiful experiences.

The area attracts 835,000 visitors annually with its historic London Bridge, pristine lake, friendly community, [abundant sunshine](https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/lake-havasu-city/86403/weather-forecast/2123871) and [annual events](https://www.golakehavasu.com/events), ideal weather and wide range of restaurants and lodging. More than 400 miles of stunning coastline offer exceptional watersports, including fishing, skiing, kayaking and house boating. Visitors can also explore the lake from the [beautiful beaches](https://www.golakehavasu.com/beaches-and-swimming), [campsites](https://www.golakehavasu.com/camping) and [hiking trails](https://www.golakehavasu.com/hiking). 

Rated as one of the top 100 best bass [fishing lakes](https://www.golakehavasu.com/fishing) in America, Lake Havasu is ideal for catching large and small-mouth bass and renowned as a striped bass fishery. The Lake Havasu region is also host to extensive [off-road trails](https://www.golakehavasu.com/off-roading) and undeveloped stretches of river.

Lake Havasu is a large reservoir formed by [Parker Dam](https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=207) on the Colorado River, on the border between California and Arizona. Lake Havasu City sits on the lake's eastern shore. The reservoir has an available capacity of 619,400 acre feet . The concrete arch dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1934 and 1938. 

The lake's primary purpose is to store water for pumping into two aqueducts. Prior to the dam construction, the area was home to the Mohave Indians. The lake was named in 1939 after the Mojave word for blue. 

Robert Paxton McCulloch was an American entrepreneur most notable for purchasing the old [London Bridge](https://www.golakehavasu.com/london-bridge) and moving it to one of the cities he founded in Arizona. Lake Havasu sparked the imagination of McCulloch, who purchased 3,500 acres of lakeside property along Pittsburgh Point, the peninsula that eventually would be transformed into ""the island.""  The bridge was completed in 1971 (along with a canal), and links an[ island in the Colorado River](https://www.golakehavasu.com/the-english-village) with the main part of Lake Havasu City.

___

* Lake Havasu has always been a popular [spring break destination](https://www.golakehavasu.com/spring-break-party) spot for both Arizona and California residents.

* The [Havasu National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/havasu/) is located at the upper end and upriver. [Lake Havasu State Park](https://azstateparks.com/lake-havasu/) is along the eastern shore in Arizona. The [Bill Williams River National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bill_williams_river/) extends southeastward up the riparian zone of the [Bill Williams River canyon](https://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/bill_williams_river/canyon.html) from the southeastern end of the reservoir and dam.

* Want to take a little drive and visit an old mining camp turned into a bar?  It's a hoot!  Look up [The Desert Bar-Nellie E Saloon](http://www.thedesertbar.com/)

* [Stargazing](https://www.lakehavasuastronomy.org/) is great most of the year in Havasu!

* Outdoor recreation is plentiful in Havasu.  [Watersports](https://www.golakehavasu.com/Water-Based) of all types are probably on every list even in the hottest months but there is plenty to do for everyone.  Check out the [Go Lake Havasu](https://www.golakehavasu.com/) page for every possible activity, hotel and hotspot.

They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results. This poll will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

As a citizen of the Verde Valley, it is sickening to see the amount of selfishness and inconsiderate actions that are being perpetuated against our local customer service employees at retailers around the valley. They are not responsible for products not being available, i.e. products on the shelves of your local supermarket.They work for a company that has policies and procedures that must be followed. The check-out attendant is NOT the CEO of the company that makes company-wide policies, they are your neighbors, family, and friends that need to work to provide for their families.

The reason that there is no TP, sanitizer, or cleaning products on the shelves is because of YOU, not the store they work at to provide you service.

These employees are members of our community, and are working as diligently as they can to ensure that the products you need/horde are present on the shelves when you patronize the establishment that they are employed at. THEY ARE NOT THE ENEMY, OR OUT TO GET YOU! They have families too, and it is very frustrating to see all of the staple products leave the shelves before close of business, when they are allowed to purchase products that may be needed to sustain their own households.

They are doing the best that they can during a situation that has been instigated by your fellow citizens. The store is not ""out to get you"" because there is no TP available when you arrive, it is because your neighbors and friends are panicking and emptying the shelves of necessities needed by everyone in your community. 

If you are one of the patrons that are frustrated that the shelves are empty, DO NOT take that frustration out on the ones that are trying to serve you. Instead, reserve that anger for your own community members that feel that their well-being is more important than their neighbors.

We should be coming together in this crisis, and ensuring that ourselves, and all of our neighbors, are equipped to weather the coming storm.

If you are not looking out for your neighbors, those who have been and will be an indispensable member of OUR community, you are part of the problem.

It is a difficult time for all of us, and it does not need to be exasperated by fear and paranoia. 

My point of this whole post is that we should be thanking the employees at businesses that choose to show up for their shift at supermarkets and service businesses during this time to ensure that the whole community is provided with the best service they can provide during this uncertain time, not ridiculing them because the one thing you wanted is not available.

For the record, I had some symptoms of Covid-19 but have not been able to get the test. I am under 30, so it won't do much to me. I had: minor difficulty breathing, mucus, cough, significant malaise, nausea and tiny bit of diarrhea. Tested negative for flu, chest x-ray showed a bit of blockage.  I rarely get respiratory illnesses without having been someone who takes many precautions - especially not lower respiratory infections. Then, this highly virulent disease comes around and I get sick? I am on the mend and will get the antibody test and regular test as soon as I possibly can.

This is changing from a way to identify if we have exposure, to actually reducing the spread. 

I know everyone has been flooded with closures and fear, but this is a step in the right direction. Keep your head up and hands clean Arizona. I intend to send some specimens to the new lab later this week or early next week and will update if they keep their word on timing.

This is something I remember when I was little, hiking with my dad somewhere here in Arizona. A little ways beyond the trailhead was something called, well something like ""devil's *blank*"", maybe kitchen, or pantry? Doesn't help that I can't remember what *it* looked like, but it was some kind of unique rock formation. The terrain was where you're walking on big rocks, but not climbing up and around big boulders. This area itself had large, tapered rocks you had to hop down, like a big wide staircase. The rocks had a slightly reddish tinge. And this hike was in a chapparel forest, surrounded by mountains.

I'm thinking this was either near Sedona or Payson, but I'm leaning slightly more towards Payson because of the surrounding mountains, which could possibly had been the Mogollon Rim.

I am a college student whose permanent address is in Texas. I'm also in the process of getting hired by the school here, but i've been struggling with this [Arizona form A-4.] (https://gao.az.gov/sites/default/files/APG_V_C_a_A-4.pdf) My problem is that I'm not sure if my income from working back in Texas will be taxed and counted towards the standard deductible on income taxes here. I've already referred to the [Arizona Department of Revenue's Page for filing status of non-residents](https://azdor.gov/individual-income-tax-filing-assistance/determining-filing-status-non-residents-part-year-residents), but I'm pretty new to working, especially with state income taxes (no state income tax in Texas) and was wondering if Arizona counts the income I make from Texas toward the standard deductible, and if it does, is that income also taxed?

As of 3/26/20, it is reported that Arizona has had under 1,000 tests done for Covid-19 across the state. This reflects both positive and negative results. 

Arizona has a population around 7.17 million, yet there has only been 924 total tests done with results as of 03/26.  There are only three other states that have had less than one thousand tests conducted, with Arizona being the most populated state among them. 
Missouri has a population around 6.12 million with only 871 tests done.  Maryland has approximately 6.04 million residents with 674 tests consucted.  Delaware has a population of nearly 970K with only a reported 166 tests completed. 

Many people have attempted to get tested and have been turned away, due to lack of tests.  Oftentimes, unless they have had contact with someone who has been confirmed to have Covid-19 and are also showing symptoms themselves, people are being turned down due to lack of tests available. 

Please do your part by ensuring you wash your hands, social distance, and shelter in place if possible, even if the state hasnt announced to do so.  We can all do our part to help eachother by making healthier decisions and choosing to think of your fellow people when you must be out in public.  

There are people working in the health industry, in retail, in banking, and in other essential job roles that require them to continue to work during these trying times, and causing them to have less access to essentials like toilet paper and food when they try to shop after a long day of work.  One small act of kindness can impact another person/family in ways you cannot imagine!  Let us all try to take actions that will pull us together (figuratively, as social distancing is essential)!  Please think of your family, friends, neighbors, peers, and strangers before making a decision to go out in public, or before you buy that extra bag of essentials/food to store causing someone else to not have any, before yelling at that essential worker just trying to do their part to keep Arizona functioning, and before you step out of the house and decide if you really need to see that friend even tho you feel a little unwell!",arizona,Arizona severely under testing for Covid-19.

We're making new chat thread on this specific topic and pinning it every few days. We're getting a lot of ""this is what's happening to me"" posts, and we would rather have them all focused in one place so we can keep new posts mainly for information or discussions we haven't had yet.

####Other News

*  Lots of new people visiting the sub which is great overall but has resulted in a few more trolls.

* We try to keep an eye on new posts throughout the day, but it's been exhausting. Lots of duplicate posts and new users dropping threads without seeing what's already been posted.

* **All COVID-19 posts** are being held for mod review at the moment to try and curb spam and flooding of posts. There are a ton of people who have never posted in the sub before swooping in to drop their Very Important Links.
 
* Probably going to refresh the COVID thread every 3 days or so now. Will do it faster if we go on lockdown.

* Speaking of which, that rumor comes up daily that we're going on lockdown and until there's proof we are considering it a rumor and removing it. It scares people, which I think is the point behind spreading it. If we miss it somewhere, please report it.

* We're allowing common threads to be reposted every few days (e.g. What restaurants offer take out?) within reason.


Be good to each other out there.

**-  Countless fillings, three of which popped out within days.** One in particular cracked my front tooth and is chipped. It is now infected.

**-  Deep cleanings.** I've experienced dental infections and still have them, regardless of how much I brush and floss. I went to a dentist in Tempe/Chandler who did scaling and root planings (can't spell) and I paid out of pocket to get that done. They didn't clean the blood, nor did they give me an antibiotic or rinse for my mouth. No aftercare. Come to my next appointment: the dentist told me it was never done and that it would take thousands of dollars to fix. I, (24f at the time) bawled.

**-  Braces.** My sperm donor, due to the divorce decree, had to pay for my braces. He stopped paying for them and fled the state, so the dentists left my braces on for over three years before removing them. They didn't bother to clean them, either.

**-  Tooth reshaping.** One dentist shaved my front teeth to nubs because I could not afford crowns.

**-  My wisdom teeth need to be removed.** I believe they are infected. Last dentist would not touch those because they 'weren't important.'

I was also treated as a child who never learned to brush their teeth, and due to my crippling depression and anxiety, I became the one who did not brush. I do now, but it hurts because my teeth are affecting my overall health. I lost weight over this and now I am 90-95lbs on average. I can barely eat food, now and I'm worried the infection is affecting my sense of taste.

I've called and emailed dentists, but they aren't willing to look at me and some have closed because of the COVID-19 nightmare. I just want my teeth to be fixed, even if I have to get veneers/implants, but being poor/broke/struggling means I have to be in the back of the line, these days.

It's screwing up every aspect of my life and I need to fix it. I wish someone would help me. And I won't want to get yelled at/lectured/beaten down again, I just want them to take the x-rays and HELP ME. I can't take the anxiety and my teeth are ruining my life!

 Amid ongoing social distancing and implemented bans on public gatherings, blood drives around the country were forced to cancel at a time when donations are especially crucial. Now the Arizona Cardinals are stepping up to host a blood drive at State Farm Stadium.

The Cardinals organization has teamed with Cigna and Dignity Health to hold a massive drive at State Farm Stadium March 31. The event will remain in accordance with mandated guidelines to avoid crowds by spreading stations throughout the stadium. Donations are also by online appointment only, which opened up registration Thursday and reached its max capacity in less than 24 hours.

‚ÄúThe enthusiastic and immediate response from the community for this blood drive has been overwhelming,‚Äù Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill said in an official [**statement**](https://www.azcardinals.com/news/state-farm-stadium-cardinals-march-31-helping-host-blood-drive). ‚ÄúWe are so grateful to those who have registered to donate as well as to our [(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/03/arizona-cardinals-to-host-blood-drive-at-state-farm-stadium/)",arizona,Arizona Cardinals To Host Blood Drive At State Farm Stadium

I'm quick learning but I learn by doing. I have worked in a few different industries. Ive worked as a line cook and a prep cook and dish pit in some bar/grills Pulano's pizza and wings and fletchers bar as well as bennan's pub being two of them. I have also worked various labor fields. I can do basic drywall hanging and patching, I can hang shelves and cabinets \[with a partner on the cabinets\] I can also do roof repairs and a lot of handyman work. I dont have my own vehicle but I will find my own ride if needed. I work better on teams to be completely honest. I also have a bit of experience in the carwash industry, in fact the only thing I havent done at a car wash is cashier, ticket writing, and management duties. I can diagnose a great deal of problems with computers and mobile devices. I'm not a coder or certified tech or nothing cool like that but ive been around computers since I was 10 ive built a few sold a few and overall can say I myself have never encountered a computer problem I couldnt resolve in time. I have a great sense of detail and take redirection and criticism well cause a job is still a learning moment. Im also very motivated, the goals I have require me to be as such. All I need is a chance. You show me how to do the job your way and I will do it that way as the job requires.

We're making new chat thread on this specific topic and pinning it every few days. We're getting a lot of ""this is what's happening to me"" posts, and we would rather have them all focused in one place so we can keep new posts mainly for information or discussions we haven't had yet.

####Other News

* Unemployment topics are becoming more common, so we'll do a focused thread on that shortly.
* We continue to ban more people for posting about rumors. There is exactly zero amount of ""I didn't start the rumor I just heard this"" or ""I know it's true but can't tell you the source"" that will get you off the hook on this. Don't post info without proof.
* Also please don't editorialize headlines. That's a long-time rule here anyway, but it doesn't help discussion. Post the article and exact article title and then give your thoughts in a comment.
* All COVID posts are being held for mod review at the moment to try and curb spam and flooding of posts.
* Probably going to refresh the COVID thread every few days or so now. Will do it faster if we go on lockdown.
* In general the mods have less tolerance for bullshit, trolling and shenanigans than ever before.  You may or may not get a warning before being banned.

Be good to each other out there.

**If you post unverifiable rumors of lockdown, bank runs, or anything else you will be banned.** These rumors are dangerous and have been circulating for days now. Post a news source for any claims like this or _do not post them_.

Remember that /r/phoenix /r/Tucson and r/flagstaff are all active subs and may be better for your post than here if you live closer to those areas.

We're making new chat thread on this specific topic and pinning it every few days. We're getting a lot of ""this is what's happening to me"" posts, and we would rather have them all focused in one place so we can keep new posts mainly for information or discussions we haven't had yet.

####Other News

* We continue to ban more people for posting about rumors. There is exactly zero amount of ""I didn't start the rumor I just heard this"" or ""I know it's true but can't tell you the source"" that will get you off the hook on this. Don't post info without proof.
* Don't editorialize headlines. That's a long-time rule here anyway, but it doesn't help discussion. Post the article and exact article title and then give your thoughts in a comment.
* All COVID posts are being held for mod review at the moment to try and curb spam and flooding of posts.
* In general the mods have less tolerance for bullshit, trolling and shenanigans than ever before.  You may or may not get a warning before being banned.

Be good to each other out there.

**If you post unverifiable rumors of lockdown, bank runs, or anything else you will be banned.** These rumors are dangerous and have been circulating for days now. Post a news source for any claims like this or _do not post them_.

Both that reasons are negative for you life. Urgent work, tight schedule, corporate rules and lost profits could force us to arrive to work in the early hour. The same for great distance or traffic congestion. To avoid it we should depart in advance.

According to ACS 2018 (5 years), the most popular time to leave home to go to work is the gap between 6:00 am and 8:30 am (57%). The survey on this issue uses data on **143M** workers. The day is divided into periods of similar volume (for total US), but for states the situation could differ:

* 6:30am and earlier - **23%**.
* 6:30am - 7:30am - **25%**.
* 7:30am - 9:00am - **29%**.

Me and my husband are dog owners, coming from Virginia to Arizona, by the end of 2020.

Our dogs are - a Beagle, and a German Shorthaired Pointer, extremely active, psycho-breeds, that are very curious and need a lot of exercise. Gladly, here in Virginia the weather is very nice, we got plenty of choices where to go for runs and hikes: beaches, forests and, literally, fields. Wildlife, also, isn't as brutal as in AZ. So, please, I would love to ask an advice on how to...  
\- Keep up with outdoor physical activities; where, when and how (any safe outdoor land like fields for runs?)  
\- Protect the dogs from predators and other dangerous animal, poisonous insects?  
\- Deal with heat: did your dogs adjust quickly or you'd say they had to sacrifice their activity?  
\- Search for a property with a big backyard: are there any certain areas where they have houses with big lots, but smaller houses?

I‚Äôm from SoCal, and I will be moving to AZ for graduate school this Fall in Glendale. I just found a 2-bedroom condo that is in Anthem. It‚Äôs 20 miles from campus (15mins without traffic and 25mins with). Driving to campus would be driving with traffic. The rent is $1050, 1200 sqft, gated community, garage, pool, some utilities (sewage, gabage, and maybe water) paid by the owner, no pet deposit. 

Honestly, this is the first house that I‚Äôve found and contacted. I‚Äôm still really early in my process of searching, but I‚Äôm afraid I might lose it if I don‚Äôt put down the deposit soon. 

Coming from SoCal, housing in AZ seems like living in heaven to me tbh.. but I know I have to judge things with AZ standard. I‚Äôve talked to some people on my school‚Äôs forum, but I still want some broader perspectives here. 

The only con for me so far is that 25 mins commute may be considered a long commute in AZ? I will be living far from the fun activites in central Phoenix, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll engage in those activities as much or as frequently.

250,250,AZPeakBagger,1587055487,g2iiwr,Coronavirus,"Curious to see what others think Arizona will look like in 6 months to a year after the dust settles.  

Personally I think commercial office space leasing will greatly decrease.  Companies that were looking for spaces for 100 desks will now be looking for spaces for 10 desks.  Telecommuting will take off.  My wife's job that required her to show up to the office once a week has told her that it might be July or August before she needs to report in person again.  White collar workers in many industries work from home and show up 2-3 times a month for an office meeting. 

We were already telecommuting before the pandemic hit and our employer's only requirement is that we had to live within 120 miles of the main office.  So we moved to Tucson two years ago and live in a nice Gilbert/Chandler type upper middle class neighborhood but pay a third or half as much as we would for housing.   This may spur more people to do the same thing, live a 90 minute drive away from your office in order to have more affordable housing or other amenities. 

I'm giving all of my favorite bars and restaurants a 50/50 chance of survival.
