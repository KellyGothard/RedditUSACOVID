I would like recommendations in regards to (if you all have it):

-Camping, from my understanding it's alot of public land so in essence I would be able to go camp anywhere out there correct?

-Any roads that I should or should not take

-Anything interesting out there worth visiting

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* The naked body was found face-down near Arroyo Grande Road in Henderson, Nevada.
* She had been hit in the back of the head with a blunt object believed to be from a roofing hammer or framing hammer, although this did not kill her. She was beaten in the face. She was then stabbed multiple times in the back and head which ultimately killed her. One of her lower teeth had been knocked out in the attack. 
* She had been killed only hours earlier and although she was found nude, there was no evidence of sexual assault.
* The body appeared to have been washed and a piece of the shower curtain was found near her body.
* She had light brownish-blonde, 11-inch hair.
* Her eyes are commonly listed as blue but could have been green or hazel.
* She had a very recent tattoo on her right forearm of the letter “S”.
* She had a vaccination scar on her left bicep.
* She had a birthmark on the lower left side of her back.
* She had a noticeable gap between two of her upper-right teeth (this may have occurred post or perimortem).
* One tooth had a suture, a technique used to straighten a tooth.
* Her wisdom teeth were impacted.
* She had dental fillings in some of her teeth.
* Her fingernails were painted silver.
* Her ears were pierced.
* Isotopes testing was apparently scheduled according to the Henderson PD in 2016 but the results weren’t made public.
* Several television shows broadcasted the information about her and her case.
* The body was exhumed at least four times for further investigations – in 2002, 2003, 2009, and 2016.
* The case was reopened in 2015.  


Theories:

* Her case may be linked to Sahara Sue. Sahara Sue, was an unidentified woman found dead in Las Vegas on August 14, 1979, a year before Arroyo Grande Jane Doe and in apparent similar circumstances. 
* She may have been attacked while showering, hence the piece of shower curtain found near her, and the skin recently washed.

 Organizers of Burning Man announced ticket prices for the 2020 event and apologized for issues with the 2019 sale.

The San Francisco-based event, which will run for nine days in the Nevadan desert from August 30 to September 7, will head on sale next month. Ticket and vehicle prices are on the rise, with main sale tickets and directed group sale tickets at $475 – a $50 increase from last year – and vehicle passes up $100 from last year at $140. While tickets head on sale in April, some tickets will start becoming available over the next month. The main sale sells the most tickets, however, and is also known to sell out almost immediately since 2011.

I'm going to be presenting Matthew's case in parts, as it's a complex case.

Part 1 is introducing redditors to Matthew's case, tell you about who he was and where he ultimately lost his young life. (19yrs at TOD)

**Short brief:** I am presenting Matthew's case on behalf of his loving family and friends.  This case is over 30 years old. Deciding to present Matthew's case publicly and on reddit was not a light decision.  His family and friends have suffered tremendously and there is a level of real fear on speaking about his case. I ask that you **Please** be respectful in your comments.  Unfortunately, you will not find any news reports on Matthew's case. The only thing I've been able to find is a short blip on LVPD unsolved cold case page, which I will link below. Literally all the information I will present to you is from his immediate family and close friends.  I've poured over official documents from the U.S. Air Force, as Matthew was active duty when he was murdered. I am a retired AF veteran and want to do whatever I can to bring justice for Matthew, his family and friends. 

Here we go.

**Is it really a mystery of who killed Matthew Lee Dane? You decide.**

Matthew Lee Dane was discovered deceased on 8 Sep 1986 in Mt. Charleston-Deer Creek Canyon area, north of highway 158 on Champion Road.
The location of Matthew's body is approximately 40 miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV, where he lived.

Matthew had been ambushed, his killer shot him 6 times with his own weapon. Shot three times in the chest (heart) area, as well as the back and his left side.  

**Who was Matthew Lee Dane**

Mathew was born in Fredricktown, MO on 10 July 1967. He was the second precious son of hard working Missourian natives.  Matthew's mother was a stay-at-home Mother and his father was an accountant for the St. Joe Minerals Corp. He was the middle child, with an older  brother and younger sister. His loving parents have been married more than 56yrs. Matthew grew up in Viburnum, MO. He attended Viburnum, MO High School, class of 1985.

Matthew joined the U.S. Air Force right after high school, on 21 May 1985. After graduating bootcamp and his technical school he was stationed at Nellis AFB, NV. He arrived on Nellis AFB, NV in Sep 1985.

**Matthew's Marriage**

Matthew lived in the Airman barracks on Nellis AFB, NV until he was married, then moved off base into an apartment with his wife. 

Matthew Lee Dane got married to a girl (will not be revealing her name) who grew up in an adjacent county to the county Matthew grew up in (Iron County) on **17 May 1986**

Both Matthew and his wife were skilled with firearms and would go target practicing often. It is of note, in particular Matthew registered three guns with the 554 SPS Armory on Nellis AFB, NV on 6 Sep 1985. The three firearms registered were:

**A .22 Caliber Ruger (Rifle),** a .243 Caliber Remington (Rifle) and a .12 gauge Browning (Shotgun). 

It is documented that Matthew arrived at the 554 SPS on 2 Jun 1986, reported to personnel he was **NOW** married and requested custody of his weapons to be stored in his off base residence.  (16 days after his marriage)

It was clear to Matthew's family and friends by mid summer 1986 his marriage may be in trouble. 

The M.E., Dr. Chase stated he couldn't provide a TOD, however he confirmed that Matthew had expended .22 Caliber bullets recovered from his body and they were released to the LVPD.

**Day of Disappearance: 7 Sep 1986**

Matthew's wife stated she last saw Matthew on 7 Sep 1986, at a local 7/11. (I will be detaining her statement more in Part 2.)

Welcome back. In Part 2, (if you haven't read Part 1, I've linked it below and encourage you to read it), I'll be explaining about the Murder of Matthew Lee Dane - Sep 1986 - Mt Charleston, NV, the crime scene, former wife's statements and an eventual arrest and indictment for open murder charges, of person the family, friends and myself absolutely believe is responsible for Matthew's murder. I will be revealing her name as she was and remains the only suspect in Matthew Lee Dane's murder. Per Detective Hefner with LVPD, as of 30 Jan 2020.
(Even though a news article mis reported that she was acquitted of the charges or found innocent) AFAIK, a grand jury's responsibility and scope of authority is **not to acquit or convict a person** , rather decide If there is, in their collective majority opinion , enough evidence of probable cause to support criminal charges.

Matthew and his wife had 2 vehicles, until labor day weekend 1986.  Matthew had just sold his truck back to his father. It’s the reason they were home in Missouri the weekend before the killing on Labor Day. They drove the truck back to Missouri and sold it back to his father. Then Mr. Dane Sr. flew the couple back to Las Vegas on 2 Sep 1986.

Matthew wanted to be with his family to celebrate Labor Day and to wish his parents a happy 23rd wedding anniversary, that was upcoming on 7 Sep 1986. Matthew assumed his wife would visit her family as they were local as well, however she never left the presence of the Dane family.

So at the time of Matthew's murder they only had one car. It was an **older light blue Monte Carlo, alleged to be a 1979.**

**Two of Matthew's Wife's Statement** 

**LVPD Homicide Report:**

**Sally Ann ""Adams"" Dane**  (SAAD) told detectives that she and Matthew woke up on Sunday, 7 Sep 1986 and attended church at the Trinity Temple Center for 11:00 service. Upon leaving church they proceeded home to **change clothes.**  Afterwards they went to Long John Silvers on Charleston Blvd. Then proceeded to Mt. Charleston Ski Area arriving at approximately 1:30-2:00pm. 

SAAD stated they stayed an hour, an hour and a half. Departing Mt. Charleston Ski Area 3:30 would put them back in Las Vegas at 4:45-5:00pm

SAAD stated they arrived at the 7-11 at the intersection of Nellis Blvd and Charleston Blvd at 4:00pm.  SAAD stated Matthew entered the 7-11 to pay for his gas. 

Upon returning to their vehicle from the 7-11 SAAD stated Matthew was going target shooting with someone he met in the store.  SAAD further stated, Matthew retrieved his weapons from the trunk of their vehicle placing them into the vehicle of an another person, unknown to her.

SAAD told detectives Matthew departed the 7-11 with an unknown person but she couldn't recall the color or make of the vehicle Matthew entered. Sally continued that she did not see the other individual Matthew was going target shooting with. Stating it was ""common practice"" for Matthew to often go out shooting.  SAAD reported she last saw her husband at 4:00pm

**Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AF OSI) Report**

SAAD stated she and Matthew woke up on Sunday, 7 Sep 1986, departed Las Vegas at 6:45am to the Mt. Charleston area. They had breakfast at 8:00am. They departed 11:45. Arrived 7-11 at Charlotte and Nellis Blvd at 1:00pm. SAAD stated she last saw her husband at **1:00pm.**

In LVPD report: SAAD stated she last saw her husband at 4:00pm

In AF OSI report: SAAD stated she last saw her husband at 1:00pm


**Crime Scene**

LVPD received a phone call at 1400 (2pm) stating two civilian hikers had found a deceased body of a white male on Champion Road, in the Mt View area.

Matthew Lee Dane's body was found on a mountain road, Champion Rd, by two hikers on Monday, 8 Sep 1986. Matthew had been shot 6 times. IMHO, Matthew was ambushed by his killer. He was shot 3 times in the chest (heart area) on the back and side. He was initially, tentatively identified by AF2, Active Duty Identification Card. A later comparison of Matthew's dental records from, Military records confirmed his identity 

7 days later on, Sunday, 14 Sep 1986, 2 weapons were discovered by hikers, 1.9 miles from the crime scene. Checks with NCIC system determine the weapons belong to Matthew.  

On 3 Oct 1986, LVPD criminal laboratory conducted an analysis between the weapons discovered belonging to Matthew and the projectiles received from the M.E. conclude a **postive** match and determine Matthew's **.22 Caliber (Rifle) to be the murder weapon.**

On 13 Oct 1986, laboratory analysis (fingerprint comparisons) had been completed.  The LVPD detectives stated two sets of fingerprints had been identified on the .22 Caliber (Rifle) belonging to Matthew (murder weapon) One belong to Matthew and the other to his wife, Sally Ann ""Adams"" Dane.

On 7 January 1987, Sally Ann Adams Dane was arrested on open murder charges for the murder of her husband Matthew Lee Dane.  She was given a 100,000 bond, posted shortly afterwards. Continuances would delay the trial. From January 1987  29 Sep 1988. When the 2d grand jury failed to return an indictment. 

**Additional notes of interest:**

SAAD immediately filed claim on Matthew's life insurance policy. **UNBELIEVABLY** The death benefit was paid out on 22 Oct 1986, over $50,000. 6 weeks after a man is murdered,  it's Unsolved, she's the ONLY suspect and the Department of the Air Force paid **her** his life insurance policy?? 

SAAD stated repeatedly that typically Matthew went to the desert for target shooting.  Why would she call Mt Charleston rangers on the morning of 9/8 to see if any accidents had been reported?

**Unfortunately for SAAD, detectives acquired phone records from the Dane apartment in Las Vegas.**  On 7 Sep 1986, a phone call placed at **1:05pm to the Dane family home in Viburnum, MO,**  duration of 14 minutes. Matthew's family would later collaborate they spoke with Matthew at that time. This simple phone call destroys SAAD timeline or statement of events. **They couldn't have been at Mt. Charleston at 11:45 am or 2:30pm due to this simple 14 minute phone call.  Several of Matthew's family verified Matthew called them and verified he definitely attended church at 11:00am at Trinity Temple Church.**

Additionally, on 8 Sep 1986, a phone call was placed to Mt. Charleston Forest Park Ranger emergency line at 6:46am by a white female. Ranger advised woman to call back on business line, which she did at exactly 6:47am.

According to SAAD, Matthew Lee Dane was murdered on 7 Sep 1986, Matthew's parents 23rd wedding anniversary.

SAAD order Matthew's grave Headstone with Date of death: 7 Sep 1986. How would she know when he died? The M.E. couldn't even determine.

this is all in the works and not a for sure thing but for many years I've been fed up with the cost of living in California. I make about 60k a year w/ full benefits with an associates degree in architectural drafting. I commute to work into the city about 50 miles each way and I've been trying to get a place closer but it's been really disheartening seeing 1600 dollar studios and 1800 dollar 1 bedroom apartments if you want something decent. I just find it insane and it's only going to get worse. I never imagine myself owning a home out here. 

I love anything to do with outdoors and I've been wanting to move to Colorado or northern California to live in the mountains and get away. That's kind of been a dream of mine. Then I came across a job near lake tahoe. It's almost a mirror image of my current job but it's obviously in a new location. If I worked in Reno where could I live to be close to lake tahoe and the mountains? Something worth it. 

Some of the activities I have a passion for are hiking, rock climbing and snowboarding. I also enjoy mountain biking, camping and riding motorcycles. 

I have done my research and yes I am used to homeless people, crazy people, high rent and commuting. Ideally I would like to live in a decent area, safe and close to the ski resorts. I am willing to commute. I've seen good options on apartments withing my budget which is unheard of in my current area.

My sister-in-law is finding people from all 50 U.S. states and all over the world and having them write a note and take a photo, then compiling them all into a photo book for her husband as a 30th birthday present. She has taken care of many states already, but we don't know anybody from your state to reach out to. The notes say something along the lines of ""Mark, Courtney's love for you is so big it has reached (location).""

Here are some examples:

So what I am asking of you, r/Nevada, is to create a similar note and take it to a location that is iconic, recognizably from your state, or just somewhere that is special to you. It could be at a National Park or just off your back porch. Feel free to get creative with it.

The caucus was held at an elementary school with like 20 different precincts so I was able to bounce around and catch bits and pieces of all of them. It was fun. 

Now I live in Vegas and will be attending in person. 

What I'm planning on doing is recording the raw vote count at each of the four stages for each candidate. 

Stage 1 - Alignment of physical caucus room participants. 

Stage 2 - Sum of stage 1 + early vote totals.

Stage 3 - Post realignment (the stage at which viability is determined)

Stage 4 - After second choice votes are added to viable candidates

Since I am a caucus participant, I will not be able to move back and forth between rooms, but I will poke my head in the other rooms and hand someone a piece of paper to gather this information and give them a way of contacting my so I can consolidate it for the precincts at my site. 

If enough people do something like this, people can post the results here on caucus day and we can begin to assimilate a picture of what's going on while we wait for official results. 

If anyone wants to chip in, here's the information to gather. 

Precinct#, location and # precinct delegates

Suggested format.

2. Vote count per candidate at each of four stages

a. Physical caucus attendees only. (they group first before the early votes are disclosed) 

b. First alignment totals. (physical attendees PLUS FIRST CHOICE of early voters). 

This is the initial viability determination.

c. After realignment of non viable group participants. (only people in the room can realign, not the early Voters)

This is when final viability is determined.

The ground was muddy as hell, and I nearly stuck my pickup as I was running empty with an empty car trailer. This problem was complicated by the jerk with the pickup and camper parked in the middle of the good access, instead of the parking area.

All good, didn't get stuck, got around the jerk and back terra firma. Walked my happy ass in to soak. Someone has rigged a shitty, low tarp canopy over the spring, presumably because they didn't want to get rained on while soaking. Irritating, I'm here to see the stars and soak, not stay dry and soak. But again, whatever, I'll survive. 

Campfire left going. Empty drink containers left out. Soaking wet rug over the normally damp but perfectly serviceable outdoor carpet by the spring (to keep from tracking mud in). All irritating, but not the end of the world. 

Supplemental hot water line left in. Huge breach of etiquette, as it makes the spring to hot for most to tolerate, you put it in when you want it, you take it out when you're done.

Fine. I'm half dragon. I'll soak hot, I'm already pretty mad at the world at this point. 

Ten minutes in I'm convinced I'm going crazy. I'm smelling chlorine. WTF.

Some selfish, ignorant, unthinking person has put a fucking pool chlorine tablet in the hot spring. 

I give up.

Since most of us have time on our hands, we can mobilize to do something to help out our neighbors, friends, and family. As most of you know, Governor Sislolak closed all non-essential businesses and further closures may be in the future. As a consequence, many Nevadans are out of work or have seriously reduced hours of work. I propose that we mobilize our collective social networks to call our state legislators and the governor.

**The goal**: Governor Sisolak puts an immediate halt to mortgages, rents, and utility payments until Nevadans can go back to work.

To facilitate spreading this campaign, I have gathered the contact information of Nevada Assemblymen, Senators, and the Governor.

Share this link with others who want to support the students struggling with this problem.

Context (From Jessica Avisado):
The University of Nevada Reno is requiring all residents who are living in Canada, Great Basin, Juniper, the Nevada LLC, Manzanita, Peavine, Sierra, and Wolf Pack Tower to move out of their residence halls by March 25th at 5pm. In a recent email, they have stated that, ""residents remain financially responsible for their housing assignments..."" and they cannot give refunds because, ""housing assignments are made based upon a semester or annual contracts; there are no established weekly or monthly options or rates.""

It is unfair and irresponsible for the University to not grant refunds to the students who are being emergency evicted and will not be using school services. Although the University is accepting ""REQUEST TO STAY"" forms for students who must remain in housing, for the health and safety of students it is highly recommended for them to return home, therefore it is greatly irresponsible for UNR to claim they cannot grant refunds based on the fact, ""the residence halls are open,"" as staying in the residence halls will increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19.

If students are being forced to move out of the residence halls they paid for and recommended to practice social distancing, they deserve to at least be pro-rated for the time they actually spent in the dorms, as housing was paid for with the expectation of staying for the full semester. Other universities, such as UNLV, have agreed that, ""students who choose to move home to complete their courses remotely may do so, [and] students will be refunded for the remainder of their room and board."" If other universities can do it, UNR can do it too.

My personal experience with this issue:
I currently live in the Sierra Hall and am being told to move out, not just myself, but all my belongings there too. I am also having to give back my key to my room, even though we are allowed to keep them during breaks. This indicates that the students are not coming back this semester. This is a clear breach in the lease agreement each student resident has with UNR. Yet, the students are still expected to pay for their side of the lease agreement while being essentially evicted with only one week notice. On top of that, the neighboring University, UNLV, is refunding students for remaining room and board.

——————

If you want to show your support, please sign the petition to change what’s happening. To some students, that room and board were really important and the money lost from being kicked out will hurt them financially. Thanks for your help.",Nevada,UNR is Forcing Students to Move Out Without Refunds. Please sign this petition to change that.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

A cashier at the store told me that the suppliers said that it wasn't cost effective to send a truck all the way to Laughlin just to supply one store. After 33 years of business, [Aldape's was forced to close](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/grocery-store-closure-sends-laughlin-residents-to-arizona-1999486/) because it could not restock its inventory.

It was hard on local wage earners after the statewide closure of our schools. Life became even more challenging after the casino resorts closed down. The local casinos were the major employers of this area. The closure of Aldape's has left those members of our community who don't have access to personal transportation without a convenient source of fresh food. The only remaining store that sells food in Laughlin (outside of gas stations) is a Dollar General Store. While the Dollar General carries canned goods, cleaning supplies, and a limited assortment of dairy products and frozen foods, it does not sell fresh meat, poultry, or produce. 

Aldape's will not reopen after the shelter in place order is finally lifted. I suspect that last year's opening of a full sized Smart and Final Supermarket across the river made the grocery business too competitive.  It's ironic that Aldape's might have survived if the vendors hadn't cancelled their shipments. Since this family owned grocery had higher prices than the supermarkets across the state line in Arizona, this also kept the number of shoppers who frequented this store much smaller than those at stores across the river. Given the dangers posed by this unfolding pandemic, I would have been much happier shopping at Aldape's rather than shopping in Arizona. 

While I am not a socialist or even a supporter of Bernie Sanders, I do think that this pandemic has served to further highlight the disparity between those who have and those who don't.",Nevada,Laughlin loses its only grocery store!

52,52,ysnim29,1587027803,g2bffu,Nan,"Hi everyone, I hope you guys are doing well at this time. I am one of the many people who filed a claim for unemployment at this time. I have not tried calling the office yet, as I know it has been hard for them and the lines have been EXTREMELY busy. I was hoping for maybe something to be resolved by now. So I’m writing this post, looking for some guidance. Any information would be appreciated.

I am a full time student at UNLV. I work part time as a receptionist but since the facility got shut down due to COVID19, I do not have a job until further notice. As it is part time, I am aware that the unemployment claim isn’t much. But I am really struggling due to tuition; so anything would help me greatly. The reason why my claim went into pending was because I selected YES to the question “Are you going to school or training”. I picked this because even if I wasn’t going to school physically, I am still learning online due to COVID19 so I thought that it would be a yes. After submitting, I learned that answering yes to this question could mean that I may have a barrier when it comes to applying for a new job. However, even before this, I was attending school two days a week, so it wouldn’t have really been a barrier then. 

I filed my claim on 04/05/20. So it has been 11 days almost. Now I’m wondering how long it is going take to resolve? Will someone call me (considering these unusual circumstances)? Should I wait in the line if I can even get in to call them? Also, to anyone that has had experience with this, do you think this is something that can be resolved? I have heard that claims that are pending usually can be hard to resolve or get unemployment benefits. Thank you so much!",Nevada,Pending Resolution on NEVADA Unemployment website.
