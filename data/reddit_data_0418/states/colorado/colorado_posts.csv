The resort were staying at is Legacy Vacation Resort Suites (it was an awarded trip for buying a ton of inputs on the farm) so with that being said I'm trying to devise a rough plan of attack. We're there for 7 days and I don't want to spend 1000 bucks a person for lift tickets for the week. I'm thinking we ski or 2 or 3 days and go from there. 

A) Best way to purchase lift tickets?
B) Do I need reservations anywhere before I get there?
C) how is the nightlife?
D) Is there a guided snowmobile business that will actually take you to the good snow? Iv been riding in Montana for 20 years so I have experience. 
E) besides the hot springs, is there anything else we should do?

So due to work and personal life circumstances I can no longer give my dog the care and attention she deserves. I have a crazy work schedule that can‚Äôt change and I am moving to a place that is not ideal for her.  

She is a 3 year old Australian cattle mix named Bella. She is super sweet, gentle and loves to cuddle. Very well mannered, won‚Äôt make a mess (unless you leave food human around her) and is house trained. 

I am not giving her up for adoption because of any behavioral issues, or anything she did. I am giving her up to a loving family because she deserves an owner(s) that can be home for her more and give her more attention and the love she deserves and I know she will be happier for it. 
Note, Bella is epileptic and requires 1 pill every 12 hours but I have found that her epilepsy is completely under control at that dosage. 

She is a very beautiful dog and I will send more pictures to anyone interested. I would be more comfortable letting her go to a loving family than have her at an organization such as dumb friends league. If you or anyone you know is looking to adopt a dog that they can love and care for properly. 

My hope with this post is to find Bella a happy and loving home as soon as possible. 

Please let me know. Thank you.",Colorado,Anyone interested in adopting an Australian cattle dog mix?

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

It is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

This restaurant is going to serve thousands of foods over the course of time

A meal is going to be cheap

You will be able to eat thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

681,681,Johnny_Swiftlove,1580650331,exog8h,Nan,"We are a family of 4 (daughters are 12 and 14) and we will be flying in/out of [Denver](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g33388-Denver_Colorado-Vacations.html) from Newark this summer. I have been looking at [flights](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g28927-Colorado-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) and can't find any direct daytime [flights](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g28927-Colorado-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) from EWR / JFK / LGA that go to ABQ which I know would logistically make more sense than r/t Denver tickets. But one of my daughters is a terrible flyer and can't handle layovers or red-eye [flights](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g28927-Colorado-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) so we promised her we would not make her do either again.

We didn't book [flights](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g28927-Colorado-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) yet but have up to 2 weeks for this trip and this is what I am thinking for an itinerary. We are pretty adventurous travelers- have taken our kids on several international trips and do a fair amount of hiking with them (just came home from a trip to AZ where we hiked Camelback and lots of trails in [Sedona](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g31352-Sedona_Arizona-Vacations.html)). 

&amp;#x200B;

**We can't decide which direction we should do our loop around the state.**

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1

Arrive in Denver - we'd take an AM [flight](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g28927-Colorado-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) from east coast so will get in early in the day.  
Do we spend a night here first  to adjust to elevation or drive to [Grand Lake Lodge](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33451-d2216703-Reviews-Grand_Lake_Lodge-Grand_Lake_Grand_County_Colorado.html)? Also considering [Devil's Thumb Ranch](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33666-d142175-Reviews-Devil_s_Thumb_Ranch_Resort_Spa-Tabernash_Grand_County_Colorado.html).

3 nights Grand Lake Lodge -   
hiking - any recs on trails? [Monarch](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g33557-Monarch_Colorado-Vacations.html) Lake hike?

Drive to Aspen - stop at [Glenwood Hot Springs](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33446-d83230-Reviews-Glenwood_Hot_Springs_Resort-Glenwood_Springs_Colorado.html) on the way  
2 nights Aspen - Marroon bells, [Grottos trail](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29141-d270457-Reviews-Grottos_Trail-Aspen_Colorado.html), Hanging Lake (know I need permit)  
[Viceroy Snowmass](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33651-d1546255-Reviews-Viceroy_Snowmass-Snowmass_Village_Colorado.html) or Westin in aspen or airbnb?

Drive to Telluride  
4 nights Telluride - see Ophir Valley, Bridal Veil Falls, [Mountain Village gondola](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33667-d2305408-Reviews-Telluride_Mountain_Village_Gondola-Telluride_Colorado.html)? [Ouray](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g33581-Ouray_Colorado-Vacations.html) hot springs, San Juan Nat Forest ([Blue Lakes Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33667-d102683-Reviews-Blue_Lakes_Trail-Telluride_Colorado.html))  
Not sure where to stay- maybe airbnb or [Peaks Resort](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2004180-d83481-Reviews-Peaks_Resort_Spa-Mountain_Village_Colorado.html)?

Drive to Durango  
2 nights Durango - see [Mesa Verde](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60900-Mesa_Verde_National_Park_Colorado-Vacations.html),   
[Blue Lake Ranch](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33397-d74582-Reviews-Blue_Lake_Ranch-Durango_Colorado.html) or [Purgatory Resort](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33397-d220102-Reviews-Purgatory_Resort-Durango_Colorado.html)?

Drive back to Denver and spend the night  
Fly home from Denver

**OR we can do the reverse**

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2

&amp;#x200B;

Arrive [Denver](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g33388-Denver_Colorado-Vacations.html)

Drive to [Great Sand Dunes National Park](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60841-d9800243-Reviews-Great_Sand_Dunes_National_Park-Mosca_Colorado.html) (1 night)

[Durango](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g33397-Durango_Colorado-Vacations.html) (2 nights)

Drive to Telluride (3  or 4 nights)

Drive to [Aspen](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g29141-Aspen_Colorado-Vacations.html) (3 nights)

Drive to [Grand Lake Lodge](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33451-d2216703-Reviews-Grand_Lake_Lodge-Grand_Lake_Grand_County_Colorado.html) (or Estes Park) (3 nights)

Drive to Denver- fly home on afternoon flight.

**Any insight would be appreciated but most of all we'd like to know about which direction to drive in.  The second option would allow us to NOT spend nights in Denver.  Nothing against Denver, we want to maximize our time in the great outdoors.**  

Thanks for any insight!",Colorado,What do you think of this vacation itinerary?

What can one expect in different parts of Colorado as far as ticks and mosquitos go? Are they super common and all over, or are they less common than other states and not as much of a problem? I know ticks don‚Äôt like to be dry but you do get some rain so idk.

Super glad y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have EEE there, or a huge problem with Lyme Disease, but I‚Äôm still a little unsure - I‚Äôm almost phobic about ticks at this point and last summer there were EEE cases in horses in my county so I went outside as little as possible. We have awful mosquitos here that prefer hanging out during the day even. Thinking of moving to Colorado sometime in the next couple of years and so far from what I‚Äôm reading it seems like paradise as far as all that is concerned.

Hell I don‚Äôt even know if you guys have deciduous trees anywhere out there lol so I‚Äôm pretty clueless as far as wildlife and insects are concerned. About the only two things that have me hesitating on moving are how dry it is (I own a gardening business and I‚Äôm envisioning water rationing like during my Cali vacation one year, which would be a bit of a concern), and whether or not I‚Äôd survive living at altitude üòÑ.

Do you guys get tornadoes or thunderstorms there? Hail? Windstorms? Unique mountain weather? Might seem like stupid questions but I have no idea what the weather‚Äôs like there so I figure hell might as well ask ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Colorado,Ticks and Mosquitos - and what can an outsider expect overall when moving there?

So recently I picked up fishing and I absolutely love it. I love how relaxing it is and it just unwinds me especially after a weeks worth of work. This upcoming summer, I‚Äôm gonna try and challenge myself to go to an Alpine Lake somewhere and hopefully catch me a fish but mostly to escape into the natural beauty of Colorado. Are there any Lakes that anyone would suggest or recommend? I used to go hiking a lot back in high school, but really not much since then. I believe the roughest course I‚Äôve done since would probably be Mt. Falcon. Any suggestion/recommendations would GREATLY be appreciated!

Is Colorado a good state for teachers? What about art teachers? What is the average salary/benefits overall? I know this typically varies from district to district so I am just looking for ballpark estimates overall. 

Is there a certain city/area/district that is better overall? What about for the arts/electives?

I read the rules and assumed this post meets the criteria but I do apologize if not, I just really want to do anything possible to save these guys.

If anyone is looking for an amazing new buddy please consider checking out some of the great dogs available at the Roswell Animal Control in the neighboring state of New Mexico.

These guys are in DIRE needs of rescues/adopters. In the past two weeks, 10 dogs were put down the were HIGHLY adoptable. It's honestly a tragedy- watch the videos of the dogs that didn't make it yesterday and I dare you not to tear-up. These poor dogs don't deserve death.

Despite 6 being killed yesterday, 6 more are already on the chopping block. If you're interested please reach out through Facebook to this rescue group. They are amazing and will help guide you on what you can do to save a Roswell dog's life.

The community can't handle yet another day of sadness, if you can share this with anyone interested in adopting a dog or if you yourself is interested, please go get one of these guys ASAP.

We have a #roswellsurvivor ourselves and he is the BEST boy. He was hours away from death before we rescued him and we're just shocked that no one wanted this guy. He's incredible.

Please help these guys out, you can make today one of shocking happiness if they suddenly get a burst of people adopting and clearing out the shelter!

I was floored to find that Summit County Mountain Retreats refused to refund us, considering the circumstances. VRBO said the same, and defaults to the owner's cancellation policy.

Been to Vail, Aspen, Keystone etc before and not really willing to drive up there for this short period of time and also on a tighter budget this trip. 

Any recommendations of ski areas closer to Denver that are easy to get to and cheaper and have lodging close to the mountain itself? Willing to rent a car to get there and back.

So far looking into Loveland &amp; Echo mountain.

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.
(Especially if you're in Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota and Utah areas).
So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.
Their shows are a blast and so are the dudes in the band.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.
Details of this tour is on their Facebook page.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

[www.govotecolorado.gov](https://www.govotecolorado.gov)

Elections staff are doing all they can to make any voting that has to happen in person safe, but you can help by making sure your voter registration is up-to-date. 

If you aren't yet registered to vote in CO you can also use that link to submit a new registration.

If you think you're registered but the system can't find you, try your previous zip code...maybe your registration is out of date. If that doesn't work, try registering online as a new voter or downloading the [paper registration form](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/vote/VoterRegFormEnglish.pdf) and sending that to your [county elections office](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Resources/CountyElectionOffices.html). They'll get you sorted out.",Colorado,Check your voter registration now to make sure your mail ballot makes it to you in June (and avoid having to vote in person!)
