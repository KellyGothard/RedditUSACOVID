Which tells me he has appeal to the middle and will be electable in key swing areas. And he commands massive African-American support.

I like Pete a lot. He’s the most intelligent candidate in the field. But the elephant in the room is unfortunately unavoidable.

Bloomberg I also like quite a bit. Successful, shrewd executive with bonafide political leadership experience.

Warren and Sanders I’m ok with. But I am seriously doubtful of their nationwide electability.

Everyone else is either kooky fringe (Yang, Steyer, Gabbard, Williamson), in a permanent holding pattern (Booker, Castro), or too obscure to make a serious run at this point (Klobuchar, Bennet, Delaney, Patrick).",1577858070,fcpcc7v

Bernie comes closest but he disgraced himself by taking Michael Bloomberg's money and abandoning his Vermont roots in favor of supporting anti-gun rights policies and other crazypants urban DNC cultural policies, and frankly the economy is too good right now to be voting for people who explicitly promise to burn it all down. I just don't have faith that he, or anyone else, would actually follow through on spending their political capital to expel money from politics over waging culture war. 

There's simple nothing a person from New York or Hawaii or California or Massachusetts has in common with Indiana, and I'm not interested in having them represent me. Pete is from here, but he's had an utterly trivial number of actual people vote for him, he favors crazy big city cultural causes, and he very obviously has a Pence-like need to get recognized on the national stage and leave Indiana behind. 

TBH I really can't stand Trump or any of the Democratic field, and I continue to be disgusted by the quality of candidates our political system produces.

As for falling in line with the DNC, I’d argue that his independent views have shaped the party platform with all other hopefuls now supporting Medicare for all, Green New Deal, livable minimum wage, and having to answer for big donor influence.    He is, after all, trying to win the Democratic nomination, not the independent nomination.

But they took it over and got the address of the vendors, they would have previously went unobstructed by the usps though if the sites weren’t taken down .. like I said I don’t mail them but I did a 1400 page report fairly recently for my final paper with 17 sources mostly scientific journals and white papers on the subject.

359,GoEducateYourself,"I said people from (as in the users), not the admins.  If you did a paper on it, then you should already know about the dogs (yes, they do work in shifts), and the possibility of having your package identified.  So, I'm not even sure why you're going down this road.  Mailing drugs, is a federal offense (in every state, as pot is not ""legal"" in any state, regardless of what the state wants to claim, they just choose to remove the state law against it, and not enforce federal law).  It will certainly go through a scanner, and may be sniffed by the dogs (depending of they are on shift or happen to notice it when that package happens to go through).  That makes it more likely to be caught than driving (where part of the journey you're still in a state that doesnt care), and you can greatly reduce your likely bood of even being pulled over by simply not driving like an asshole.  Thus, you're less likely to get caught by driving it than mailing it (the whole point of this thread, remember?), so mailing it is a bad plan.",1578088466,fcyw9m5

I spent some time around those years checking out some allegedly haunted places and mostly found myself disappointed, disillusioned, doubtful, or in one case disgusted, but Whispers was unsettling somehow. I think most of these claimed-to-be haunted joints have a suggestive atmosphere to them, where you can believe they may be haunted. Whispers had that, but I think the thing that made me uncomfortable at Whispers was we spoke with the owner beforehand for awhile and for what it's worth he came across then as uncomfortable being in the house. I know as someone operating a for-profit ""haunted house"" he had incentives to project discomfort or unease but, nevertheless that was my take.

All that said not a thing supernatural was noted while I was in the house, and we were there, I don't know, for a good six hours I'd say.

Personally, i'd be interested on where he stands on Marijuana legalization given Illinois and Michigan having legalized for recreational as well as the recent stance by Marion county to not prosecute possession under an ounce. He's very well connected within the state politically and has been linked to the gubernatorial race in the past. 

Hill also has a TON of money to campaign with which is partly what won him the election last time. Hill is VERY well connected in Washington and has a lot of elected GOP officials that support him and that will likely support him in his bid for re-election. 

The kid from Fishers, Westercamp, is a joke. He's been practicing for 5 years and none of it as a prosecutor. He's nowhere near a viable candidate for the top law enforcement official in the state.

back then, Governor Mitch Daniels said [""At what point should government stop collecting money from a free people?""](https://www.wthr.com/article/daniels-proposes-tax-refund
) and they decided that 10% was the magic number.  

He also said [this](https://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2011_State_Mitch_Daniels.htm) when pushing to get the law passed:

&gt;I ask you to vote for lasting spending discipline by enacting an automatic taxpayer refund. When the day comes again when state reserves exceed 10% of annual needs, it will be time to stop collecting taxes and leave them with the people they belong to. Remember what the Hoosier philosopher said: ""It's tainted money. 'Taint yours, and 'taint mine."" Beyond some point, it is far better to leave dollars in the pockets of those who earned them than to let them burn a hole in the pockets of government.

Then our economy got mega-fucked, and we cut back on spending. In particular we cut back on education funding.  Cut back so much that in 2012 we hit that 10% threshold and we got $111 back when we did our taxes.  It's 2020 now and education funding has still not recovered from the cuts a decade ago.

Then in 2014 our lawmakers changed the law to make it harder to reach that threshold.  I guess they didn't actually want to give our money back to us? I'm not sure where that 15% figure came from, but I'm tired of trying to find the law, it's harder than I thought to find it all.",1578420044,fdhcquv

634,ZgylthZ,"Because investing in people IS Socialism. It is using the collective wealth of individuals in a society and spreading that wealth among SOCIETY, hence the name. It is a system ran by and for SOCIETY. In a purely socialist society the masses control industries (say, the energy industry) through nationalization.

Capitalism is a society ran by and for CAPITAL - read: resources. Those who already own capital of one sort have only one metric to determine success - capital: how much capital do I currently own and can I continue to get more of it. In a purely capitalist society all industries and aspects of life are privatized - all aspects of society are treated as a form of capital, a commodity to be bought or sold.

“Investing in people” through tax breaks, debt forgiveness, and social programs like healthcare, housing, or SNAP, is a form of SOCIALISM. You can fund these using capitalist economy but the programs themselves are SOCIALIST programs because they take collective wealth and spread it to all of society.

Human-centered Capitalism is still capitalist - it’s still a system ran for and by CAPITAL, not HUMANS. When Capitalism has its occasional downturn every half decade or so, those with the least capital lose it and those with the most buy it up, leading to a constant growth in inequality. There is also a common misconception that capitalism = markets, which isn’t true. Socialist economies have markets too.

The difference of socialist vs capitalist economies boils down to control of production (worker owned/nationalized vs privately owned). You can’t have human-centered capitalism because privately owned businesses will look after those private owners - just individuals. Those private owners will do what benefits THEM the most, not their workers or their customers - they only worry about those if they cut into the bottom line. 

In publicly owned (read socialist or nationalized or worker coop) industries, everyone (or at least the workers themselves) own the business. The business will then do what benefits THE PEOPLE the most - the bottom line isn’t “make me and my shareholder friends money” anymore, but “what benefits ALL of us the most?”

Hope that makes sense. At work so kinda had to start and stop a lot

An enterprise only qualifies as “socialist” once the distinction between employers and employees within it has been abolished.

The fact that the state regulates private capitalist enterprises and operates state capitalist enterprises does not reduce the capitalist structure of an economy. So long as employers, private or state, hire laborers to produce commodities and generate profits that the employers exclusivelyreceive, the economy has a capitalist structure. So long as it is exclusively the employers (whether private, state or hybrid; whether more or less regulated) who decide how to use those profits, it is a capitalist structure.

&gt;An enterprise only qualifies as “socialist” once the distinction between employers and employees within it has been abolished. When workers collectively and democratically produce, receive and distribute the profits their labor generates, the enterprise becomes socialist. 

&gt;Such enterprises can then become the base of a socialist economy – its micro-level foundation – supporting whatever ownership system (public and/or private) and distribution system (planning and/or market) constitute that economy’s macro level.

**TL;DR: Capitalism = privatized. Socialism = Worker Owned. All privatized industries will have a bottom line of benefitting the OWNER class because that’s who runs them.

It is detrimental to entrepreneurship. it also does not address the biggest economic problem we are going through, which is job loss due to automation. a problem that is only going to get worse. what do you tell a retail worker in her mid 40s when she loses her job? dont worry we have contruction projects for you to work on? or learn to program?

714,Notsurewhattopicktbh,"Yes I’m familiar with that excuse they give out every single time the issue comes up. It’s complete BS. Not trying to sound argumentative towards what you learned but it’s simply a BS blanket excuse they repeat.

There are hundreds statewide, tens of thousands nationwide, of tiny local - city and county departments that DO have body cams. How can they afford it and not the State Police?  There is around only 1,300 State Police in the entire State and not all of them are even Troopers. They’ve got plenty of money for the (undisclosed number) Stingray devices they use without warrant and the software and expertise for them.  Also they have plenty of money to afford the high performance unmarked race cars to hide and chase people down in to collect revenue. Did you know in many other countries all police cars are all highly marked and visible so if somebody needs help (protection or service) they can easily flag down an officer? 
It’s not the cost. They just simply don’t want transparency or to be held accountable.
Much like the incident in Montgomery County where Glenn Rightsell was shot in the face and murdered by State Trooper Daniel Organ, who did not have a bodycam or dash cam. Yet minutes after the shooting, 4 to 5 random local Crawfordsville/ Montgomery officers responding as backup did have cameras. This footage is now all that exists of the incident which is now evidence in the lawsuit his widow just filed, which she will most likely win. How many millions has and will this cost the state? I’m sure that same money could’ve supplied quite a few officers with cams and software and data storage. The Trooper that shot him was investigated by the State Police themselves, no wrong doing found, and never missed a paycheck only to be reassigned to another county. ( Putnam county motorists beware)

As far as this so called data storage issue, expertise, and cost, what about each officer gets his own private YouTube channel? Or something similar to upload relevant video after each shift? A 7 year old kid has the expertise to do that.
There are many solutions to this alleged issue and cost, and as mentioned countless little departments all over seem to be able to figure it out and afford it.

And for the record, I’m by no means anti cop or a cop hater. I’m just saying, and calling it for what it all is. Complete BS. I’m sure there’s many good officers who would like to wear a bodycam for their own safety, not just the citizens should an incident arise involving dispute or tragedy. Many departments across the nation utilizing body cam footage for training purposes not only for recruits but ongoing for veteran officers and state it’s some of the best real life training tools to utilize.

You see a need, and this is definitely a need, but you disregard legitimate obstacles as ""BS,"" which is pretty common when people are as frustrated as you clearly are. I tend more towards logic than emotion, which makes it easier to see where barriers are. It also makes me come across as a bit of a bastard, but if it's the price for clarity, I'll pay. I'm going to start by breaking down the information you gave me which was actually to my point. 

If there are around 1300 troopers, working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks peer year, that works out to about 2,704,000 hours of footage annually. Then there would be the footage from the dashcams. [Footage would be required to be kept for 280 days by the State Police.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/) However, in the event of footage being involved in a complaint against the ISP, or of a person requesting the footage be retained for longer, it is kept, automatically, for no less than 2 years. These data would have to be constantly uploaded, organized, maintained, and deleted.

Storing this on YouTube is unrealistic, because it is an official government record. Having each officer be responsible for curating and archiving their own footage is utterly irresponsible. I'm not saying they don't have the skills to do it, I'm saying that it would be incredibly easy to abuse a system set up like that. 


As for your comment that other places have these measures in place: this is absolutely true, and totally irrelevant. For reasons too complicated to get into here, state political cultures can vary wildly. These differences can manifest in policies, budget, taxes, education, healthcare, and more.

Because we are discussing State Police, here, any meaningful comparison could only be made to other state police departments. This is due to size and funding source. This is not an area that I've done much research into, so I can't really name any that would make a useful example. What I can tell you is that a good comparison agency would be similar in size (number of employees). From there you'd look at the state budget, as well as tax revenue and tax code. Then you'd need to see the agency's budget. All of this boring money stuff would give you a pretty decent idea of the ways that the states' differences, and agencies' differences. 

For the record, you have a brilliant grasp on the benefits of having body cameras on police, and I agree with your reasoning 100%. I believe it should be funded, but I also know that it won't be cheap, and red states hate taxes.",1578481044,fdjolhk

738,Miathemouse,"First, I would like to point out that you're coming at me like I'm arguing against you, but I actually agree. Second, not being an expert in data management doesn't mean I don't understand it. I have to understand how data management works because I analyze data, it's simply a different kind of data. I analyze structured data, which is just spreadsheets. It's a lot easier than working with unstructured data (pictures, audio files, video, text that it a sentence or more, etc.). Structured data takes up a lot less space than video. I don't actually need to know exactly how much less to understand that it is a fact. This is the same as not needing to understand how the DOT works to understand that a minivan is smaller than a semi trailer.

Now for the fun part: making comparison between groups (be they people or organizations) is what I've trained to do. I simply use a different type of data to do so. Allow me to explain what I see when I'm looking for a comparable agency: 

* With smaller departments comes a smaller price tag and significantly fewer political hurdles to implementation than a state-wide agency would have.
* Municipalities can implement taxes and create their own laws regarding the storage of data, so they could be quite different from those of the state overall, or a wealthy municipality could vote for a new tax specifically to cover the cost.
* The differences between state and local laws could disrupt any financial comparison.
* A company that can easily handle the data of one department may not be large enough to handle that if the entire state. This, again, disrupts the comparison of cost.
* Elected officials at a municipal level tend to be more in touch with their constituencies than those who govern at the state level.
* State level officials have to make compromises and concessions to deal with competing funding interests from different areas of the government or different regions of the state.
* Once money has been allocated to the budget of the State Police, there are further concessions and compromises when the funding gets dispersed.
* Lobbying exists at the state level in a way that it does not at the municipal level, and it affects political outcomes.
* Self-dealing and nepotism can affect contracts, which, again, can affect costs, and thus, the entire comparison.

I was already aware that these programs exist. Without a comparable agency to look at, there is no way to assess your claim that it is an excuse. The reason that it has to be a state police department of similar is because it would have similar costs and hurdles to implementation. Additionally, it could help to strengthen the argument for implementing this in Indiana.

Given the short session, the four leaders acknowledged they likely won’t “solve” any complicated issues, including teacher pay questions. But they vowed to continue having important conversations.

“We look forward to a short session, where we’re going to not fix all this – I can assure you it’s much too complex to do that – but really begin to move the state forward,” Bray said.

With the start of the 2020 legislative session about a month away, party leaders are formulating their plans for the short session, with teacher pay continuing to be a point of contention.

Republican leaders House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tempore Rod Bray, along with House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta and Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, discussed their upcoming policy goals on Wednesday at the annual Bingham Greenebaum Doll Legislative Conference. Though the short session won’t allow as much time to debate the issues – Bosma predicted the Legislature would adjourn by March 11 – the leaders envision the General Assembly tackling multiple high-profile issues, including health care costs, standardized testing, raising the smoking/vaping age and marijuana decriminalization.

Also likely to feature prominently this year is a continuation of the debate over teacher pay and other school funding issues. Republicans have touted the 2019-2020 biennial budget that they say invests a record amount in K-12 funding, but [scores of Hoosier teachers](https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/thousands-of-teachers-gather-for-indiana-statehouse-protest) descended on the Statehouse last month to advocate for more dollars and other education reforms.

All four leaders agreed that Hoosier teachers remain underpaid compared to other states, but the party-line split about how to resolve that issue was evident during Wednesday’s discussion.

On January 7th:

[Indiana’s governor opened the door Monday](https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/indiana-governor-changes-stance-on-teacher-pay-action) to potentially boosting school funding and teacher pay after weeks of refuting any plans on such action until next year.

Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb didn’t give any details of what he would propose during his annual State of the State speech next week, while a top legislative Democrat promised his party would push for more school funding in the wake of a November rally that drew several thousand teachers to the Statehouse.

Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders have since repeatedly defended the 2.5% per-year increase included in the two-year state budget approved last spring and maintained that further steps regarding the state’s lagging teacher pay would need to wait until the next state budget is written in 2021.

Holcomb has said he would wait for recommendations later this year from a teacher pay commission he appointed in February but told reporters Monday that might change with state tax revenues growing faster than expected.

“Stay tuned, you’ll hear more from me at the State of the State address,” Holcomb said.",1578586495,fdnigyw

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blitz


Project Blitz, founded by Randy Forbes[1] is a coalition of Christian right groups, including the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (CPCF) (also founded by Forbes),[1] the National Legal Foundation, and Wallbuilders Pro-Family Legislators Conference.[2] It seeks to ""protect the free exercise of traditional Judeo-Christian religious values and beliefs in the public square, and to reclaim and properly define the narrative which supports such beliefs."" The group specifically encourages lawmakers to enact legislation that eliminates paths for legal interference of Christian practice in the public square;[3] supports conservative legislators at the local, state and federal level with public relations and messaging;[3] and otherwise seeks to alter longstanding narratives of religious liberty issues.[3] Its agenda includes the promotion of the Bible in public schools and religious exemptions to LGBTQ civil rights protections and women's reproductive healthcare.[1]

The Project's steering committee includes David Barton;[4] Buddy Pilgrim, founder of Integrity Leadership; Bill Dallas, founder of United in Purpose; and Lea Carawan, co-founder and executive director of the CPCF.[5][3]


---

The Project is best known for providing model legislation, proclamations, and talking points for state and local legislators who wish to introduce bills that support religious freedom and liberty, as defined by the Project. Through its Report and Analysis on Religious Freedom Measures Impacting Prayer and Faith in America, the project provides models and strategies for addressing a variety of its concerns, including definitions of gender and sexuality, biblical literacy in public schools, recognition of Christian heritage and Christmas Day, and displays of the national motto. It also provides talking points for opposing efforts that restrict conservative practices, including the prohibition of conversion therapy, and repeals of State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts.[6] A previous version of the report was distributed to over 750 state legislators.[7]

Let's recap: 

Iran attempts to burn down the US embassy and kills a US contractor in a rocket attack. 

US retaliates by killing a career terrorist who was meeting with the Iranian militia who perpetrated the attack on the embassy. The same career terrorist that supplied weapons to kill American soldiers, and helped his government kill 1,500 unarmed protesters last month.

Iran fires rockets that don't kill or injure anyone, 56 Iranians get trampled to death at a mandatory attendance state funeral, and then 180 innocent people are blown out of the sky over Tehran. 

Now exposed to the world as careless murderers, Iran quietly shelves any further direct retaliation, and Trump kindly allows them to continue existing, after allowing the left wing media to disgrace themselves by defending Iran and freaking out over a fake impending war.

To anyone who exists outside the Democratic party's media bubble,  this is a clear win for Trump and the US as a whole. We got justice for our soldiers and staff in Iraq, Iran lost their chief terrorist, and Iran lost the world's respect by killing innocents and their own people. The Democrats and the media are today palpably disappointed that the war they so badly wanted ended up not happening, and have once again been exposed as partisan hacks.

So the efficiency gap is worthless but eyeballing is a great way to tell if something is gerrymandered? Compactness seems like a terrible point. It's the 3rd largest city in the country and generally districts are made to be somewhat equal populations. Greater Chicago in Illinois alone is 9 Million people, that's 70% of the state's population. You'd be better off arguing that the state it self should be split up. As far as Contiguous-ness, I've already spoken to one of the worst districts from that perspective. Illinois' 4th.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_snapping_turtle


&gt;Though not verified, a 183 kg (403 lb) alligator snapping turtle was found in Kansas in 1937,[12] but the largest verifiable one is debatable. One weighed at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago was a 16-year resident giant alligator snapper weighing 113 kg (249 lb), sent to the Tennessee Aquarium as part of a breeding loan in 1999, where it subsequently died. Another weighing 107 kg (236 lb) was housed at the Brookfield Zoo in suburban Chicago. Another large turtle reportedly weighed 135 kg (298 lb).[13] They generally do not grow quite that large. Breeding maturity is attained around 8 kg (18 lb), when the length is around 33 cm (13 in), but then they continue to grow throughout life.[14] Excluding exceptionally large specimens, adult alligator snapping turtles generally range in carapace length from 35 to 80.8 cm (13.8 to 31.8 in) and weigh from 8.4 to 80 kg (19 to 176 lb).[12][15][16][17] Males are typically larger than females.[18] 88 adult alligator snapping turtles averaged 21.05 kg (46.4 lb), 92 averaged 19.72 kg (43.5 lb), and 249 averaged 13.5 kg (30 lb). Usually very old males comprise the specimens that weigh in excess of 45 kg (99 lb) per most population studies.[16][17][19] Among extant freshwater turtles, only the little-known giant softshell turtles of the genera Chitra, Rafetus, and Pelochelys, native to Asia, reach comparable sizes.

Get rid of the pensions, provide an average 401(k) style retirement benefit, and tell the folks it is on them to save when they are making $60-$70K+/year in the last ten or so years of their employment.  The state doesn't have to worry about going broke from pensions (which deficits will rise if pay is raised and pensions remain the same, because pension payout is tied to wages) and jobs that more and more require a $40K-$80K+ higher ed investment will actually pay a decent wage during the later part of the career.",1578750638,fdvrd61

I've seen what is happening to some of the vinyl neighborhoods built in the metro area.  Many of these homes were built very cheap and are likely going to need constant costly upkeep as the decades past.

In any of our urban areas, especially the larger ones, I doubt there is a three bedroom home that is in decent shape for $100K.  If you have examples, I'd love to see them.  My 60s 1,350 sq. ft. ranch home only went for $125K a few years back.  I had to fork over $9,000 for much needed crawl space and attic issues, so really I only walked away with $116K.  And I had put in about $17K in updates/repairs as well in the 11+ years we lived there.  The purchasers put in I don't know how much, but they made a lot of interior changes to modernize it and sold it for around $160K about a year or so ago.",1578752095,fdvvpbg

Anderson is in similar shape.  There are actually some OK pockets with solid, decent homes that would sell for $300K+ if they were in Carmel.

I'm always associating those comments with housing the poster(s) would actually want to live in.

Also, I don't consider it in ""decent shape.""  Looks nice, but just the few photos offered (wonder why that is?) there is a basketball court area that needs repaired, the garage isn't finished, and the wood stove needs a serious update.  Plus if the kitchen was updated along with all those other things, the price for sale now plus all those updates/repairs would likely push the price over $100K (likely not worth the investment given it is a rental property).

Still, there is nothing comparable to the American West or Southwest.  Prices in West coast states are way too high.  If you can handle lower Midwest winters, you might consider looking into Salt Lake City or Albuquerque.  Both appear to be cheaper than Denver.  Las Vegas is better for a more mild climate, but that is a tourist city in transition to other industries as people flee the coastal states for more reasonable housing but want to be as close as possible.  In the east, Knoxville is pretty nice as well, but housing prices there have went up a lot more than I'd ever expect in just the last say five years.  I think they are getting some spill over from Nashville's growth.

Since the actual sentence would likely be shorter than that and the number of Hoosiers actually impacted by this legislation would be small, it doesn't seem to me like there would be any ""mass incarceration"".

You know your point is indefensible when you have to resort to ludicrous hypotheticals like this. 

By the definition in *Miller*, the weapons accused of being ""assault weapons"" are the most explicitly protected by the 2nd Amendment, not the least, as combat rifles are the most relevant to the preservation and efficacy of the disorganized militia (which is everyone).

Scalia specifically articulated an individual right to keep and bear arms, and prohibited the banning of weapons in common use. ""Not unlimited"" has been wrongly torn from his opinion and wielded like an out-of-context club to justify all forms of infringement, including those specifically struck down in *Heller*.

SCOTUS is not the last word on constitutionality, the people are. We have eyes. We can read. We can understand words. We know what infringement is. 

&gt;Also note that if you break the law, you are no longer ""law-abiding"".

1248,JasonPattieGroup,"I'm aware that the prevailing school of thought when choosing between mail couriers for distributing drugs is to go with the USPS because ""they need a warrant to open your package"". I've read this many times in posts such as this one. However, if that's the only reason in support of the argument then I think it should be challenged and that the question of which mail courier to go with when mailing illegal items deserves some more thought and analysis.

So, the USPS needs a warrant to open a package and private companies like UPS, FedEx and DHL don't, right? Let's grant that entire statement as being 100% accurate for the sake of this thought experiment. I have a few questions in response to that fact:

* What motivation do private companies like UPS, FedEx and DHL have for catching their customers mailing drugs with their service? What are their costs and benefits of catching those people? 
* What systems, technologies, resources and organizations do UPS, FedEx and DHL use regularly to intercept these parcels? 
* On the other hand, what systems, technologies, resources and organizations does the USPS employ to find parcels transporting illicit substances? The USPS has their own law enforcement arm which include [The United States Postal Inspection Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspection_Service) (USPIS) and The United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General. Their mandate is to conduct ""Prohibited Mail Investigations"" which are defined as ""Prohibited mailing investigations are USPIS investigations that focus on the prohibited mailing of contraband including: narcotics, precursors and proceeds; child pornography and other sexually prohibited materials..."". Additionally, both of these organizations routinely employ the help of agencies such as the FBI, Homeland Security, The Secret Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among others. 
* Given that the USPS has it's own law enforcement arm and is supported by pretty much every major United States law enforcement agency and The Department of Justice, how hard is it for them to get a warrant if they want one? I don't know the answer to that question but I know that insignificant local cops can (and do) manufacture their own probable cause in order to get a warrant all the time...so how hard could it be for a huge organization like the USPS, or their law enforcement partners, to get a warrant if they have a suspicion about someone or something?
* Pull up a list of the arrests of people sending drugs via a mail courier within the U.S. over the last few years and count the number of arrests where the illegal items were sent via USPS and the number of arrests where the items were sent through any other mail courier. Almost all of them were sent through the USPS and the arrests and/or investigations were conducted by The United States Postal Inspection Service, The United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General, or one of their cousins (i.e. DEA, FBI, ICE, Homeland Security, etc.). Note: I can't list the source because it's an onion site but I'm sure you can find a list on the clearnet. 

I guess what I'm asking is...are any of the private mail couriers even looking? Because I know for sure that the USPS is. And it doesn't seem too difficult for them to get a warrant. So, if the only argument for going with USPS to send your contraband is that ""they need a warrant"" to do that then I'd ask, ""OK, so...what's your point?"" Then they get a warrant.""

On the other hand, the private couriers don't need a warrant to go through your stuff but I don't know that they have any incentive to do so. 

Finally, I'm not saying that I know for sure which courier is better. Many of the questions I asked above were genuine questions and were in no way rhetorical. I don't have all the answers. But it just seems like the USPS has significant incentives in place to look for, and find, contraband sent through their mail routes and they have all the resources and man power needed to catch many of the people mailing and/or receiving those illicit items. 

And it doesn't seem to me like the private mail couriers have much interest in conducting any investigative or law enforcement activities and I don't see many arrests where the items were sent through those couriers. 

I'd love to hear from others about what I just said. I've never been one to accept the status quo at face value and always do my own thinking before I've come to a conclusion. However, my own analysis isn't perfect either so, if I was wrong about anything please don't hesitate to let me know!",1578783445,fdytpa5

1287,indygreyt,"Even though this user obviously doesn’t really care, I’ll share for those who might actually be interested.

Research has shown that these programs do reduce the recidivism rate. Many offenders come from situations where they’ve always only looked out for themselves. They commit selfish crimes that hurt others because they don’t understand that others matter, too. By giving them another life to care about, it allows them to learn the value of compassion. And when they eventually have to give up the dog/cat because it gets adopted or they phase of the program, it teaches them about sacrifice and giving back to others. After offenders are released, they are less likely to offend because they understand all of these values.

These are really great programs for both the pets and the people, and I would encourage everyone to do their own research into them. Similarly, there are animal programs that work with nursing homes, crime victims, hospitals, and other groups - whatever your passion is, there’s a way to get involved and give back instead of just posting strawman arguments on the internet.",1578797338,fdzware

1346,prtyon5thAv,"“In God We Trust” is not a definitive statement on the establishment of a national religion. Your claim is infantile and reflect a common misunderstanding of the establishment clause. Just because a public institution, in this case state public schools, make gestures towards a religion does not represent a violation of the Establishment Clause, per se. The Establishment Clause pertains only to the establishment of a national religion. Therefore, it should only be invoked if there is some sort of compulsory and exclusionary religious practice on a national level.  As a point of fact, it was not uncommon or prohibited at the Founding for state to have established state religions. I’m not advocating for that, I only bring it up to illustrate that this is not violative of the Establishment Clause. For this to move into the territory of Establishment Clause violations it would have to resemble something like every student being forced into a definitive faith tradition without their consent, or in reality their parents’ consent, and the prohibition of any other faith traditions in the public square. That is not the case, and claims to the contrary are frivolous. 

I’m glad you attempt to seem fair minded by giving the qualification that there is nothing wrong with religion in schools, however you follow that almost immediately with the proclamation that it must be private prayer, as if any sort of public display of religion necessarily means that (a) it is a definitive statement of that religions truthfulness and (b) that is is oppressive of all other faith traditions. 

You say that 
&gt;it is unconstitutional for the school, or it's staff, to teach any religion as being correct.

But this is not true. First, if it were true, this would represent a violation of the staff’s personal free exercise of religion which they have as citizens of the US. Second, it is plainly constitutional for localities to practice religion as they see fit. It is not the norm for school to be greatly diverse and multicultural, especially in Indiana. We are generally talking about homogeneous, small, local communities who generally share backgrounds. At that level, a prohibition on religion in public school classroom is an injustice against those people and how they want their children to be brought up. Here, I think we can generally agree. Children should be educated how their parents see fit. A broad brush prohibition of religion from classroom violates that ethic, and just as we would probably stand together against compulsory education say of a Muslim in a Christian faith tradition we should stand together and say a group of Christians should be able to have their children taught their faith in their schools. This principle shouldn’t be applied only to Christians, though. It can and should be applied to all faith traditions. Local Jewish, Muslim, Hindi, Sikh, etc. communities should be able to educate their children as they see fit. Allowing them access to public money seems just to me, and forcing them into a Faustian Bargaining between having their children educated as they see fit and access to public funding for their schools seems unjust to me. 

As for your last claim: 
 &gt;Not teaching anything about religion, is not the same as teaching that religion is false.

I disagree. How can we, as a society, legitimately hold that position? How can we say we want the best education for our children and want them to learned about the world and everything in it, while at the same time barring any sort of religion in public schools on the spurious and misguided grounds that it represents an Established State Religion.

should Satanism be taught in public schools? 

Should atheism be taught in public schools?

If no to either, why not?

&gt;...this would represent a violation of the staff’s personal free exercise of religion ...

How so? How is not teaching religion as fact, the same thing as not practicing your religion?

&gt;Children should be educated how their parents see fit.

If there is one person in the community with a child that does not share the same beliefs about religion, then teaching religion in a public school violates this value.

&gt;...compulsory education say of a Muslim in a Christian faith tradition...   a group of Christians should be able to have their children taught their faith in their schools.

These are two separate issues. On is teaching someone's children something the parents think is false. The other is not teaching someone's children something the parents think is true. The former undermines the parents will, the latter does not.

Let's say you know for a fact that your entire community is 100% the same faith as you, so you teach that faith in your public schools. What happens when someone's child, from a family not of your faith, starts school? Do you suddenly have to stop teaching your faith so you don't undermine the will of the new child's parents?

Unless you make it legal to prevent any non-Christians from moving into your town, then your idea isn't workable.

&gt; How can we, as a society, legitimately hold that position?

Because it's fact. Not teaching someone something, is not the same at teaching them that it's false. If I didn't teach a child that we landed on the moon. That's not the same as teaching a child that we didn't land on the moon. In the former, if someone does teach that child that we landed on the moon, I would not be contradicting them, in the latter I would be contradicting them. Do you see the difference? 

&gt;How can we say we want the best education for our children and want them to learned about the world and everything in it, while at the same time barring any sort of religion in public schools on the spurious and misguided grounds that it represents an Established State Religion. 

I'm an atheist and I think religion is false. I do not want my children to be taught false things. I'm not asking that schools teach that religion is false.

&gt;...you’re oblivious if you don’t think that is a tacit and implied affirmation of atheism when that is the case. 

Ok, you teach your children that God exists and Christianity is the truth. Then the school has nothing to say on this issue one way or the other. How is this the affirmation of atheism on the schools part?

&gt;If you don’t want your children to take part in religious activities **in a [public] school**, so be it.

I added the word, public, as that clarifies my true intention.

&gt;...to deprive other children of those religious activities because of your own personal objections is oppressive and wrong.

How is having public schools not supporting a specific religion of your choice, the same things as not allowing you to expose your children to what ever religious activities you wish?

Just to share a similar occurrence in my hometown:

In Madison, the entire downtown is a National Historic Landmark (largest in the US), littered with official Indiana Landmark buildings. We were once one of Indiana's biggest cities before the railroad, and were being considered the new capitol with Indy, plenty of historic significance here. We have our own preservation board and they are more strict than the IN and US standards. If any modification is done that is publicly visible, you have to get approval from the board (last month my mom had to get approval to remove a trellis above her side door that was put up by the previous owners). There's a loophole where the only time you can build new is if the building can't be salvaged. So, what ends up happening is we get these owners who just let buildings sit and deteriorate until it's beyond repair, which can take years and years. Some of them have been Indiana Landmark buildings. The residents are furious about this for historical reasons, but also economic reasons. If the Madisonians couldn't get funding with their tenacious vigor, I foresee it being a real challenge. Best of luck in your endeavor.",1578938481,fe9jz83

I think it is important that they make up their own minds on the subject. When asked, I tell them that it's what some people believe. 

Teaching a child that a religion is true, is teaching them something. Teaching a child that all religions (and supernatural beliefs) are false, is teaching them something. Teaching a child how to come to their own conclusions, is teaching them something, but that something has nothing to do with religion.

1482,prtyon5thAv,"&gt; In short, my problem with you was, you kept telling me what you though I thought. And you were wrong.

I’m not telling you I think you think. I started by refuting your claim that religion in public schools was a violation of the Establishment Clause. From there, you started making claims about the veracity of religion and why it should be barred from schools on those grounds. I understand you think you’re presenting a unified and coherent argument, but you’re not. You’re jumping around and conflating different arguments I’ve made against different postures of yours. I’ve made an effort here to reply directly to positions you’ve taken explicitly.

When you say:
&gt; You keep insisting that my agenda is to teach atheism or being anti-religion.

I don’t know what grounds you stand on here. 

First, it is a mischaracterization if my argument against your position to say I believe you want to teach atheism in public schools. I’ve made no argument reflecting that position so I’ve no idea where you got that idea. What I have very clearly said is that the removal of all religion for religion’s sake from public schools is not a fair, unbalanced, and equal playing field, so to speak. That couches every potential argument about anything not of purely materialistic nature in a manner that defaults to atheism. Everything defaults to a sterile, mechanical, and materialistic view of the world. 

Second, you are very clearly anti-religion. Explicitly, your entire argument is against religion in public schools. “Anti-religion” literally means against religion or opposed to religion. In this scenario, that is literally your position. Implicitly, statements like: 
&gt; Let schools teach things that are empirically supported.

in reference to excluding religions from public schools demonstrates a lack of knowledge on the definition of the word “empirically”, a departure from your principled stance that religion in schools was a violation of the Establishment Clause, and, lastly, a bit of personal anti-religious sentiment. 

&gt; The only way for public schools to not establish one religion as true over all others, would be to teach all religions and atheism. Frankly, there wouldn't be enough time in the day to teach ever religion on earth.

This is nonsense. 

First, you once again misunderstand the Establishment Clause, so, even if your statement were true, your argument doesn’t prohibit religion in schools. Once again, there would have to be exclusionary action towards other religions and compulsory actions towards individuals for there to be an establishment of religion. Let’s say for instance that one school district has religion in the classroom because the parents of that district want it and that religion is some Christian denomination. The district right next to it could do the exact same thing but be Muslim because the majority of students are Muslims. That violates nothing, whatsoever. If parents don’t want their children to be taught or to participate they reserve the right to exempt their children, as they do for other things like Sex Ed. The idea that religion in the classroom per se violates the Establishment Clause does nothing but reflect an ignorance of the meaning of the Establishment Clause. 

Second, just because an idea is presented in class doesn’t mean that idea is automatically infallible and must be accepted without scrutiny. When you say “establish one religion as true over all others” it really boggles my mind a bit because it suggests a sort of system where children are automatons that just believe whatever they are told and should accept it regardless of their own ideas, which I don’t think you believe but that is the logical conclusion of the argument you presented here. 

Third, you keep exempting atheism from being a religion when it shouldn’t be. Atheism is inherently a statement of faith and its adherents live their lives in a way that is in concert with its principles. To say otherwise would be like being asked to pick between A and B and your choice being to be neutral and then saying you don’t have a position. That posture would be illogical. You don’t have a position inside two of the categories but by the nature of deciding to remain neutral you have a position. If you then went back and tried to proclaim a position in a new argument regarding A and B and desired to be treated disinterested that would be wrong. To illustrate this analogy, imagine you’re in a room with 2 other people, 1 Christian and 1 Muslim, and they ask you what religion you are and you say you aren’t (you’re neutral). Then, the conversation shifts to religion in schools and you then present your view. It would be flawed reasoning to claim your position should be viewed as disinterested in the conversation. That is the situation regarding prayer in schools. It is unjust to then push out Christianity and Islam and others on the grounds they’re religious and then act as if you’re left with disinterested “irreligious” actors. 

Finally, to say it is necessary to teach everything about every religion is absurdity. That would be like saying if we want to include math in schools we would have to teach every single mathematical concept ever known or to teach American literature we’d have to assign every American book ever written. 

&gt; Let schools teach things that are empirically supported. And let's keep schools out of teaching things that can not be empirically supported.

Like I said earlier, I don’t think you know what empirically means. This statement is equivalent to saying we shouldn’t teach philosophy or literature because they can’t be empirically supported.

&gt; Schools teach language, math, science, history, etc... and leave it at that. I know, religion is part of history. But you can teach the historical existence of religion without teaching religion.

I abhor a public education system this diluted and droll. Also, no you can’t teach the historical existence of religion without teaching that religion. Can you imagine trying to teach about 9/11 without covering the religious origins of the terrorists motivations? It’d be incomplete and wrong and not even worth teaching. Also, if not taught with enough attention to the religion or no other context of Islam you’d end up with an equally bad outcome of students believing terrorism is a necessary part of Islam. 

Look, I think you’re deeply misguided on your view of religion and have created a strawman of it. I understand if you come to the conclusion honestly that you don’t believe any religion is worthy of belief, I’ve been there. I don’t take this position out of a burning desire to evangelize for my specific religion. I take it because I know Americans have a skewed view of religion, almost  regardless of their personal belief, and it is only through the study and contemplation of religion that people can truly say they know where they stand. You said you believed it was best for your children to come to their own conclusions. I believe that is admirable, however the sincerity of that belief could be questioned given a desire to prohibit religion from being presented in a theatre in which society holds as being the center of learning.

Presumably the person who granted Indiana Landmarks a covenant or easement did it as part of a deal where he got the foreclosed property for cheap (for practically nothing, I hear, but I don't know that).  And presumably the understanding was that he would put his money into it and bring it to ""first-class"" condition, per the covenant.  Instead, he tried to sell it for $50,000.

Now there used to be a scam where people would buy historic houses on credit and strip them of everything saleable, such as the light fixtures, mantelpieces, even door and window casings, and then default on the loan.  Antiques prices have deteriorated so much recently that I don't think this is still profitable.  I don't know if this house has been stripped.

1572,prtyon5thAv,"&gt; If you teach X, you are teaching X. If you do not teach X, you are not teaching ""Not X"". To put it anther way, if I say X is true, then clearly I'm saying X is true. If I say nothing at all about X, that is not the same as saying X is false. I really can't see how you think that not talking at all about X is the same as saying X is false.

This is an incomplete assessment of the situation at hand. Here you have stripped all context from then issue and act as if the debate comes ex nihilo. In the context of schools being viewed by society as the institutions where learning is paramount the exclusion of religion sends the message that religion is not worth being learned. Further, in the historical context of the debate, the positive action of removing religion from schools only redoubles that message and strengthens the connotation in society that religion should not be take seriously by people concerned with serious things, which is wrong. 

&gt; You either think the state can establish a religion or not. If public schools are teaching one religion, then the state is clearly establishing a religion. Public schools not mentioning anything about religion, is not the same as teaching that atheism is true.

I don’t know how many times we have to cover this. That is not what the Establishment Clause means, and it’s patently absurd to suggest otherwise. 

First, states can establish certain things in their government more favorable to certain religions if they see fit without violating the EC. Just because part of the government makes overtures to religion does not violate the EC. Once again, the EC is only violated if citizens are prohibited from practicing their religion and forced to observe one instituted by the government. If Vermont tomorrow was overrun by satanists in the government and they instituted prayers to Satan and put up monuments of him, it wouldn’t violate the EC. They would have to bar Christians, Muslims, etc. from their practice or force them to participate in their rituals for that to be the case. 

Second, this: “If public schools are teaching one religion, then the state is clearly establishing a religion”, is wrong; for reasons stated above and others. It also isn’t how most policies would be implemented. Public schools aren’t a monolith. They can and would be varied by the populations that attend them and their curricula would reflect their constituents desires. It’s not even likely that schools would be uniform within school districts. The more flexibility the better. If IPS has constituents that desire Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and secular schools, there should be nothing stopping them from providing schools that meet all those needs and students would naturally flow where their parents desire them to learn. This also gives lie to the notion of there being an established religion by allowing *any* religion in school. What religion would be established in that case? 

Lastly, public schools not saying anything about religion defaults to atheism. The education provided literally becomes devoid of God or without God. To say otherwise reflects a misunderstanding of words. 

&gt; You can't teach that X,Y, and Z religions exist without insisting that one of them is true? You can't teach that different people believe in various religions with out teaching that one of them is the, true, religion?

This is a non-sequitur, first, and, second, a strawman that clearly mischaracterizes my position. The point I made was meant to illustrate that you can’t understand the actions people have taken on religious throughout history without giving credence to the religion and teaching a great deal about the relevant doctrines. For example, you can’t teach the Reformation, for example, without first teaching the practices or doctrines of RCC that Luther opposed. However, to do so would require inviting a debate that has animated religious conflicts for centuries now. That has nothing to do with truth claims, as you suggest, and, here I go back to something I said earlier, you seem to believe that the mere invocation of religion in schools is necessarily authoritative and oppressive. While that is silliness, it also reflects an indoctrinatory view of education. You have proclaimed a desire to allow your children to experience the world as they will and draw their own conclusions while at the same time promulgating this view of schools that suggest students will accept what they are told uncritically. Those two things are inconsistent unless you believe your children to be unique in question the world and believe yourself to be unique in desiring for inquisitive children. 

&gt; To me, it seems you are saying that not teaching that one religion is the true religion, is the same thing as teaching that atheism is true. I can remember being young and knowing about the existence of many different religions and not even realizing that being no religion was a thing. Parents teach their children religion and the state should stay out of it entirely.

This seems to encapsulate the whole interaction so far. You still take the claim that barring religion is a neutral position. It is not. Especially in schools. 

For someone who baselessly complained about me putting words in your mouth, you sure seem to be okay with continually mischaracterizing my position despite my repeated explanations of where you are mistaken. This: 
&gt; “it seems you are saying that not teaching that one religion is the true religion, is the same thing as teaching that atheism is true.”
is not my position. If you wish to know my position perhaps you should scroll up because I’ve explained it at length and in detail multiple times by this point.

You show as much here: 
&gt; Parents teach their children religion and the state should stay out of it entirely.

&gt; You keep disingenuously changing the subject from public schools officially teaching a specific religion as part of there curriculum, to ""allowing religion in schools.""

What are you talking about? The subject never has been about uniformly teaching one specific religion in schools. This whole thing sprung from a religious statement being on walls. That’s not teaching one religion in schools. I haven’t changed the subject at all. I’ve maintained that schools should have control at the local level to control their curriculum and include religion if they so wish. Also, this doesn’t have any relevance to the passage you quoted. 

&gt; I have no problem with anyone practicing their religion while in a school. I do however take issue with the state deciding which religion they are going to officially teach as being the true religion.

This is a blatant lie. You said over and over again you don’t want any religion in schools and that it should only be addressed in passing and should be relegated to private individual practice. It’s also a strawman. For the millionth time at this point, just because religion is in school doesn’t mean that it’s the state position that that religion is the one true religion. It’s annoying that you keep insisting on this standard that isn’t realistic at all and that no one is arguing for. 

&gt; You simply seem to want muddy the waters with this lie about religious persecution so you can use the state to force your religion to be taught to other peoples children.

What?!? What waters are being muddied? Where have I said anything about religious persecution? Where have I said anything about teaching other people my religion? This is laughable.

You should also take note that your proposed scenario is a red herring.

I don’t understand your obsession with creating entirely unrealistic scenarios is. You assume the majority will be the only religion taught. You assume that there will necessarily be religion in every school. You assume that kids will be sent to school solely based on their religious backgrounds. You assume so many things that are in no way requisite and then present them as the definitive consequences and then turn around and have the hubris to make a statement like this: 
&gt; Can't you see how this is completely unworkable?

As if you have prophesied the only potential outcome of religion in schools is failure in complete disregard of the fact that this is how most schools operated for most of our history and there are many schools in Indiana already that are faith based that educate kids of different faiths.

1639,prtyon5thAv,"&gt; Another dodge.

This isn’t a dodge. You’re asking me to make a blanket decision for vast swaths of people based on numerous assumptions that have no grounding in anything whatsoever. Just because you present scenarios like this:

&gt; Let me ask again. Should a parent be forced to send their child to a school hours away, if all the closer public schools all teach a religion they do not believe in? Or do you think the family should just, change jobs, and move, to be closer to a school that is not teaching a religion they don't believe in?

doesn’t make them realistic or representative in any way. Plus, I’ve said numerous times at this point nobody can be forced to do anything they don’t wish to. Idk what you obsession is with dominating other people. You act as if saying people should be free to do as they wish in their local community is vague or ambiguous. It’s really not. Maybe your desire to control other people is inhibiting your ability to see that.

&gt; Really? Seriously? You don't think that allowing public schools to teach religion wont end up an any scenario like this happening anywhere in the country? You're the one being unrealistic.

It’s absolutely unrealistic to say that every person of differing faith traditions will immediately become disadvantaged by religion in schools and must necessarily upend their lives to adjust. If parents value religious education in their faith traditions they will make the necessary preparations for that desire. Once again, you have a keen ability and seemingly endless desire to throw strawmen out at will. It’s quite sad and undercuts your argument if you have to argue down against a gross caricature of my position.",1579183153,fejqc51

1646,clown-fuck69,"No, for several reasons.

A.  Indiana wouldn't benefit from legalizing recreational marijuana, because of the privatized prison systems that are part of our infrastructure in Indiana. Indiana is one of the 14 States that houses these private institutions owned by the federal government. they have a contract in which they must keep 90% up to 100% population in these prisons in order to not be fine via the taxpayers if they do not meet the required population of these prisons. therefore if marijuana was legal in Indiana you the numbers would drop drastically, and almost guarantee we would drop below these contracted population requirements. Then as a result the taxpayers of Indiana would have to pay a fine in the form of ""low crime rate tax"".

B.  Big pharma, such as Eli Lilly can not directly patent a chemical isolated from a plant. Meaning they could not profit from using THC for example as a pharmaceutical drug because they could not hold a patent on it. if they can't profit from it, they have absolutely zero interest as pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly that are only worried about one thing, PROFIT!

  Unfortunately, amongst other things they don't care about is the safety or efficacy of the drugs that they produce, and then sell to the public. as long as the substance in question is approved by the FDA for pharmaceutical use as a medication. sadly it does not matter if they can help hundreds of thousands if not millions and millions of people buy manufacturing and selling the drug when they don't hold the patent and other pharmaceutical companies can follow suit...that is why they have no interest in legalizing or working with this compound or any other compounds found in Cannabis sativa where is a pharmaceutical, greed.  It is a sad but all too true fact.",1579189658,fejzz4y

1649,clown-fuck69,"Unfortunately this is true, except for one small but very very unlikely event, Federal legalization.

Federal legalization of marijuana use recreationally would Trump state law, therefore making Indian no longer have a choice but too legalize cannabis, and follow federal guidelines as such.

Will it ever happen, probably not. But you are right the only way that you can potentially utilize the beneficial effects of cannabis use weather recreationally, or more importantly medically is to move to a state that doesn't rely on privatized prison systems and greed, and recognizes that not only does cannabis not lead to any harder drugs, but has unlimited potential for medical use. but the federal government still hasn't recognized that and keeps it schedule one under the controlled substance act meaning it has no current medical value.

1672,Bohammad,"I got an Associate's in Information Technology from Ivy Tech Fort Wayne about a decade ago, and I'm not sure where the transfer information came from, but I'd definitely ask more about that. Back then, every single one of my credits would transfer to IPFW (PFW now). Also ask about applications to other state colleges, because having an associate's from Ivy Tech could automatically get me in to a bachelor's program at IPFW within 3 years. 

As far as the classes go, I couldn't recommend Ivy Tech more. The majority of the folks in the Server and Cisco courses were there for continuing ed and recertification, who had been in the industry for as long as I'd been alive, and were able to provide real-world scenarios and applications that aren't in the text books. 

They offered core English and Math courses at 3 different locations that were closer to me than Fort Wayne, through WorkOne and the high school. Those folks were also local to me, so it made networking good too. I took night classes, so almost all the folks were working adults and you got to see who was hiring and for what locally.

If cost is a big factor in your education, just get it. You'll have an entire degree for the cost of 2 semesters at a major university. Not only are you going to have better luck finding a job with a 2-year degree vs nothing, but if you want to move to a bachelor's, you'll have much better luck at any admissions office vs someone fresh out of high school.

South of Fort Wayne there is a abandoned hotel couldn't find the name (there's no sign unfortunately) very sketchy been there myself very ominous place I've heard quite a few firsthand tales about Demons people have seen in that place but like I said it's sketchy full of squatters/drug dealers likely a meth lab in there, and all the windows are broken out so glass is everywhere inside. Personally it was nightmare inducing..

1742,Jelfff,"Over the last couple of weeks I have produced a series of **non-partisan interactive map links that can display political districts**.  This project is a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"". 

One map shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, including **Indiana**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

Otherwise, with a more reasonable cost-of-living plus good entry level jobs, this city is one to get some experience and leave, depending on career path.

1953,CitizenMillennial,"I agree that nothing will really change in a meaningful way until the consumer can afford it. However, cleaner energy is already cheaper. The companies are transitioning on their own (well market forces) and Indiana is trying to force them not to. The amount we subsidize in coal is huge. Those subsidies could go to newer forms of energy. At least a larger percentage. We pay those subsidies. I understand some areas may not be able to transition as quick as others and maybe they should get a small portion to help them out until they can switch however the big companies are raking in money. Every other business has to use their profits for upgrades to stay relevant. They should too. 

There was recently a big article about Duke energy asking the state permission to  hike rates.[The highest rate hike requested by an energy company in decades.](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-duke-energy-rate-case) They said they needed to do this to pay for the upgrades needed to use cleaner energy,  update the grid to make it more efficient &amp; because of the costs associated with population growth. (Which is ridiculous, more energy used = more people to put money in their pocket) However, they got huge pushback because they have already added extra \*fees\* that were claimed to be for exactly that purpose years ago. Since adding that fee, their profits have gone up and they have not upgraded yet. 

From the article: Utilities in Indiana and across the country — driven as much by market forces as environmental stewardship or federal mandate — are shifting away from coal and toward natural gas and renewable energy sources, a movethat by one state utility's account could save customers billions of dollars in coming decades.

1956,CitizenMillennial,"From the article:

If coal plants are not able to be retired and if they have to be maintained — as another part of the bill suggests — then those costs will be passed down to customers.

“The idea that we are trying to, as a state, to undo a utility like NIPSCO’s current business plan, which is based on economics and least costs of service to customers is just absurd if not downright unethical,” Olson said.

A common thread to Indiana's coal legislation this year and last is [Soliday, a state lawmaker who](http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2020/legislators/legislator_edmond_soliday_864/) helps lead a task force meant to set a course for Indiana's future energy policy. Soliday authored the current bill, which was referred to a panel he chairs: the House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee. He also proposed [unsuccessful legislation last year](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2019/04/05/coal-indiana-could-real-winner-new-amendment/3329898002/) that would have required state regulators to put a 20-month moratorium on large electricity generation projects. He did not respond to IndyStar's multiple requests for comment.

He (Scott Pruitt, former head of the EPA) registered with the Indiana Lobby Registration Commission as a self-employed lobbyist working on the topics of energy and natural resources. And as he did last year, Pruitt told the commission he was working on behalf of Railpoint Solutions LLC, a company with ties to Terre Haute-based [Sunrise Coal](http://sunrisecoal.com/about/).

The manager of Railpoint listed on [Pruitt’s registrationform](https://secure.in.gov/apps/ilrc/lobbyist/public/filing/view/compensated-registration/RLCEIX) — Heather Tryon — is also the [chief financial officer for Sunrise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-tryon-30406b96/). Railpoint, registered in Delaware, and Sunrise are both subsidiaries of Colorado-based Hallador Energy Co. 

Hallador, according to a [transcript from a recent earnings call](http://www.halladorenergy.com/Cache/1001254352.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1001254352&amp;iid=4187964), said that ""we've recently seen the State of Indiana which represents 72% of our sales, further embrace and defend coal.""",1579623449,ff6bbrf

1977,MhojoRisin,"For what it's worth, [a blog post](https://www.masson.us/blog/hb-1031-reducing-public-ownership-of-lake-michigan-shoreline-slightly-expanding-public-uses/) on the subject:

Rep. Miller has introduced [HB 1031](http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2020/bills/house/1031#digest-heading)  which would have the effect of reducing public ownership of the Lake  Michigan shoreline. I believe this legislation is in response to the  2018 Indiana Supreme Court case of [Gunderson v. State](https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/02141801mm.pdf). The Court stated:

&gt;A century ago, our Court of Appeals recognized that,  among those rights acquired upon admission to the Union, the State owns  and holds “in trust” the lands under navigable waters within its  borders, “including the shores or space between ordinary high and low  water marks, for the benefit of the people of the state.”  
 . . .  
 \[W\]e hold that the boundary separating public trust land from  privately-owned riparian land along the shores of Lake Michigan is the  common-law ordinary high water mark and that, **absent an authorized legislative conveyance**, the State retains exclusive title up to that boundary.

The Court described the basic controversy as being “whether the State  holds exclusive title to the exposed shore of Lake Michigan up to the  \[ordinary high water mark\], or whether the Gundersons, as riparian  property owners, hold title to the water’s edge, thus excluding public  use of the beach. The landowners argued that the boundary was wherever  the water met the land at a given moment while the State argued that it  was further landward, including the exposed shore. Ultimately, the  Supreme Court sided with the State that it holds land in public trust to  include the exposed shores as the water periodically recedes. The fact  that there is a beach demonstrates that the water covers the area more  than occasionally.

. . . 

HB 1031 seems to relinquish some of the land that the Court declared  was held in public trust: It states that the boundary of “private  property is determined according to the legal description of the private  property in the most recent deed to the property that is recorded in  the county recorder’s office” and “to the extent that this section  recognizes the existence of private property extending closer to Lake  Michigan than the natural ordinary high water mark of Lake Michigan, the  state of Indiana relinquishes its ownership of the shore of Lake  Michigan.”

However, with respect to the land the public retains, the legislation  says that the public can do more than just walk on it. They can also  jog or run or engage in other activities in which the participant  occupies a space on the beach only temporarily. However, the permitted  activities specifically do not include “lying on the beach, playing  volleyball, picnicking, or other non-transient activities.”",1579644365,ff7a5ar

There was a perfectly good incentive to do so because any excess energy from your solar panels was sent back into the grid and you were paid the going rate for it.

He's only been in office for one year.  There's no evidence that he has gained ANY power or notoriety.  He doesn't DO anything.  He holds ""office hours"" for 2 hours in the middle of the workday in small towns, good luck trying to get your voice heard there.  

He sits on five committees which you have never heard of because they are not the powerful committees.

look at this https://i.imgur.com/MBx14lo.png  does that look like he's gained a large amount of power?  He's at the bottom of the chart that measures ""Leadership score""  seems like the opposite of what you are claiming",1579718818,ff9qlt7

2043,thomsomc,"&gt;May I suggest to the OP that he re-examine his partisanship and consider whether having a President removed on this issue is desirable and necessary.

Fair question, but I'm pretty confident.  I think there are likely tens, perhaps hundreds, of really good rational reasons to remove Trump from office, but this one is supported by a ton of evidence, is constitutionally and legally valid, and seems to have caught on with the public, so I'm on board.  I'm not jazzed at the idea of President Pence, and I'm not excited about how angry conservative voters will be about it, but I genuinely think his exit will allow Republican lawmakers to return to sanity and start the process of healing that will be required to get over the mess he's made.

Due to increased partisanship on both ends, I'm not likely to support a Republican candidate any time soon.  But to give you an idea of where I personally stand, I'd vote for the ghost of John McCain for president over many of the current Democratic candidates. 

&gt;Donald Trump should never have been nominated (or even considered) for President, but we need an Executive who is independent of the state of party representation in the Legislative branch.

Model legislation	

&gt;The Project is best known for providing model legislation, proclamations, and talking points for state and local legislators who wish to introduce bills that support religious freedom and liberty, as defined by the Project. Through its Report and Analysis on Religious Freedom Measures Impacting Prayer and Faith in America, the project provides models and strategies for addressing a variety of its concerns, including definitions of gender and sexuality, biblical literacy in public schools, recognition of Christian heritage and Christmas Day, and displays of the national motto. It also provides talking points for opposing efforts that restrict conservative practices, including the prohibition of conversion therapy, and repeals of State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts.[6] A previous version of the report was distributed to over 750 state legislators.[7]

---

&gt;As of December 2018, 25 bills based on the recommendations of the Project were introduced out of over 70 being considered. They passed in five states, including Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, and Tennessee.[2] These sorts of bills included measures that would, for example, allow adoption and foster care agencies to refuse services based on religious beliefs and mandate[8] public schools to display ""In God We Trust"" signage.[5] ""Also popular were bills encouraging schools to teach the Bible and encouraging students and teachers to express religious beliefs in school – both of which can lead to proselytism or denigration of non-Christian faiths.""[7] Legislation drafted by Project Blitz to allow Bible classes in public schools was enacted in Kentucky in 2017, and at least ten state legislatures introduced versions of the same Project Blitz bill in 2019.[9]

&gt;As of October 2019, CPCF leadership had claimed a network of 950 state legislators in 38 states.[1]

Project Blitz, founded by Randy Forbes is a coalition of Christian right groups, including the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (CPCF) (also founded by Forbes), the National Legal Foundation, and Wallbuilders Pro-Family Legislators Conference. It seeks to ""protect the free exercise of traditional Judeo-Christian religious values and beliefs in the public square, and to reclaim and properly define the narrative which supports such beliefs."" The group specifically encourages lawmakers to enact legislation that eliminates paths for legal interference of Christian practice in the public square; supports conservative legislators at the local, state and federal level with public relations and messaging; and otherwise seeks to alter longstanding narratives of religious liberty issues.

There is, however, the line that ""they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights"". I could forgive someone for thinking that alludes to God. That'd be an honest mistake and certainly something that a follower of Christianity would likely believe is talking about God. 

But there is a lot of scholarly work on why God isnt specifically in the Constitution, especially given the well known and documented religious beliefs and past of the people germane to its creation and signing. 

If you're actually interested Id [start here] (https://allthingsliberty.com/2016/02/why-god-is-in-the-declaration-but-not-the-constitution/) for a cursory look at the subject. It is quite interesting.

1.) It may be. It may not be. It depends on a lot of factors and each case, even when appearing similar, has a lot of minutiae that can sway the outcome either direction.

2.) Separation of Church and State is another thing that doesnt appear in our Constitution (much like God, as we addressed earlier) but is a topic in which we know a great deal about how the founders viewed it. Thomas Jefferson himself used the phrase. And there is 200 years of jurisprudence that proves the concept does exist. You can argue *accommodationism* (and there is likewise jurisprudence supporting that postion as well)  but that alone does not invalidate the separation of chruch and state. Only that there is an ongoing debate of its depth and meaning in society. But the idea goes back to our founding. To say there is no such thing is patently and demonstrably false.

For example, Tippecanoe County voted to raise the county income tax by 0.2 percentage points, ostensibly to spend on more police and better facilities for the police throughout the county.  This means at 4.68% total state and county income tax, our income taxes are now higher than Illinois' (where counties don't get to charge income tax), and we're closing in on Massachusetts' 5.05%...and Massachusetts charges less in sales tax (6.25%)!  (Both states have wildly varying property tax rates ranging from $0.80 to $3.00+ per $100 and good luck trying to figure out the tax rate in Illinois.)

Short answer: go ask an accountant

Long answer: There are several factors that come into play when you look at this question and there’s actually a lot of significant variations that could make getting a HELOC worth it, not worth it or it might not matter.

Things like: other properties you may own, businesses you have any type of ownership of and even seemingly unrelated things like investments you have and they allocations they’re in all could POTENTIALLY change the answer to this question.
I’d recommend asking an accountant about this. If you go to your bank you might find they’ll push you towards the HELOC since they get paid on selling them and a major selling point of HELOCs is the mortgage exemption for people without a primary mortgage.",1579800973,ffcjt0l

2231,Ophidianlux,"Thats absolutely fair.

Maybe I’m misunderstanding the question but a property tax exemption is a tax exemption you qualify for when an outside party has a lien on your property and you pay interest to that company. 

In a standard mortgage you’re paying the mortgage which satisfies this criteria. When you no longer have a mortgage a HELOC can satisfy this requirement as well. 

Quick note: usually the interest you can deduct is locked to the originally purchase price of the house. So if you bought a house for $50,000 and then get a Heloc and take out $75,000 you would only be able to claim interest paid on 50k of the balance.

There isn't even actual corruption happening. There's no quid pro quo. At the most generous to the Democrats, there was a vague and clumsy attempt to push for suspicious activity to be investigated, which was almost immediately reversed and abandoned. 

Furthermore, the primary source of all these claims has already been reported to have been conspiring to build an impeachment justification since before Trump even took office.

The City doesn't board up second-story windows -- too dangerous and, I suppose, not accessible to the homeless.  They do have three infractions they notified the owner about and will be processing next month.  It's curious that the ""owner"", according to them, is somebody in Fishers, Indiana.

Paul Diebold, the Assistant Director of Preservations Services for the State of Indiana, replied:

""I spoke with Jessie Russett just now, and she tells me that Indiana Landmarks is seeking the owners, to get them to comply with health and safety codes. Additionally, they may pursue more legal measures against the owners, who are out-of-state.   


""I did double-check on our ability to pursue anything regarding this property. There would have to be a firm tie-in to a state or Federally-funded project for our office to have any legal footing in the matter. ""

So he's not going to do anything, either.  Another Preservation Service that doesn't do preservation.

The local Indiana Landmarks person said they would cover the hole in the wall.  Apparently what they meant was they would go through their procedure and maybe get the owner to fix it in six months or a year or never.

But they are sponsoring a conference in South Bend on April 14th - 17th!  Early tickets only $100!  $225 late!  Come and listen to talk about historic preservation, because that's what Indiana Landmarks is about -- talk, that is.  Not actual preservation.

And you can see the ice sculptures this week in Richmond!  You can stand in the cold rain and snow and listen to local live bands!  Now I wouldn't be advertising the uncomfortable Winter climate here, but then I'm not the one getting paid for making ice scuptures.  I'm just one of the many paying for them with my taxes.

“On January 25, Senator Robert Byrd moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Representative Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56–44, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin.”
....
“Over three days, February 1–3, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70–30 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6”

“On January 25, Senator Robert Byrd moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Representative Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56–44, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin.” .... “Over three days, February 1–3, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70–30 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6”

Just in case you missed that: House Manager Bryant moved to call witnesses, the senate voted to depose witnesses via videotape, and then reviewed that testimony. All of this occurred DURING the senate trial. Not allowing the prosecution to call relevant witnesses and evidence IS a sign of guilt and is the behavior of an autocrat, not a republican.",1579959082,ffhya99

You act like my eyes are closed and you deny the validity of proven fact evidence verified by multiple witnesses.  You watch this thing like a sporting event and you *think* the red team can do no wrong.  You're wrong.

Think for a second: if Trump's lawyers are fighting the good, noble fight, then why have they not disputed the fact evidence once?  Why are they talking about disproven conspiracy theories like the CrowdStrike server bullshit?  On Monday, they are going to talk about the Bidens all day.  Why?  Because they cannot disprove the evidence.

They literally stated the Constitution was unconstitutional this morning.

If the ""blue team"" didn't exist, this would still be impeachable and worthy of conviction.  You are supporting a criminal in Donald Trump.  He's actually the criminal he falsely claimed Hillary and Obama to be and weren't.

What about when the President obstructs justice and prevents anyone close to him from testifying? Because that’s what you’re willfully ignoring. 

&gt; This whole thing is so fucking stupid and sets such a bad precedent. 

Let’s not pretend like there has ever been anything like the case that Trump presents. Getting a BJ and lying about it is nowhere close to the foundational threat posed by asking a foreign government to provide dirt on a political opponent, or inviting a different foreign government to interfere in our elections, or blatantly using the presidency to fill one’s own pockets.

&gt; House builds the case, Senates does a trial. 

It’s more akin to the House is the grand jury and decides whether to indict (impeach). The Senate does do the trial, which, in any normal situation, would involve witnesses, an impartial jury that hadn’t made up its mind ahead of time, and a judge that actually enforces the rules.

I emailed him and told him of my desire for him to vote to remove Trump.

I got this--

&gt;Dear [Punchee],

&gt;          Thank you for contacting me regarding President Trump. I appreciate hearing from you.

&gt;         On September 9, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee was notified of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint relied on secondhand reports from unnamed sources to allege President Trump had improperly used the office of President to solicit cooperation from the Ukrainian President to investigate allegations of meddling in the 2016 election by Ukrainian officials and corrupt behavior from previous U.S. officials in Ukraine. The House Committee demanded immediate declassification of sensitive documents to investigate the claims. Before either the whistleblower’s report or the transcript of the conversation had been released, Speaker Pelosi announced she supported the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry in the House.

&gt;          In the days following the announcement of the inquiry, the President, in the interest of full transparency, took unprecedented action by ordering the declassifying and public release of both the transcript of the phone call between the President and Zelensky and the anonymous whistleblower report.

&gt;          Now having read both the whistleblower report and the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I believe that the impeachment proceedings can only be characterized as a politicized attack on the Trump Administration. The documents reveal a conversation in which President Trump talked to President Zelensky about alleged corruption that occurred in Ukraine beginning under the Obama Administration and continuing through the 2016 election, topical and highly relevant to the United States’ recent relationship with Ukraine.

&gt;          Career politicians, distressed by President Trump’s election in 2016, have sought from the day after the election to undermine his ability to effect change. Instead of working on issues that the American people care about, like healthcare reform, infrastructure, or ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Democrats have instead decided to continue harassing the Trump Administration with flimsy and unsubstantiated claims.

&gt;          **I was elected by the people of Indiana to support President Trump in his efforts to change business as usual in Washington, D.C. That is what I intend to continue to do as your United States Senator.**

&gt;         It is an honor to serve as your U.S. Senator from Indiana.  Please keep in touch with me on issues of concern to you. You can also follow me on Twitter or Facebook for real-time updates on my activities in the U.S. Senate.  If I ever may be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.

&gt;Sincerely,

As for the jail thing that has been a hot topic in the sub lately... There are four(ish) traditional goals in criminal punishment: retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, and incapacitation.  Retribution is the sense of justice for the victim, their family, and society as a whole. Obviously the victim and family won't get much from his incarceration. Society? Who knows.  
Rehabilitation to make a criminal a better person. It's hard to imagine there's anything he needs to learn that isn't now crystal clear.  
Incapacitation is about locking away a dangerous person to keep society safe from a person like a murderer who continues to be dangerous, and it doesn't quite work to incarcerate dangerously dumb people.  
Then deterrence. The idea that if a criminal is punished publicly, it will convince others to never commit that crime.

Now flip it to the mental health world. This doesn't mean you can just turn away suicidal people because they're gay... What it *does* mean is if they were uncomfortable prescribing something or performing a specific procedure/evaluation they could be exempt.

An examples of this would be prescribing hormone therapy for a gender dysphoria patient. If they do not want to do something like that because of their personal beliefs, they would refer the patient to someone else.

&gt;Laws that ban particular breeds of dogs do not achieve these aims and instead create the illusion, but not the reality, of enhanced public safety.

In a a statement issued in 2013, President Obama said “[w]e don’t support breed-specific legislation—research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources. And the simple fact is that dogs of any breed can become dangerous when they’re intentionally or unintentionally raised to be aggressive.”

Dog bite statistics are [notoriously flawed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24299544) and breed is not a statistically significant factor. Breed misidentification occurs in 30-40% of cases, largely due to pressure to confirm preexisting bias by reporting the breed as ""pitbull"" even when that designation does not apply.

2823,oarion7,"I can about near guarantee you I am as far outside the Democratic party's media bubble as you are, and no, not everyone outside it sees this the same way you do. I am not a Trump-hater, like others I am simply disappointed -- a far contrast from how I felt that beautiful ""morning after"" in 2016. Totally shocked and taken aback by the women sobbing at my place of work that day, I shared with them what an America First foreign policy would look like, and the vision Trump was actually promising the people who bothered to listen to a single campaign speech. For a short time I brought a lot of people around me together in hope.

I certainly will not shred whatever glimmer of hope remains, but the fact remains that the foreign policy of the Trump Administration -- regardless of whoever you think is in control of it (if anyone; and this ""point"" of confusion may remain our thread of post-partisan common ground) -- does not serve America's interests, continues to sanction and bully Russia and bring us closer to nuclear war, is single-handed orchestrating the illegal and grossly unjust detention and torture Julian Assange through its proxy government in Great Britain, and continues to train, aid, and arm Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria.

Hillary Rodham Clinton had been campaigning to call the Iranian military a terrorist organization for decades, and her will is finally done on the matter. I would be the absolute last person on the planet to tell you the world or this country would be better off if she were President. But with the look of things, it remains an understatement to say that I am quite insufficiently convinced to contrary.

All this is to say, yes, the Democrats turned this into something it wasn't, and I think Trump and Iran may have been putting on a show themselves. But this is not the Presidency we were promised. The greatest of blame is the failure of our culture to encourage any follow through from our leaders to push them to keep their promises. 

For what it's worse, Tulsi needs ballot signatures BY TOMORROW to get on the ballot in Indiana. I suggest people do what they can and quickly. She is now the only candidate embracing an America First foreign policy. Even if you want very badly to give Trump the chance to prove me wrong, and I am begging God to make him do it, getting Tulsi's movement going may be the only way to force Trump to follow through and end the Bush/Obama doctrine once and for all.

He is very relevant because the entire case the House Managers were making was based on the premise that there were zero hints of corruption involving Hunter, Barisma, or Ukraine. 

On the other hand, I could see how republicans would want to skip new witnesses and just vote to acquit mainly because we all know that unless something incredibly new, huge, and damning comes out, the senate will vote to acquit no matter what. There is no evidence that there’s anything necessarily new to reveal. So much of the senate sees it as a big waste of time, which is the Democrats goal, they know it’ll acquit in the senate so they’re now just trying to make Trump look as bad as they can.

In a trial, it is the responsibility of the prosecution to assemble a case worthy of a conviction (assuming such a case exists). The House had such a raging hard-on to impeach Trump because the evidence has been so “overwhelming”, they rapidly wrote and voted on Articles based on the irrefutable case. Turns out, there is no constitutional basis to remove a sitting President as anyone with a modicum of sense can understand after listening to both opening arguments. 

IF the Managers think their is new evidence then by all means convene the Judiciary and subpoena the witnesses (Bolton). This will lead to a legal battle over executive privilege. Every President should have the right to protect certain people with executive privilege. Just think of this example; Secretary of State takes the stand where he can be asked anything and a line of questioning begins regarding top secret negotiations, cia operations, embassy security protocols, etc. He can not lie about what he actually knows as he is under oath but also can’t reveal top secret information as that is illegal as well. So enter exec privilege.

The Dems would never ask a member of the administration to divulge state secrets in an open, televised session. That’s a ludicrous assumption. 

And the evidence that Trump intended to interfere with our elections IS overwhelming. He has admitted to his actions outright and even called for China to help him out. His Chief of Staff admitted to it as well. Both on national TV even. There is no question to his guilt. The partisan argument now is over process and semantics, the objective being to get Trump acquitted over technicalities instead of actually seeing the evidence and hearing witnesses. 

Since the FBI, InterPol, the Ukrainian government or even the CIA haven’t come forward with legitimate dirt on either Biden we are left to believe that they are innocent of these charges because not one atom of evidence has been put forward to warrant such an investigation. Rudy (the fixer) was sent to make such evidence magically appear because no actual law enforcement agency (anywhere) says that there is any. Same with Ukrainian possession of the vaunted Clinton Email server. Do you believe that they are all are hiding this info out of fear from a 3rd place has-been from Delaware, or do they fear losing their relationship with their most powerful ally against Russia, an invading superpower? 

The real question is: are we willing to allow our public servants to lie and cheat for their own benefit as long as they are on our political side?

The Indiana Beach ballroom also hosted hundreds of other performances, including legendary big bands who drew massive crowds in the 1940s. Records from most of those performances at the Lake Shafer amusement park in the 1940s and early 1950s are sketchy at best.

Specifies the duty of Indiana officials to enforce the law. Specifies that federal officials attempting to enforce contrary court orders against Indiana officials enforcing the law shall be subject to arrest by Indiana law enforcement.** Redefines ""human being"" for purposes of the criminal code to conform to the finding that human physical life begins when a human ovum is fertilized by a human sperm.

Representative Jack Jordan (R-Bremen) says there are nearly 1,600 sections of Indiana law setting rules for schools to follow. The House has unanimously approved his bill to let schools apply for waivers from anything that doesn't involve safety, collective bargaining, budget or test scores. 

Jordan says the goal is to get rid of anything that gets in the way of the central mission of educating students. If there's a stack of waiver requests for a specific rule, that'll be a red flag for legislators to consider repealing it.

The bill also directs the State Board of Education to reexamine how long and how often teachers have to go through training on topics from bullying to epilepsy. Teachers must undergo training on nearly two dozen topics. Jordan says they're all worthy subjects in isolation, but the accumulation of them is too much. The bill asks the State Board to try to at least spread out the schedule.

The bill also makes good on House Republicans and Governor Holcomb's pledge to repeal a six-month-old externship requirement calling on teachers to spend 15 hours with a local business to keep up-to-date on job opportunities for their students.

The reason tickets are non-transferable to begin with is to combat reseller websites like stubhub, seatgeek, cheaptickets etc. These websites, and the ones like them, buy all of the tickets as soon as they become available. They then turn around and sell them for a much higher price than they paid. This makes it more difficult for lower income people to go to concerts they would have otherwise been able to afford. When a ticket is non-transferable, only the person who bought it can use it. So they can't buy and then immediately sell it at a higher price. Granted, these websites use several different accounts to buy up as many tickets as possible - not just one account. But the end result is exactly the same. The tickets are bought by resellers who are able to sell them - transfer them - and make a huge profit for zero work. Non-transferable tickets are good for consumers, not bad.",1580325815,ffxiho8

While yes someone could put in the effort to work around all these the question then becomes ""is the profit from resale worth all this trouble?""

Not to mention your implied scenario the venues are already selling the tickets at an undervalued price (which seems highly unlikely) sure there are purchases like food, beverages, and merch that happen after the fact but those limits still apply to your ""lower income people going to concerts.""

3291,Dirtroadrocker," 'Free' healthcare is a government solution to a government problem.  The reason healthcare costs have exploded are due to a number of factors:

1. Beginning in WWII, the government mandated that employers provide health insurance to their employees.  A win, right?  Except now the insurance companies have a market with a proverbial gun to their head.  They can't not buy their product, so why should the insurance companies attempt to lower their costs?

2.  Once (most) everyone had insurance, the medical field realized they could charge more now, because again- they had a captured market.  The insurance companies were on the line for money, so they'd have to pay it, and costs spiraled up.

So, you propose that we use government to fix government rooted problems.  Great.

You say that there's a lack of education that has led to decreased skilled labor, yet more people go to college than ever before.  So how do we have a decrease in skilled labor again?

But that's not what the Democrats are concerned with, they're concerned with spending other people's money to buy votes, by promising free things, like free college.

But a better educated society is always a good thing, you say.  Everyone should go to college you say.   This has led us to where we are today- government backed loans and the government protections of the banks to prevent people from defaulting on student loans has led to increased college tuition. Again a case of government monetary guarantees leading to people saying we need government to fix problems.

That's not getting into the other problem with 'free' college- the fact that almost inevitably it will lead to them becoming essentially high school 2.0- another extension of the public education system that is already failing students.  Standardized tests to make sure that the college is 'doing it's job' to secure government funds, government outlined education plans, etc.  Additionally, you've seen that the value of a high school degree is decreasing as more people have college degrees- what happens to the value of a college degree when everyone has one?  Now you've got to go get your Master's to set yourself apart from the crowd, and then the cycle begins again of people wanting to get that for free too.

And free healthcare has some major pitfalls too, like the fact that now the government has an interest in controlling your body.  I should be able to live as I want, and eat what I want, not excercise, and weight a million pounds, because that impacts only me.  I'm in no way advocating this kind of lifestyle, but why should someone not be able to do with their body what they want, so long as they are not impacting others?  Why should reasonable people who enjoy them in moderation be told that now they can't have regular cookies, the only thing you can get are low-sugar, low-carb, low-fat cookies, because the government has taxed or banned normal ones?

The free money I'm talking about is not the standard deduction- I'm talking about people like Yang promising everyone thousands of dollars.  How will that not cause massive inflation?  His plan also doesn't nearly account for all of that money, even with his 10% VAT (which I'm sure would work so well at not impacting the poor- look at the EU, which only taxes 'non essential' items.  You know, like feminine hygene products).  Again, why would landlords, companies, and everyone else not just raise prices now that they have that much more income they can get from purchasers?  Same with increases to the minimum wage- when everyone makes $15/hour, why should companies not charge more, when their consumers now have more money to spend on their products.  So then my $40/hour now has less spending power.  So you can't say it 'doesn't impact me'.

If anyone learned not to shove their opinions into law, they wouldn't be a Democrat or Republican.",1580395344,ffzxe4i

""Canadian health care expenditures work out to just shy of $6,000 per capita per year, compared to the top-ranked U.S. with $8,233. In Canada, nearly all of the $6,000 is funded via taxes. Less than half of that comes from income taxes with the bulk of the costs bankrolled by corporate and sales taxes."" 

Well that's good, you think- tax the companies!  They make tons of money, they can pay!  But why would they not just pass those increased costs on to consumers?  I know they wouldn't all come back to consumers, but it still wouldn't drive the per-capita cost down as much as many claim.  Not to mention the US government is not a shining model of efficancy, so how much of that savings will get blown in all the administrative costs?

https://www.investopedia.com/insurance/why-do-healthcare-costs-keep-rising/

""The average increase in premium costs in 2018 for people on a private plan or a healthcare exchange was $201. The two most-cited reasons for these increases were government policy and lifestyle changes.

Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid have increased overall demand for medical services—resulting in higher prices. Also, increases in the incidence of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease have had a direct impact on increases in the cost of medical care. Those two diseases alone are responsible for 85% of health care costs, and almost half of all Americans have a chronic illness.""

So lets look at this like a politician would: ""Hey, diabetes and heart disease are 85% of our costs.  So I'll introduce a bill to force manufacturers to reduce sugar and sodium in their products, and we'll save millions!""  So now I can go get my once-a-month pop and bag o' salty snacks, but now they taste like shit, because Big Brother had to meddle with shit.  Look at England and the taxes and laws they've imposed on their food producers.

And before you scream about it being some right wing site, look at this article that extoles the virtues of Single payer: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080615/6-reasons-healthcare-so-expensive-us.asp

I can absolutely acknowledge that there are benefits, and I can't knock them.  Government mandated drug pricing would drive down costs, and single payer does present an opportunity to lower costs in other ways.  However, I don't believe that the government manages money well (how much of the taxes for this will get diverted to buy another fucking fighter jet?), and I think the likely impact on personal bodily autonomy is too great.

I do think there's one public health action that the government should take- desubsidize corn.  It would reduce government intervention in the markets, correcting the price of corn to suppliers, and reducing the ammount of HFCS that is in so many products in the US.

As far as the 75% gun stat- no, I will freely admit I cannot back that up.  Best estimates I can find range from 40%-50% of all firearms are semi-automatic.  However, given that there are an average of 1.2 guns per citizen, and according to Pew research, 30% of the US owns one or more gun, that'd be say that your average gun owner owns 4 guns.  Given that each of those has a 40-50% likelyhood of being a semi-automatic, that'd say that means that they're about 80%-100% likely to own a semi-automatic firearm.  Semi-autos are the current 'hot topic' firearm, and exactly what the Virginia Governor is attempting to ban- turning millions of gun owners in the state into felons, because of the actions of a few.

There's an oft quoted copypasta that is incorrect about gun violence in the US- they say 30k per year, when the most widely acceptage average is 33k (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/?ez_cid=CLIENT_ID(AMP_ECID_EZOIC)).  2/3rds are suicide- sad, yes, and there are studies that show that access to a firearm does increase likelyhood of suicide- However, suicide is a personal issue.  Yes it does impact family, friends, and the community, but it is not about imposing your will on another, like homicide is.  Speaking of which, it accounts for 12000 firearms deaths per year, according to that same research.  Unfortunately (and much to their political bias), that number is not broken down further into which homicides are the result of self defense, gang activity, or just murder.  Let's play it safe, and say 50% of those are just murder (we will neglect the self defense cases, as they are evidence for legal gun ownership, and gang violence, as many of those guns are illegally obtained, and used in the perpetration of other crimes anyways).  That leaves us 6000 murders per year.  That means that 6000 people in the whole country are the reason that 98 million (again, that's the 30% of Americans that own one or more guns, per Pew) are being told that they are murders, and should have to give up their ownership of a firearm. That is around than 00.006% How is that fair, justice, or equity?  People should be punished for actions, not simple possessions.  If .006% people of some other minority did something people didn't like, the rest of the community should not be punished, only those who do wrong.


And I'm not sure how rallying for free college isn't rallying for everyone to go to college.  I don't think it's like how public school is, where you have to go, or they'll send the truancy officer after you.  But it is in effect putting the burden to attend on everyone- qualified or not.  One only has to look to Britain to see where it would head: https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2019/08/great-university-con-how-british-degree-lost-its-value

The professors are under pressure to raise grades- not only to make the UK look better, but to ensure continued government funding.

3390,smaller_god,"Alright I know these things are probably more or less obvious to the more rational hoosiers, but the lack of real action against climate change boils down to only 2 or 3 factors I’d say.

First, our capitalistic systems simply isn’t built to respond to something like this.  I haven’t read up a lot on the carbon tax but seems like the right direction.  Just have to avoid it becoming regressive.  But there’s no financial incentive for businesses to control their rates of CO2 release.

But the connected factor is, how do we get most hoosiers (and Americans) on board with the idea of drastically changing their lives?
I know we blame just general ignorance, but I’d wager there are some hoosiers who are not denying climate change but simply don’t want to acknowledge or think about climate change and the coming future because it right now IT IS *DARK*.  

If you live outside of a major city like me, you probably know or feel what I’m talking about.  The economy isn’t working for a lot of people.  Lot’s of people are struggling to hold their place in the last pockets of the *old* economy.  Others simply don’t have a place anymore.  

To highlight one broad and easy example, EV manufacturing.  Overall, EV’s require less labor to build.  It was one of the points of the GM strike, and it’s estimated the transition to electric vehicles would cost the UAW 35,000 jobs in the next few years.

Hoosiers simply aren’t going to get excited about a new economy that their roles are lost in.  And the GOP and fossil fuel companies will harvest that political capital for victory as they have been.

You offer them a change that is better that what their lives are like now. 

That's the core problem. All of climate activism is centered on coercing individuals to accept a *lower* standard of life, transportation, freedom, and agency. 

The second core problem with climate advocacy is the insistence on trying to exploit the shock doctrine of climate change to coattail-ride a whole bunch of unrelated, unpopular social changes in. It's not enough to take climate measures, climate has to be used as a lever to force socialism and crazypants gender politics and reparations and everything else on the radical wish list. It can't *only* be about climate, it has to be about *everything*. 

So as long as what they're selling is a dramatic drop in standard of living, coupled with a radical ideologically-driven capsizing of the entire social structure, they're not going to get people on board.

People wonder why Hoosiers and other Rust Belters are voting for folks on the extreme ends of the political spectrum, and it is a combination of hopelessness and a failure of the much vaunted American Dream to bring lasting fortune to the region.

I went to a lecture at IU from a guest professor, and the lecture was primarily about the use of fear in Roman-era propaganda, particularly the fall of the Republic and the establishment of the Empire, and his ignorance of the Midwest went beyond frustrating and into outright hateful. He was from SoCal and taught at UCLA, and he opened his lecture by relaying a time he was listening to the radio before the 2016 election, and he heard a Trump speech. In it, Trump talked about the decline of American industry, the out of control crime and poverty rates in urban environments, the lack of jobs, and the empty, abandoned factories dotting the Midwest. This professor then said ""and as I drove down the interstate looking at the gleaming towers of LA and the swaying palms in the afternoon sun, I wondered if he was talking about the same country."" The professor then accused Trump of ""making it all up"" and claiming it was baseless fearmongering.

I felt so much rage at that part of the lecture. I'm not a Trump supporter: far from it, but only an imbecile would say that Trump didn't get some things right, and his campaign was dismally accurate in its portrayal of the Rust Belt. Go to Gary (don't drive over it on I-94: **GO TO GARY**) and you'll see what amounts to a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Poverty and crime is so rampant that it can be seen just driving down the street. It smells of waste from the massive treatment plant and the mills, creating a sickly sulfuric miasma that hangs over the city like a cloud of death. Abandoned and crumbling buildings are everywhere: reminders of a sadly bygone age. It feels like you are playing *Fallout 3*.

But so many people don't understand that. They live on the coasts, where life is still good and the American Dream is very much alive. They live in their ignorant upper-middle-class bubbles and don't see the reality that tens of millions of Americans face every day. Why? Because we are flyover country. Nobody gives a single shit about the Midwest. Even Donald Trump was just saying that to win votes; he's a dyed-in-the-wool New York elite. Why would he give a flying fuck about us? To people like him we are just corn and white trash. At best, we are a means to an end for slimy assholes to win votes.

The Rust Belt is like a giant national ghetto. The jobs moved out and the drugs moved in. White, black, and Hispanic all get to live in the shit because the genius Nixon admin decided that opening ourselves up to cheap Chinese steel was worth the trade off of millions losing their livelihoods. The spineless neoliberal fucks and the Neo-classical corporate bootlickers (who ironically originate from the University of Chicago) decided that moving industry away from the Midwest was better for their bottom line, and damn the people living here. It was all about making more money and more profit. Generations of loyal workers thrown aside because a Chinese sweatshop could churn out steel cheaper and quicker. And all the tertiary industries and services that relied on the steel industry and steel workers disappeared soon after.

It is an indictment of the modern system, and dare I say it, of capitalism as a whole. Livelihoods, human happiness, sustainability... none of it matters, as it is all about making more dough.

The colleges stay alive mostly because of a large out-of-state student body, and ironically because of the Chinese. Those people will graduate and take their skills elsewhere, giving no benefit to the Midwest at all.

It took me a while to realize why places like Berlin felt so different, even though they have the same weather, same air, and same topography, and I now realize, it's because they have hope. The Midwest is a hopeless wasteland where every day spent is a reminder that you will one day have to leave if you want to make anything of yourself and leave a reasonable life. Most other places don't struggle with this, not to the degree that we do. Most other places can believe that a brighter future is ahead.

3494,DoktorSoviet,"As someone from Indy you are probably acutely aware that the Midwest is very traditional when it comes to meeting new people, which is to say it is predominantly done through family introducing you, through school or work, or through other friends introducing you.

Your best bet is to just talk to people at the bar. Other than those methods mentioned above, this is the traditional ""get to know other people"" setting. Get interested in professional sports as it is a good conversation starter.

That probably isn't helpful but I don't know what else to say. South Bend is not a big cosmopolitan city, certainly not like Chicago, so there isn't going to be as much to do and meeting people is going to be harder. You might have to learn to enjoy being fairly solitary.

If you just want something fun, you absolutely should start doing outdoors activities. Indiana does have some surprisingly nice parks, although the topography of the South Bend area is a bit... flat. Fishing and hunting are also fun activities and something you might not have had a lot of experience with, being a city boy and all. Kayaking, canoeing, and boating are also great fun, and given our unseasonably warm winter, you should be able to start doing those things soon.

Livestock rearing methods (factory farming) need to change, as a result meat'll probably become more expense, but we basically have the wealth to just give citizens money, or subsidize the new livestock farms so they can maintain a cheaper price.  (former would probably work better though IMO.

With that example, again what I'm trying to say is that it is more than possible facilitating these kinds of transitions while keeping those most affected by them from having their living standards drastically dropped.",1580509584,fg4rmvw

Yes, there's a reason Trump is being impeached. He beat Hillary the Annointed in 2016. that's why he's being impeached. The Democrats made it clear from the moment Trump, for whom I did not vote, came down the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy, that they were out for his blood.

They tried with the Russian collusion hoax. Turns out, it was Hillary's camp that was colluding with the Russians. They failed with Mueller who turned out to be something of an absent minded professor type. They tried to trump up (pun intended) obstruction charges relating to the Mueller probe. Finally, they had to get a disgruntled CIA spook with an axe to grind to gin up controversy around a phone call with the Ukrainian President.

Frankly, I want to see a full airing of the Bidens' dirty laundry too.

The Democrats have done nothing since 2018 but prove that they are incompetent to govern. And if I thought about it just a little bit, since long before that.

I mean, just look at the front running 5 for the Democrat Primary race and it's plain to all concerned just how uninterested the entirety of the Democrat Party is in actually governing a free nation.",1580520988,fg58k9j
3539,WeimarRepublic,"&gt;The president is being impeached for a reason!

Because Democrats have campaigned on it since before he was elected.  Couldn't get him on the emoluments clause. Couldn't get him on Russian collusion. Now it's just the nebulous ""abuse of power"", which can mean literally anything and isn't a crime. The other charge of ""obstructing Congress"" isn't even applicable as the House didn't try to challenge the White House's claims of executive privilege 

&gt;Let’s hear the facts for both sides.

We did. In the House. And all that material was reviewed by the Senate

&gt;Mike Braun was endorsed by President Trump, so he probably thinks he owes Trump something.

This isn't even an argument. So every democrat that was endorsed by Obama or Hillary owes them one, right?

&gt;I am so tried of the political bs in Indiana

*Everyone who doesn't think like me is bad*

You should be mad at the House for getting your hopes up with a shit case, not with the Senate for rightly not setting the bar for impeachment so low that every president from here on out would walk right into it.

3652,MyIndianaLife,"Note sure if you've made your decision yet or not, but I wanted to tell you this as well.  After three years in operation (new construction), our pit alarm went off.  I had no idea what to do or what was going on.  Guys came out, pump was still running!  I couldn't hear it due to traffic.  Thankfully it didn't burn out.  I had to call a septic cleaning company (because the pit is basically like a sewer tank) and that was around $350 for cleaning it out.  Then it was almost another $1,000 in repair time/new piping parts.  The repair guys said it felt like all the connections were never tightened down properly.  The main discharge valve had separated from the main tank line connection and thus the water was just staying in the tank.  Had the pump burned out, it would've been an additional $1,800 for the pump (our sewer company allows for a three year loan on this).

If you do need a grinder pit system installed, call the sewer company and ask for recommendations.  If they refuse, individually email anyone in maintenance if they can give a recommendation.  Ask on Facebook who has had these systems installed.  When they work, they work, but when they fail, it can be costly to repair.  I tell everyone who is on such a system to add another $2K to their emergency fund amount because of the costs.

3653,MyIndianaLife,"The reason wages for state workers and teachers is so low is because the pension is tied to the wage.  Indiana doesn't want to just rack up debt and pretend it is no big deal like other states that are technically bankrupt due to their overly generous pension payouts.

Here is the pension formula for teachers and state employees:

(Average of the highest five years of pay) x (Years of service) x .011 = Yearly payout.  The state doesn't want to take on even more legacy costs that it can't afford.

In addition there is an annuity where 3% of gross pay is contributed every year.  Not sure if this comes from the teacher's take home pay or from the district.

Two things need to happen with teaching, and a lesser extent, public safety.  New people coming into the profession need to be placed in a 401(k) type retirement plan, not a lifetime pension plan based on wages.  Then, there needs to be a set wage matrix, mostly based on years of service/education level obtained.  The pay for the last ten years of a thirty year career needs to be substantial. It needs to be financially rewarding enough to keep people here for that last ten years and allow for them to bank enough additional retirement savings in addition to the lower 401(k) savings they'd get.",1580572288,fg6n68j

Some people just don't grasp reality, especially on the coasts and high cost of living areas.  They aren't paying their fair share of taxes, given the billions those states in debt to pensions.  They are OK living in debt for decades of their life, so long as when they retire, they have just enough to live on.  However, some are finding out that life isn't that easy, so what do they do: Demand government provided healthcare, government provided higher ed, government provided student loan bailouts, etc..

MARTINSVILLE, Ind. (WTHR) — A man who has made himself somewhat of a nuisance to law enforcement across the country wants police to know he’s in town.

The ""Piggyback Bandit"" who's real name is Sherwin Shayegan has cases in eight states from Washington to Virginia and New Jersey to Alabama. Now he's made his way to Indiana. The Washington State native made contact with a Martinsville Police Department officer after a Lyft driver took off with Shayegan’s personal belongings still in the car.

Martinsville PD and an Indiana State Police trooper helped Shayegan recover his belongings. He and the Lyft driver had a disagreement so the driver drove away. During the call to police Shayegan made himself known as the ""Piggyback Bandit"" to officers several times on the phone and in person.

One of the phone conversations took place between Sherwin and Police Chief Kurt Spivey.

“From the telephone conversation I had with him he seems to be visiting family here...family somewhere in the area,” Chief Spivey said.

Based on Shayegan’s behavior Spivey and his officers did a little digging on him. They learned about the ""Piggyback Bandit"" and his encounters with law enforcement in multiple states. They also obtained a copy of one of the booking photos of Shayegan who’s become somewhat of a nuisance to law enforcement from state to state.

“We also learned that he does have a couple of warrants in other states that are not considered serious enough in Indiana for extradition,” Spivey said.

Shayegan gained the reputation because he jumps on the back of unsuspecting athletes at high school games.

It last happened in 2018 in Alabama where Shayegan was charged with harassment because he hopped on the back of a football player and handed him vulgar written messages.

Now the so called ""Piggyback Bandit"" is in Central Indiana.

MARTINSVILLE, Ind. (WTHR) — A man who has made himself somewhat of a nuisance to law enforcement across the country wants police to know he’s in town.

The ""Piggyback Bandit"" who's real name is Sherwin Shayegan has cases in eight states from Washington to Virginia and New Jersey to Alabama. Now he's made his way to Indiana. The Washington State native made contact with a Martinsville Police Department officer after a Lyft driver took off with Shayegan’s personal belongings still in the car.

“We also learned that he does have a couple of warrants in other states that are not considered serious enough in Indiana for extradition,” Spivey said.

Shayegan gained the reputation because he jumps on the back of unsuspecting athletes at high school games.

It last happened in 2018 in Alabama where Shayegan was charged with harassment because he hopped on the back of a football player and handed him vulgar written messages.

Now the so called “Piggyback Bandit” is in central Indiana.

Chief Spivey made it clear right away that the ""Piggyback Bandit's"" behavior would not be tolerated in Martinsville.

“We just mentioned we would appreciate if he stayed away from our schools and not enter that would be considered trespass. He's not under investigation of any type. Like I said, he has a large following and is well known for this persona he's created as the 'Piggyback Bandit,'” Chief Spivey said.

Shayegan is banned from high school sporting events in five states. Chief Spivey notified Martinsville schools and the superintendent alerted the schools to be on the lookout. The message to the staff said “this is not a joke” and to remember the rules regarding visitors, doors left open and to say something if you see something.

3690,LysanderSporker,"&gt; huge farms doing commoditized farming

Great!  Those huge farms are much more rationally-run, because they're able to take advantage of specialization (family farms can't do that because there are so few personnel that people have to be jacks-of-all-trades) and economies of scale, and because they're run as long-term profit-making ventures they have to be better husbands of the soil to keep it productive year after year.

Family farms tend to be hobby operations run by people who often don't even bother with something as basic as crop rotation because they don't actually care about running a long-term profit, so if the yields are super-low because they've been planting corn for fifteen years straight oh well, at least they got to look cool driving a tractor around.

3706,indianamedic,"Provides that a provider of ambulance service that transports a covered individual to an in network facility or from an in network facility to another facility shall not charge more than the amount allowed under the network plan applying to the covered individual's coverage.

Provides that an individual who is covered by an insurance policy or health maintenance organization contract and who receives emergency services provided by an out of network provider shall not be required to pay more for the emergency services than the amount of compensation that would be allowed under the network plan for emergency services of the same type provided in network by the same type of provider, minus any copayment, deductible, or coinsurance amounts that apply. Adopts a new model law on credit for reinsurance.

Basically the law wants to set a CAP on what is paid out by private insurance like Medicare and Medicaid does. So Indiana Medicaid only pays a flat rate fee for payment $350.00 for every thing REGARDLESS of what services are provided. BLS, ALS, CRITICAL CARE, or HELICOPTER TRANSPORT.  Medicade doesn't pay extra for oxygen, milage, medicine used during care in transport.
Medicare pays a flat rate for each services performed. ie BLS transport $400.00 ALS transport $600.00 etc. Then the ambulance service bill for oxygen use $60.00,  cardiac monitor use $150.00, milage for BLS $10.00 a mile ALS $16.00 a mile etc. That's how Medicare is billed. These are incorrect figures I'm just giving examples. 
The proposed bill aims for private insurance companies to pay a flat fee for EVERYTHING like Medicaid does, and it gives private insurance companies The Right to Set Fees for Services. 

That's the issue! Blue Cross Blue Shield is the lobby behind this bill. They are the LARGEST private insurance provider in the country. They made a PROFIT of almost 3 billion dollars last year. So if a flat rate fee is set to be paid out for ANY ambulance claim the extra charges will be billed to the customer ie the patient. So the insurance company can set a a max payout fee of $350.00 for an ambulance fee. The ambulance service bill is $1,000.00. We only get $350.00 out of $1,000.00. That's if it's not denied first like most insurance companies do. The extra cost goes to the consumer. 
The general public has no clue what it cost to provide an ambulance service.
A BLS service costs roughly $550.00 for a 12 hour shift. This is BLS LEVEL BASIC LIFE SUPPORT. 
From a business standpoint look what needs to be covered out of a set fee. 
EMT salary per hour
Ambulance vehicle vehicle insurance (always full coverage with lots of add ins by the vehicle insurance companies because well it's a fucking ambulance)
EMT health insurance
EMT uniform allows 
Fuel (gas or diesel they both have different price per gallon)
Rent or mortgage for base of operations 
Malpractice insurance (paid by the company or municipality)
Cost of ambulance (different types, Van's, van/box, etc usual cost is around $85,000 for the van type. Ohhhh they get really expensive!!! A type III MODEL with all the bells and whistles is about $390,00.00)
(This cost doesn't include the stretcher, that's a separate fee. A basic Ferno Corporation stretcher costs about $2,500.00. That fee doesn't include safety belts, OSHA specialized mattress. IV pole etc. Now you have to purchase the warranty on EVERYTHING and the locking system that's is proprietary.)
Average hour maintenance cost
(Each unit is assigned a maintenance cost for longevity of the ambulance)
Supplies ie oxygen mask, BLS drugs etc. (The state of Indiana REQUIRES a set minimum amount of supplies and special equipment for each ambulance. A Zoll Corporation Automated Defibrillator cost roughly around $1,700.00. That DOES NOT include batteries, defibrillator pads, or a carrying case. Lol see what I'm getting at)
Remember what I said before ? This is for ONE BLS ONLY these are just some cost of the REQUIRED state mandates. Theres more cost I just remember. Obviously all of these cost are not up front to run one BLS ambulance that's a given but you can see how expensive it is. This is only for a BLS unit. That's not ALS, or critical care. So take what you saw a triple that mind boggling amount of the BLS unit for an ALS Unit and then double that amount from ALS unit for a specialized critical care ambulance. This shit is expensive  !!!! We in Indiana are lucky we do not operate on a Tiered EMS system like most states do. That means each tiered level demands a different scope of practice with more equipment. Illinois operates on a tiered system of EMS. Illinois REQUIRES nurses to go on critical care ambulance calls. Critical care is a generic term in medicine to a point. In Illinois an IV infusion of a certain drug would require a nurse to go for the trandport... (which EMS could charge more money for the call) That's on the private transport side of EMS. Municipalities dont have nurses on an ambulance for treatment. Although Illinois has a nurse transport certificate basically circumventing a paramedic scope of practice. That's a different story. We paramedics are trained in Indiana between nursing level and physicians assistant scope of practice. So we do not require any extra help for critical care transports. So no tierd system in Indiana. That's why private services charge more money. If this bill passes then all private services are going to close up shop because it wont be profitable. So if you or your family member requires a life saving procedure at another hospital five blocks away or a few hundred miles away no Service will be around to transport you or your loved ones because the private company closed up. If you do get transported you will get billed the remaining costs of what was NOT covered under the flat rate fee system. A company has to remain profitable in order to operate. The same goes for the municipalities. Very few municipalities do not charge for transportation because the it is considered a SERVICE. Its expensive to run an ambulance way more then the police department or street development. So usually when budget time comes around every year the government fat cats start looking to cut corners. The first thing that usually goes is the ambulance service because it cost so much. The municipalities may charge a fee but they are losing money. So they contract out to a private service. Well guess what all the private sector closed up. So now your lives are danger because the town is going to close down the ambulance or make it strictly voluntary. This is the case in much of the USA. So no one responds to your heart attack at 2am, the closest cardiac level hospital is 45 minutes away. The closest hospital is five minutes. You go to the closest hospital and they do not do cath lab service for your heart attack. So they want to call a private service to take you. Oh guess what they all closed up. Now they call 911 to take you. But 911 is BLS ONLY they dont provide ALS critical care or no one shows up to answer the call at the station because its snoring in a blizzard and they are comfy in bed. And YOU were the politician that voted to change the law that affects payment. Your municipal EMS is volunteer they are getting paid to risk their life to drive your critical unstable body to a place 45 minutes away on a good day. So you die of that heart attack at age 50. This shit happens in the USA all the fucking time. I'm not making any of it up. So call your Indiana state representative and beg them not to vote yes.",1580633755,fg93ion
3707,Audiothered,"Playing devils advocate here, if what you said is even half true, Anthem would be shooting their own customers in the foot if this was the case- if someone dies as a result of service they're likely paying out in some fashion, and or losing their customers in the process on top of if the coverage shrinks. Which means less profit in the long run. Which runs contrary to the idea of this being some sort of big savings bill on their part. 

That aside, I doubt the market would collapse like you'd suggest, because there is little to no way such a massive oversight is not accounted for in the bill or by how they're now handling insurance which seems(?) to be coupled with a model from the NAIC. It's kind of hard to just argue that the economic structure is just going to vanish once this happens, because I doubt other professionals, insurance or otherwise, wouldn't be having an uproar in this case. And if the cost ends up in the consumer's hands, it's just going to bounce back to the provider anyway I'd imagine? If it doesn't, Anthem's going to kinda plummet in Indiana. Which goes back to the first suggestion- they're shooting themselves in the foot. Doubt you're not getting paid somehow through this new structure.

Unless you imagine the entire emergency service in Indiana will run on an extreme deficit as a result of this bill because I highly doubt that public hospitals won't adjust. In which case, I'd suggest you think about just who loses other than the small guy in this situation. Can't really choke out a system like this and not get on someone's bad side, especially as far as the state government in concerned. Just my thoughts in the end though, I suppose.",1580639515,fg9jcy7

Governments don't have a great track record when it comes to managing money.

Even far left leaning Illinois isn't taxing at a rate needed to really pay all these promised benefits, at least in relation to how things work in this country and basic mathematics.  And in the Chicago metro area, taxes on a $400Kish home is already close to or over five figures.  $10K in property taxes!  And we here in Indiana aren't even paying wages close to Chicagoland wages.

Now if you pay me what my job pays in say the Chicago metro area, $100K/year (an increase of $45K/year for me), then we can talk.  The only reason republicans took such control over the state is because the Democrat party didn't see, or care, that the school funding via property tax issue was coming and do something about it.

I'm sure there were some, maybe many, left leaning individuals living in Meridian-Kessler, Butler-Tarkington, etc. who voted against left leaning politicians due to the property tax issue.",1580654822,fgas8sj

3715,indianamedic,"I work for a private ambulance service. We have municipal 911 ambulance service contracts. My company was contracted with the  town of Chesterton and Burns Harbor Indiana for ALS ambulance service. My company pulled out and stopped serving those towns because it wasn't profitable. Those towns only had one ALS ambulance a piece. My company attempted to negotiate ambulance service for higher amounts to offset what the insurance industry paid for ambulance fees. They effectively asked each tomorrow for a $100,000.00 for three years more of services. Those towns didn't want to pay the difference and we pulled out. Chesterton now relies on mutual aide for service from other municipalities. Burns Harbor started their own ALS fire department ambulance. The fire department hired all part time personnel with no benefits at $16.00 an hour at a 12 hour shift with no chance for overtime because they cant afford it. Chestertons mortality rate jumped by 50% in two months due to lack of EMS service. People who call 911 were waiting  45 minutes at times for ANY available mutual aid service for transportation to the hospital. Burns Harbor fire department went to a volunteer ambulance and pays paramedics only if staffed because they have trouble getting reimbursed for ambulance services and the town doesn't have money in the small budget to staff the ambulance full time anymore. This is exactly the issue I'm talking about that can happen. This real life scenario happens every week in the USA. Indiana is not immune at all. If we had a built in tax fee for ambulance services in Indiana that would probably eliminate any billing issues because the money to pay for services would already be set aside. Omg... sounds like National Health Care that most countries have... oh my god.. Do bbn you know it you live in Canada and if you need an ambulance, you are never charged a fee because they have national health service. No fees at all. No ambulance fee, no doctor, no hospital fee etc. You pay ZERO

Having a boarded-up wreck in your neighborhood brings down your property's value.

It is also a matter of public interest that Indiana Landmarks does not enforce its covenants or easements and is not competent to perform even emergency maintenance.  They finance rehab projects that they think will make a profit.  All the other money goes to salaries, expense accounts, and conferences.  They are not going to spend a dime on anything else.

for backpacking, i'm a huge fan of knobstone.  but, as mentioned, if you're doing the knobstone in july (a) get yourself in pretty good shape, (b) cut your intended miles/day by a third and (c) bring plenty of water.

for general poking around and shorter hikes, the state parks are very nice as is the hoosier national forest.  if you're looking to car camp, hardin ridge is nice if you want amenities or if not, just pull off somewhere in the backcountry area.

if you're paddling, the backwaters of salt creek are great if the water level isn't too low.

or sugar creek (not really southern) for a two day trip has a nice canoe camp area right on the creek.  its a beautiful little stream.

I tried all the things other people on this thread are suggesting to do and none of it helped (for example, [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) was a big joke, there are barely even any groups here). Never found any rec sports groups in the area. I also tried the Young Professionals networking and it was OK, but a lot of these people are married and have their own lives outside of their careers and networking. It is indeed really hard to find people here who are (to put it bluntly) child-free, educated, progessive (if that's important to you), into different hobbies etc. I just didn't find that in my 2 years here. Most of the young people that are here are from here, raised here, have a solid friend group already. And the young people in SB for university keep within the Notre Dame insulated bubble.

One day we drove about an hour north to Cave Run Lake and rented a boat for a few hours.

Eventually I plan to get down to the southern part of the Daniel Boone NF.  Cumberland Falls state park is down this way along with Laurel River Lake.  I'd also like to finally visit Berea and check out the town.

The elementary schools have won all kinds of academic awards and many of the schools' academic teams have come in the top 10 in the state. The classes are around 20-24 students with 1 high school for the entire county that has about 800 students. The schools have won nationals in we the people, band, track, and have won their sectionals and wic in basketball and volleyball. The high school theater dept is really top notch. And, it is small town so the teachers really do care for their students. Heck, most parents are on a first name basis with all the principals and the superintendent. The bus driver calls me if the weather is weird so I know when I go to work. It is an amazing comminity.
With that being said, there obviously needs more mental health there. I have been trying to get that in our schools for a year. There is obviously a drug problem. Like all high schools. 
We obviously dont have a multi million dollar football team. Our teachers havent had a raise in 5 years or something stupid. We are extremely small. Oh, and driving through town in october to get to the school makes me crazy and can take 45 minutes. Lol however, my son had a class at the state park one year, they have a manufacturing program, access to vocational training, and access to college courses as well.

In Indiana it isn't such a risk. You don't get as many days of below zero weather.

The scary and sad thing is I have seen a group of people that are perfectly happy with the elderly dying in these situations, because it means they can't vote any more if they are dead.

Hanlon's razor is an aphorism expressed in various ways, including:



Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

Probably named after a Robert J. Hanlon, it is a philosophical razor which suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for human behavior.

Project Blitz: The Christian Nationalist Attack on America




Project Blitz’s Dangerous Model Bills



The guide instructs Christian nationalists to work in three phases. 

First, they are supposed to pass bills that are expected to receive the least opposition. These “religious heritage” bills encourage or force public schools to offer Bible classes and display “In God We Trust,” as well as mandate the creation of “In God We Trust” license plates. 

This first seemingly innocuous phase is meant to build enough momentum to pass “religious history and freedom” bills, which purport that America was, is, and will always be a Christian nation. Examples include “Year of the Bible” and “Christian Heritage Week” bills.

After grabbing this “low hanging fruit,” Christian nationalists move on to more dangerous bills that undermine equality by allowing discrimination in child welfare and religious refusals in health care.",1580891865,fglda5o

The first involved a woman in her fifties who worked over the wall from me for four or five years. We would talk casually about work topics and what our weekend plans were, but never anything too personal. But one day she was talking about a ""gospel sing"" she was attending that upcoming weekend, and asked ""what church do YOU go to?"" I told her I wasn't a churchgoer. She pressed ""well, you read the Bible, right?"" I said no I didn't, very politely. Then of course the big question. ""Are you an atheist?"" I said yes. She literally gasps. I awkwardly say something to the effect of ""yeah, there are a few of us out there""... She never spoke to me again, even on the few occasions when I attempted to speak to her.

The second one was an older man in his late sixties who was very Catholic. No meat on Fridays. Came to work on Ash Wednesday with ash on his forehead. Very involved in Knights of Columbus. Etc... We talked quite a bit about work topics. Really nothing personal. And I worked closer with him than the woman in the first instance. But once he pulled into the parking lot behind me and saw my Obama bumper sticker. This was in 2012... We were working on something and he just started asking me political questions out of nowhere. I'm an honest person, so I answered. And of course the topic turns to abortion. And of course I'm pro-choice. So that leads to religion. And me being atheist... Our work relationship was mostly the same after that. But I later found out that he had mentioned to other people in the office that he was totally confused as to how I was such a ""nice person"" and ""good coworker"" when I was an atheist.

4203,DoktorSoviet,"And Lenin, by his own definition, achieved neither.

Lenin was the codifier of [Marxism-Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism), an ideology that was explicitly not communist nor socialist. Why is that? Because Marxism-Leninism was predicated on the belief that Russia was under-industrialized and did not have a large enough urban proletariat to create a sustainable socialist society. Basically, Russia hadn't even reached the stage of capitalistic development necessary to create a socialist revolution in the first place. To make up for this shortcoming, Lenin believed in a ""Vanguard Party"" that would command the country as a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"", who would industrialize the nation to necessary levels to create an actual socialist society. [That was the ""first stage"" of the ""two-stage revolution"", with the second stage being an actual socialist revolution.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage_theory) Lenin basically considered his ideology ""pre-socialist"".

And debatably he is right that the goal of socialism *is* communism, but communism does not mean what you think it means. Decades of political ignorance and propaganda have caused Americans to conflate the idea of ""communism"" with Stalin and Mao, with one-party dictatorships and state ownership of industries. None of those things are what communism is. Communism is the term for the society that would emerge after the successful implementation of socialism. It is a stateless, classless society where each individual gives what they can, and each individual takes what they need, so that everybody provides for one another and creates an equal society. [""From each according to their ability, to each according to their need""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs) is the official communist mantra ala Karl Marx.

Now, you can debate whether or not such a society is actually achievable, but using the term ""Communist"" to describe a Marxist-Leninist like Lenin, or Stalin, or Mao, is a complete misuse of the term. I understand why it is confusing though, considering most of these ""vanguard parties"" used the named ""communist"", such as the Chinese Communist Party, but as we know, names are deliberately deceiving in politics. After all, the National Socialist party was vehemently opposed to socialists and sent the actual socialists to concentration camps, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea is not Democratic nor a Republic, the Holy Roman Empire was not Holy, Roman, and is barely an Empire, and the Republican Party is no more devoted to representative government than the Democratic Party is opposed. These names are basically just slogans meant to convince slack-jawed idiots to support them, and are not really representative of reality, hence why the Communist Chinese Party has overseen the transition of their country towards capitalism.

And the point is moot anyways because Bernie Sanders is not even close to being an actual socialist. I will admit that Bernie himself does not seem to grasp what the term ""socialist"" means, as like many Americans his view of it has been filtered through decades of propaganda and is so malformed compared to the real theories of Marx and Engles that even he misuses the term. Bernie calls himself a ""[democratic socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism)"", which is basically someone who believes in common ownership of the means of production but with a democratic form of governance (Marx was basically a democratic socialist, for example), but his policies and stated beliefs are actually completely in line with [social democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy), which is totally different. Social democracy advocates for some industries to be publicly owned, like healthcare and education, but some industries can be privately owned. Unlike socialism, ownership of private property is allowed and it is arguably still a capitalist system, just one where the government participates as an active economic agent in the economy. Social democracy straddles the line between capitalism and socialism, and is meant to take the best aspects of both to create a better society. Some social democrats want the economy to eventually ""transition"" to a socialist one, rather than through revolution ala what Marx suggested, but many social democrats seek to preserve some form of private ownership and a free market. The US is actually a social-democratic country already, due to things like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Most modern countries are somewhere on the social-democratic spectrum.

This spreadsheet will show data from the Current Population Survey. Doing a quick excel analysis on this, it shows that approximately 90% of people in the US make less than 100k.

If you break out every income bracket percentage into number of Americans (Ex: between 30k and 40k is 10.54%, or 34.4M Americans), and multiply by the amount they would pay ($40*34.4M), and do that for every group you can see how much money would be taxed to cover this, per year. 

Since the data only specifies &gt;100k (9.81% of americans, 32M) income bracket, assume everyone over 100k pays 38,840 per year. everyone below 100k pays as listed. 

You'd end up generating approximately 1.355T per year in taxes. 

Coincidentally if you divide 32T by 10 years you get 3.2T (you'd need to tax that much to cover it.) The deficit would be almost 2T dollars per year... either Bernie is doing some magic math here or everyone earning less than 100k per year would have to pay more than indicated.

However if your vehicle is broken into/stolen in this time period and the doc is no longer in your possession, you then have no means to transfer title until the prior owner can get a duplicate to reassign to you (if they even will- some people are weird about this stuff) meaning you don’t have much in the way of an insurance claim etc, and if you do, it will at least be harder on you. When you purchase with title in hand, always take the title immediately home and store it safely until you can get to the BMV, but don’t leave it in your vehicle. Use the fully completed bill of sale in its place until then. You can back up the bill of sale with a copy of the title, if you feel like you want extra security in the face of a traffic stop.

Oh, btw, to obtain a handicapped placard your doctor has to diagnose you as DISABLED!  Being handicapped is being disabled. 

State form 42070, doctors have to sign off one of the following:


1. A physical disability that requires the use of a wheelchair, a walker, braces, or crutches.

2.Lost the use of one (1) or both legs.

3. A severe restriction in mobility due to a pulmonary or cardiovascular disability, an arthritic condition, or an orthopedic or neurological impairment. 

4. Blind (as defined in IC 12-7-2-21(2)) or visually impaired (as defined in IC 12-7-2-198).

So, 1,2 and 4 are out, and asthma isn’t shown on the form whatsoever.  

MILLIONS of people have asthma, it’s not a disabling condition worthy of a placard. Take 2 puffs off your albuterol and suck it up, buttercup!

4718,DapperDanManCan,"I don't care what he does with his money. It has absolutely no relevance to the discussion. You are too dimwitted to understand apparently. Let me try to ELI5 it for you.

Indiana is a Republican state in the midwest, meaning it has negative job growth and a terrible economy compared to every Democrat state in the country. All Republican states are like this besides Texas, which is purple anyway. Republican states always have terrible economies and bad education systems.

Now, in a state with negative growth, a terrible economy, low wages, few/bad social safety nets (again, because Republican), and a piss poor education system (again, because Republican), jobs are a zero sum game. Nobody is doing better unless they get promoted, because there are no alternative jobs to create wage competition.

So, where do old people that refuse to retire come into play? Well, they are taking those promotions away from younger generations of adults, because they never leave an empty spot. That both keeps those generations in lower paying positions, but also keeps their kids unemployed, because nothing is opening up. Meanwhile, people at middle-age want to start a family, but families cost money that low men on the totem pole wont be making enough of. This means they either cant start a family at all, or they impoverish themselves to do so. Their kids are even worse off of course, because even when the older generations die, their parents now HAVE to work until they die, since they didnt make real money until they were old. 

This cycle perpetuates, eventually leaving the kids in abject poverty if they dont leave. The only solution is to leave the state entirely if they have any intelligence at all, causing massive brain drain. The only ones that remain are people with little to no education, few skills, and low intelligence. Hence, states like Indiana continue to get worse and worse over time.

...in not paying teachers a living wage! Lowest pay hikes in the nation since Republicans took over in the early 2000s. They've actually lost wages due to inflation, and now Indiana cant find new teachers to replace them. 

...in the economy! Three out of Indiana's four surrounding states — Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio all have significantly better economies. Kentucky is Republican though so... they're doing poorly.

...in the environment! It's ranked 48th in the nation. 

...in healthcare! Its ranked 40th in the nation.

...in crumbling infrastructure! 37th in the nation.

...in crime! 34th in the nation.

I tried to make it go higher to end on good notes for you. There is one positive too!

As for military action, we do have input at the ballot box. The president sets foreign policy and gives the final say. For example, the continuation of the Obama military doctrine via Hillary Clinton was rejected at the ballot box. If the military operated independently of the president we would have continued on to Moscow after taking Berlin.

As for air travel/traffic, flying has become more affordable through deregulation via Reagan. 

Financial institutions? Our government representatives bailed out their friends after the most recent financial crisis. If you want more “too big to fail, too big to jail,” keep trusting the government. We need to end the federal reserve and return to sound money and increase currency diversity.

&gt; Socialism doesn't work

Bolivia is an example of a fully socialist country that absolutely has worked. Regardless, Sanders doesn't want to turn the country into fully socialist, but rather democratic socialist, which is entirely different.

Democratic Socialism vs. Socialism

Both democratic socialism and socialism advocate for a redistribution of wealth and power to meet public needs, not make profits for a few. Both aim to weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of the working people.

Democratic socialists, however, do not think the government should immediately take control of all aspects of the economy. Democratic socialism focuses more on providing basic needs to all people, such as health care and education. Democratic socialism, unlike socialism, would achieve this through democratic means and not an authoritarian rule.

&gt; Sanders is a communist-sympathiser

This is a made up statement based on your feelings with no basis in reality. 

&gt; open borders has never worked in the history of the world. Look at what open borders did to Europe. Sweden is allowed a bunch of immigrants rape their kids and don't do anything about it because ""it's racist to stop their culture"".

It's a good thing he doesn't support open borders (https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/bernie-sanders-open-borders-1261392). He wants comprehensive immigration reform, including the cessation of putting kids in cages and forced familial separations, as well as the cessation of deportation of non-violet aliens. 

&gt; Also, free health care does increase taxes look at any country with it they pay higher taxes than most of the US. Same with free college.

Yes your taxes would go up, but for the vast majority of people, the taxes you pay for universal healthcare would be less than you currently pay for premiums, deductibles, co-pays, and out of network nonsense. It also removes the middlemen insurance companies. Nobody should profit off of basic human right services. Finally, it would provide healthcare to all Americans irregardless of where they work, how many people their company employs, whether their spouse works, etc. 

Additionally, an increase tax rate for the top earners in the country, combined with closing tax loopholes the corporations utilize would provide funding for these initiatives.

five words, two of them colloquial curses, and grammatically incorrect ones at that, and you're the one calling me a retard when I'm arguing that the children you claim to care about could be better educated via a system of individualized learning?

E-learning isn't just giving your students a timed 60-second math worksheet so the teacher could drink her coffee in peace (in the early 90s, no elementary teachers had cell phones).  E-learning allows teachers to focus more on the needs of individual students and increased the effectiveness of the teacher to student ratio. 

you ""random strangers"" are people who think you know best because you got a load of bullshit shoveled into your brains by Fox News because you're too stupid to think critically, because you didn't have teachers like me or any of the other ""liberal snowflakes"" you so decry when you were growing up.

And cold snaps are definitely a predicted part of average global temperature rising. It's due to increased upper atmosphere swirling and churning. Warm fronts and cold fronts move faster which allows them to reach places they normally wouldn't get to without mellowing or dissipating.

E-learning doesn't correlate with quality learning any more than in-classroom instruction does, and given some of the programs that are available to E-learning tablets, can in fact *increase* the one-on-one teaching efficacy of educators (who thanks to the GOP led cutbacks in education funding, are getting scarcer and scarcer while becoming more and more stressed, year after year).  For the *idiots* out there (sorry, I'm being petty and I know it but they have it coming) this means that if your child ~~inherits your trump supporting intelligence genes~~ consistently misspells words like ""beautiful"" or ""gradual"" or consistently has trouble with his x7 multiplication tables, the software can detect those consistent learning difficulties and notify your child's teacher so that they can focus their time with your child/their student in ways that best suit the student.

On the other hand, yes, E-learning does cut jobs like janitorial staff, nursing staff, face-to-face administrators, and E-learning *does* become less effective as students begin to specialize in their education (which I would conservatively guess happens about 15-16 years old). E-learning isn't perfect, but hey- I'm publicly and militantly in favor of developing progressive education systems, including E-learning, that my tax dollars will pay for, knowing full well that eventually I might be replaced by an AI on a tablet.

This is certainly a problem that money can solve. Higher teacher salaries and smaller class sizes both directly correlate to improved student performance, *hundreds* of studies have proven this over and over.

4994,d0ntblink,"&gt; In particle physics, a pion (or a pi meson, denoted with the Greek letter pi: 
&gt; π
&gt; ) is any of three subatomic particles: 
&gt; π0
&gt; , 
&gt; π+
&gt; , and 
&gt; π−
&gt; . Each pion consists of a quark and an antiquark and is therefore a meson. Pions are the lightest mesons and, more generally, the lightest hadrons. They are unstable, with the charged pions 
&gt; π+
&gt;  and 
&gt; π−
&gt;  decaying with a mean lifetime of 26.033 nanoseconds (2.6033×10−8 seconds), and the neutral pion 
&gt; π0
&gt;  decaying with a much shorter lifetime of 84 attoseconds (8.4×10−17 seconds). Charged pions most often decay into muons and muon neutrinos, while neutral pions generally decay into gamma rays.

What's being perpetuated by anti-vaxxers is that there's some conspiracy that our government and health institutions are in on. That it's some single entity creating this false truth.

However, the reality is that all of these people are not connected. Private medical institutions, medical researchers, academics, government agencies, biologists, any kind of person who has remotely studied this believes vaccines are essential. The people who are studying this see the science, the research is available and agree with it. 

To believe in anti-vaxxing you'd have to agree that every doctor, pharmacist, or nurse is either denying the truth, in on the conspiracy, or is being completely duped. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Think about all the schools who study medicine, all the professors, all the students, and then think of all the research facilities. None of them are coming out and supporting anti-vaxxing. NONE.

I'm sorry I used your comment for this statement because I understand where you're coming from. Yes, take all the vaccines recommended.

&gt; The senator supports charter schools in general but said he was conscious of the appearance of impropriety and avoided voting on specific virtual education matters. For instance, a bill increasing oversight over virtual charters passed last year. Holdman didn't vote on Senate Bill 567 on the floor.

Is this a good look for Holdman? Certainly not. The Senator said he was ""terribly embarrassed."" He should be. However, he also blew the whistle on himself and went to the Ethics Committee, abstained from voting on related matters, and is conscious of the appearance of impropriety. Those are actions we should be encouraging from our legislators who find themselves in similar circumstances.

By all means dig deeper into some of his other business and consulting relationships to look for similarly dubious outcomes that may indicate a pattern of conduct.

People vote Republican for various reasons but from what I have seen it is mostly because the GOP touts the values and importance of self determination. Reps view government oversite not as something to protect them, but to limit them. Not something to hold those with power to account, but a place for the selfish and greedy to pursue and further their own interests. 

And as life gets harder, Republican politicians tell Republican voters that the government and people who are poorer are to blame. Republican voters need to be shown how their elected officials are making their lives harder and blaming it on people with no power at all.

What saddens me is when the republicans use identity politics as a way to maintain power. but i wouldnt even call the GOP 'Republicans'. or atleast not the republican party i knew. Republicans were about fiscal responsibility, obviously not anymore with by far the biggest deficit the country has ever seen. I thought the republicans were about individual freedoms. yet they take away net neutrality, the president is destroying that right every single day by attacking anyone who disagrees with him. I thought republicans were about maintaining checks and balances and states rights, yet the senate eliminated THEIR SOLE RIGHT TO IMPEACH from the constitution. State prosecutors can't even escape the wrath of Trump while he lines the federal prosecutors with right-wing judges when the judicial system shouldn't have any political influence. I thought the Republican party was about free markets and less government bailouts, yet Trump throws tarriffs on everyone and spent much more bailing out agriculture than Obama did during the 08 financial crisis. and for those who thinks Trump is a Christian i dont even know what to say. I never read in the bible it was cool to have extra martial affiairs with porn stars maybe i missed that section. Trump doesnt even know the difference between the old and the new testiment, which is a testiment in and of itself.

Honestly, which one of us do you think actually talks to these people more? Of course racism isn't tolerable, and I don't tolerate it when talking to people. But most people only blame minorities because of either biases they were raised with or because the only sources of information is news telling them that people who have no power are the source of their problems and you and I both know that isn't true. Good god, getting all whipped up that all Republicans are racist hate mongers with no legitimate problems is being just as narrow minded and easily controlled as you claim them to be. Yes, racism is still a huge issue. That shit runs deep and is systemic and is propagated as a means to keep us continually divided. But on an individual level the only way to bridge that gap is to meet them at their anger and help them point it in the right direction. Not be a over generalizing narrow minded prick that validates their hate. (Now this is tricky because like I said racism isn't tolerable and I believe that some white people, many people in fact, feel less guarded and more open around people of their own race. That sucks but it is true. So as a white guy j have in roads that others may not have as quickly and that sucks.)

 But you know the old trope about racist grandpa? It's because that shit runs deep.

We can fight about women's rights over their bodies, gays rights to get married, how many immigrants to allow, but until recently there was no debate about big money donations to either party, or the fact that productivity and CEO salaries have gone up tremendously in the last 50 years or that.maybe America isn't always the good guy or that the fucking planet is cooking. That is manufactured consent. 

Are you familiar with the yellow vest movement? The government tried putting the burden of climate change on the working people and so they came together, regardless of party, and showed up and disrupted and collectively told the government to fuck off....and it worked. 

There are issues that should not and never can be compromised. Rights for the groups you listed being the forefront. But, as you know, those rights being protected don't actually make Republicans lives any worse. So meet them where issues impact both of your lives and they can be changed. Or keep painting with the broad brush and things will keep getting worse for everyone. 

Allies aren't people who hold the exact same beliefs. They are groups willing to pull on the same direction where there is the same aim.

It’s gone downhill ever since the original owners (the Spackman’s) sold it. Spackman sold it to Morgan Recreation Vacations (MRV) who has no amusement part experience. MRV made big changes that didn’t go over well with the town. Instead of working with the town they did their own thing. You used to be able to walk through the park for free. My mom loved this because she could take us kids and not have to pay to sit. My cousins talk about a taco stand that used to live in the park but that was hurt when people had to pay to walk in. I guess this taco stand was a town staple. 

The last time I was at the beach while MRV owner it the rides broke down constantly. The old pirate ship thing that became a water gun ride was shut down and just seemed to be a breeding ground for mosquitos. Very sad to see. 

MRV eventually sold it to Apex Parks Group (APG) that had experience with parks but I think the damage was done at that point for the park.

* Purdue once did all of its printing in-house, so if a department within Purdue wanted something printed, they paid the printing department. Now Purdue pays Xerox for the same service. Maybe paying a little bit less for the service, but instead of the money staying within the university, the payments now go out. So, it's a net loss to the University for the same service.

Just because Indiana doesn't have the best regulations on water doesn't mean there aren't bodies of water that are at an acceptable level to swim in. That doesn't prove your point. We're specifically talking about **one** body of water.

I've lived on the east coast and many other states and guess what is the top discussion when it comes to water protection? Farm and industrial waste. So making vague claims like ""you swim in farm waste"" just doesn't do it for me. That can be claimed anywhere. Even in the ocean where our rivers pour out of. Our beaches find farm waste when studies are done.

That's why I want facts to go with opinions. That's why we have parameters for these things. You'll find nasty stuff in any natural body of water, but to what degree?

Personnel - The schools had student-to-teacher ratios of more than 200-to-1. Similar online schools average a 30-to-1 ratio. (This should have been a huge red flag to anyone with a brain.) Many teachers were also part time rather than conventional full time employees.   

Succession - The founder of the schools, Thomas Stoughton, resigned from his role and the board in 2015 but was the head of multiple companies (AlphaCom, etc.) that the group the group paid millions of dollars to for rent and management between the school's inception and closure.

Contracts - Much of the money was embezzled through bogus contracts with companies owned by leadership. Over 89% of their funding went to ""support services"" contracts. Other virtual schools in Indiana paid about 25% of their funds toward support services. Further,  Indiana charter law requires that contracts disclose potential conflicts like the ones that set Stoughton’s company up to profit from the school’s spending. The documents that could show if the school declared the conflict of interest are missing.   

Relationship with authorizing entity - They misled and lied to the authorizing entity for months if not years. There have been suspicions about the school since at least 2017 but the Senator didn't drop them until 2019.   

Strategy - 61 out of more than 900 seniors graduated in 2016. Enough said.

Thank you for contacting my office regarding marijuana legalization. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.

Historically, rather than the federal government, state governments have been the main drivers to establish marijuana policy in their home states. Forty-six states and the District of Columbia have moved to legalize medicinal marijuana, while only ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized it for recreational use. A 2017 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that, while cannabinoid products can be an effective treatment for various medical conditions, smoking marijuana can cause respiratory disease and may have other severe health risks similar to smoking tobacco.

More federal government, however, is not the answer to every problem. The decision to allow for the use of medicinal cannabis should be left to the states. As legislators, however, we must remain mindful of the potential benefits and adverse health risks relating to general marijuana use. I appreciate your thoughts and will take them into account should this topic be brought to the Senate floor.

Thank you for contacting me. It is an honor to serve as your U.S. Senator from Indiana. Please keep in touch with me on issues of concern to you. You can also follow me on Twitter or Facebook for real-time updates on my activities in the U.S. Senate. If I ever may be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.

So if it’s coming around on the drivers side, you would turn to the left and hit the go pedal. The idea is that the trailer wants to go straight and you need to get back in front of it and use that momentum to straighten it out. Of course if it’s started to come around because the tractor drives lost traction, you handle it differently depending on traffic and weather conditions. 

The best thing in a normal vehicle pulling a trailer is to slow down and redistribute the weight in your trailer. 

But as far as severe sway from side to side, they really don’t train you for that unless you get to screw around on a skid pad with a truck and trailer (which is more fun than it sounds) because once the trailer gets around 25 degrees of deviation from the driveline at speed, you’re probably not going to save it unless you happen to be a professional stunt driver on a movie set.",1582315951,fib72wf

Representative Shackleford introduced the otherwise entirely unrelated insulin amendment, which was referred to in the article, and not added to the bill.

I agree with you that it seems like the insulin cap should be its own bill.

We're reliant on so many tiers of crap now and each one of them can raise rates or reduce coverage on a whim. Your employer can change plans/change their contribution, your insurance company can cover/not cover any medicine at any time or increase your copay (in addition to denying as many claims as possible), and the drug manufacturer can raise the prices to any amount they want to due to patent abuse.

It's a shit system. If the insurance companies could *only* charge people $100 per month copay for insulin, then they'd have to negotiate a better price with the drug maker to make up for it. If this would bankrupt an insurance company, then they would've gone bankrupt without it.

And no, I would not be better off dead without insurance companies. The whole system is garbage and if you couldn't already tell, I'm 100% in favor of medicare for all and giving the government the ability to negotiate drug prices (which they are legally prohibited from doing now - and guess which party is currently preventing legislation from being passed that would allow this).",1582344826,ficej8u

If you click on 1/27 House Action Roll Call 69 you can find the vote sheet. 

It seems like it was a floor amendment that was rejected- maybe the Insurance Committee Chairman refused to hear the amendment in the committee phase. Rep. Shackleford objected on the floor and a roll call vote was called. The committee chairman’s rejection was sustained 62-32.  I’m not sure what ruled out of order means, but possibly a germaneness issue. You could look at the legislature’s rules to find out. 

The amendment would have made huge changes to the original bill. That should be heard in a committee so relevant interest groups have the chance to make public comments (both pharma &amp; consumer advocates).

6035,xenokilla,"&gt;    South Bend is haunted by deep wounds in the city’s past while grappling with its fragile future. For more than 50 years after Studebaker closed it has struggled to determine its identity, but it is beginning to change rapidly. What type of place is South Bend to South Benders in 2020? Rustbelt city? Miniature Detroit? Or has it shaken off the cloak of failure and begun to reinvent itself? Is it a beta-city? College town? A big little town? A small big city? And what happens in the middle of this transition when the mayor of our city seeks an unlikely run for the Presidency? In what ways does it build unity but also highlight the divisions within it, complicating the story we tell of ourselves.


&gt;    We are proud to call South Bend home and excited to be part of the transition as the city confronts itself in ways it is unaccustomed to on the ground locally and in the national news. It is a unique time in our city’s history as it undergoes its most dramatic shift since the collapse of Studebaker in 1963. Living in and being from South Bend we find it to be at a turning point, still trying to find its footing. We recognized the challenge of defining the character of the city as it was thrust in the national spotlight and were motivated to capture a snapshot of this liminal moment. As an independent project, from July to December 2019, we set out to ask these questions and find honest answers from a range of voices fighting for renewal in the city. The film covers several themes related to industrial decline and rebound, race relations, small business innovation, “town-gown” divide, the LGBTQ community, and a newly flourishing arts and cultural scene. We held conversations with people around South Bend to capture how residents were experiencing its changes, embracing its new life, and confronting its enduring problems - thinking about it all as the mayor runs for president.

the main issues with this are as follows:

It was deliberately designed to hurt the clubs and shops fiscally, but the entertainers and employees are suffering and pushing into dangerous alternatives to maintain their quality of life and financial stability that this industry has provided for generations here.

Dancers have taken to traveling to cities they don’t have contacts in and to clubs they’ve never been to before to provide for themselves and their families.

It has caused people within the industry to return to street life, including pushing drugs, prostitution, and other profitable illegal activities.

The main headline ringing through in the public eye is that topless lapdances are to be outlawed and that entertainers that do have to stay 18” elevated six feet or more away from customers (many clubs’ stages have to be altered or retrofitted to accommodate this) and due to ambiguous wording, may not be able to interact with customers at all on the floor if they do so.

The outreach and advocacy on behalf of the people directly affected because of this ordinance has been minimal in hopes that it wouldn’t pass and so as to keep from suffering the losses to business and revenue that are now taking place sooner than we have.

This law was passed without an active agency to support/enforce it, and with its slow rollout (90-120 days) it is likely to continue to do damage well out of the slow season, through tax season, and into the spring and summer.

If he hadn’t pressed for this monument to be left in their memory, I have no doubt that the land would’ve been turned to another cornfield, leaving us to forget the atrocities that were committed against these people. Of course this monument doesn’t forgive these acts, but I believe it is important to never forget the cultures that were established here prior to the genocide committed by the US government. It is a chilling tale to read how these natives were rounded up against their will and forced to leave behind their homes and burial sites of their loved ones. Menominee never signed any treaty to relinquish his land. 



If you’re interested, I’d highly recommend Macdonalds book, it’s full of interesting material and paints a very colorful telling of the local history here. I’ve yet to find another historical account of Indiana that is so well detailed!",1582723219,fitl577

He would not drive me from my home and the graves of my tribe, and my children, who have gone to the Great Spirit, nor allow you to tell me your braves will take me, tied like a dog, if he knew the truth. My brother, the President is just, but he listens to the word of young chiefs who have lied; and when he knows the truth, he will leave me to my own. I have not sold my lands. I will not sell them. I have not signed any treaty, and will not sign any. I am not going to leave my lands, and I do not want to hear anything more about it.”

Thankfully I have a wife that can think through a crisis and a nurse directed her to needymeds. She enrolled me in a manufacturer's program that wiped out the deductible and even covered the full cost after I lost my job.

Lighthouse Mall in Michigan City has shopping, if that's your thing, but there's not really any unique stores. La Porte has the excellent Historical Society Museum, which is shockingly large and has a pretty big collection of neat stuff.

There's plenty of state and county parks for hiking. Interestingly, NWI is mostly wetlands/bogs and a lot of it resembles Georgia more than it does Indiana, except for the absence of alligators of course.

Honestly, though, it is best to come back in the summer.

I promise you at first you’ll be alright it’s something new, but believe me it will get old. I was born in south Bend not far from the Warsaw area. You want to stay away from that area altogether. High crime, unemployment and high cost of living. I’ve lived all over Indiana. The reason I say come to Colorado is because Indiana does not get the sun like being out West does. People in Indiana are rude, angry and always have a attitude. I know I use to be one of those people! Suffered from depression and not having the sun plays a crucial role in our mental vitality. It’s not something I just made up out of the blue I’ve lived it and the family members that are still there are living it. 
   If at all possible I beg you to rethink your move. Indiana is Not going to give you the joy longterm. If you still are moving and Colorado is out of the question than consider moving to the Fishers area. Out of all the places I’ve lived in Indiana. Fishers was the nicest. Low crime, easy commute to Indy for jobs, affordable living and open to pit bulls. Great place to raise a family. For 1300 a month you can get a nice 3 bedroom home. It’s about 300 pet deposit per animal. Some places will not rent to owners of pit bulls. I know people that had pit bulls. If it’s a huge issue you can’t get around- try making your dog a support dog. It isn’t a hard process to obtain a license. Landlords cannot discriminated on the breed of dog with that license. Surrounding cities to consider Westfield, Carmel- if you look at an Indiana map and draw a circle around the outskirts of Indy ( find Westfield and follow around in a circle) all good, decent places- Avon - stay away from Speedway east side all together. Good luck if your still going to the Warsaw area- very boring and depressing but that’s pretty much Indiana as a whole.

6643,immapikachu,"Yeah, I get what they're saying to a point. Legally it's hard to enforce especially because of how the law is currently written. However, it's not always easy to judge when a person is going to leave a roundabout, especially if it has more than one lane. That and the fact that some people have no idea what they're trying to do and so also throw a lane change in there without signaling on top of trying to exit the roundabout, it's just a mess. Some roundabouts are pretty small though so it's not always easy to signal. I just think about it as forming good habits. I always signal directly after I pass the exit before the exit I want to take. It seems to give enough time for the driver at the next exit to react. If I always signal, I never have to worry about thinking ""oh well is this roundabout even big enough for me to bother?"" I just do it no matter what.


I know that roundabouts are new here, but people really are overcomplicating them. I think we needed to have some sort of driver's education before they decided to put all these roundabouts in. I've been to Europe a couple times so I already knew what to expect (and they're taught to signal when they're entering and again when they're exiting), but sometimes around here I'm left just shaking my head at what some people do when they encounter a roundabout.

The only states I can even think of anymore that give us a ran for our money are Mississippi and Idaho. 

It's an absolute travesty that this type of shit fails in Indiana, Marijuana reform of any sort won't even get a hearing, and they refuse to give teachers raises.  Meanwhile, states which 10 years ago would have easily been considered more behind-the-times than Indiana - Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, etc - have all enacted medical marijuana laws, and for fucks sake even Kentucky just voted resoundingly in favor of MMJ in the House, even if it stands no chance in their Senate.

Warren on the other hand is just a generic hand dancing to the strings of the DNC. She's been pretty close to major party leadership even before the elections, flipped on Sanders in 2016 and put herself at odds with him now, more or less filling the role Clinton had as the golden goose and more or less salting the grounds between them in the case either gets picked. Apart from that though I'm also largely biased against her for her positions on the Electoral College, Senate term limits, and slavery reparations. A lot of stupid takes which basically fall into generic progressive big tent ideology/populism, which falls into line with quite a few other candidates. Which also isn't what we need as a country.

If one likes hiking in the mountains, checking out waterfalls, boating on large lakes, Indiana isn't the best place to be for that.  The usual stuff people rave about, at least in the Indy area, are pro-sports, places to eat, and places to drink local beer.  All the outdoor stuff is very low tier.

I actually like the Las Vegas area, mostly because of the various outdoor activities within a reasonable drive from that city.  Indiana has nothing like that.  It is a six hour drive to any real mountainous area.  The Red River Gorge is decent for wilderness, but it can be hours of driving for those who live in the northern part of the state.",1583235419,fjcsxyh
6787,MyIndianaLife,"Most places have four seasons, but the problem with Indiana is that two of the seasons can make outdoor activities unbearable.  Part of that is because during the summers where temps and humidity are pretty oppressive, there is really no elevated mountain range nearby to escape to.  You can just drive a couple of hours and get 20 degrees cooler with less humidity.  There are places in the country where you can do just that.  Also, winters, especially up in N. Indiana, can be just too cold, and sometimes too snowy, to really enjoy outdoor activities.  One really has to be in the mood for arctic like temps during certain years.",1583235659,fjct5eh
6788,MyIndianaLife,"Appliance repair should be easy to find, but living in an area like Warsaw, I could see two issues.  First, any company you work for might have to service a wider area to bring in the customer base.  This means lots of driving on your part.  Second, lots area to cover means the company has a higher fuel charge and vehicle wear and tear.  Will they pass all that cost onto the customers or some on the customers and some on the employees in terms of lower wages/benefits?  I'd try to find a company and call to see what they are paying first.

Lots of smaller Indiana communities have suffered due to manufacturing losses.  Real estate prices won't come down until the very last bulk of the UAW retirees pass away or are forced to move away for medical reasons.  Many can't fathom selling their home for tens of thousands of dollars less than what they think it is worth.  There is a disconnect because these folks make $30K+/year in a pension alone, then throw in SS and the household income is $50K+/year.  All the while, the replacement warehousing and retail jobs are paying very low wages to most of the employees, not providing the lucrative retirement benefits of the past, etc..  There are also a lot of cultural changes over the decades that have pushed many of these areas to a lower economic rung on the ladder.

6878,lotusbloom74,"They are not really artificial drains necessarily, they are just regulated drains. Which is something that counties can turn most stream channels into if they so choose without the state being able to have much input. I recently met with landowners who live adjacent to Sloan Branch in Bartholomew County, which is being [turned into a regulated drain] (https://www.localnewsdigital.com/2019/09/04/columbus-city-council-designates-sloane-branch-as-regulated-drain/) despite their [opposition] (https://dickeyseasonalfarm.com) in an effort to relieve flooding for a new neighborhood upstream. It’s not just man-made ditches, although many stream channels have been essentially created artificially at this point after so much manipulation. It has nothing to do with dumping pollution (although the author/s apparently want IDEM to control water quality even more despite cutting funding and regulatory authority to them), it’s about the regulation of wetlands - which didn’t seem to be an issue previously. This, paired with the Trump Administration reversal of the Waters of the US rule just muddies the waters, so to speak, for IDEM and the US Army Corps permitting authorities. The DNR does not seem to be impacted by changes at this point related to their permitting programs (Flood Control Act, Lake Preservation Act, among several others). It will all be held up in litigation in the meantime but the end result/intention is less oversight and protection of natural resources. Whether you think that’s a good thing is your opinion, but it is not a positive thing in the view of people who work in this field. In my experience they aren’t trying to burden property owners unnecessarily, but perhaps in some instances what is technically a wetland is relatively minor and unimportant in the scheme of things. I think there can be a good middle ground, but Indiana’s environmental agencies are already so underfunded that removing more of their power really handcuffs their ability to do what their mission sets out to do.",1583369645,fjiki07

...yes, because it's the difference between ""woman retaliated against by racist coworkers"" and ""The faceless corporate machine doesn't like that the police were called."" She's suing to get her job back, and if the facts of the case are as she presents them, probably will. She was fired for missing a shift. [Asking the rude customer to leave was what began the chain of confrontations with the bartender who had been chatting with the rude customers:](https://oklahoman.com/article/5653219/former-applebees-employee-says-she-was-fired-for-booting-customer-who-made-anti-muslim-comments-files-lawsuit)

&gt; Breaud claims  management denied her request and continued to schedule her for shifts  in Middletown. Breaud was ""unable to tolerate even a single day more in  the the hostile work environment"" at the restaurant and refused the  schedule, the complaint states.
&gt; 
&gt; Then on May 20, exactly one week after the incident at the bar, the general  manager accused her of missing a shift and she was fired. Breaud claims  the accusation was ""false and retaliatory.""

This is basically the exact kind of thing the justice system is designed to sort out. Applebees falls on the side of 'If she's telling the truth, then she did nothing wrong in accordance with our policies':

&gt; ""We pride ourselves on being an active partner of each community that we  serve and are proud to operate inclusive restaurants where all are  welcome,"" Brian M. Lowe, a spokesperson for Doherty, said in a  statement. He declined to comment further, citing pending litigation.

What about when the next one comes along- is another police report really worth it? That's going to point to the person in charge and make them a target.

The police were never called in your example; the anti-Muslim customer left peacefully. The bartender who had been serving customer started complaining.

Probably a good thing they are clarifying it. The requirement is that he has a license, which he still would even when it's suspended, but when suspended he can't practice law, so does he still functionally have a license? Is performing his job as AG, which requires a law license, practicing law when there is no direct client, or is it more akin to something like teaching law or being a legal researcher? This is the kind of case that could easily go to the US Supreme Court, which as much as I want the country to see what kind of shit bag AG Hill is (and I'm from Elkhart, so I've known he was an asshole for years), I also don't want the state to have that kind of embarrassment play out on the national stage.

No, not for the prestige, the incredibly well established academics that lecture there, the research opportunities, or the network of connections that come with being an alumni. Yes, it’s all just a scheme to pay big bucks for an A. /s.  

In all my courses I have experienced exactly two that even grade on a curve. Every single other class has outlined immediately at the start that this is the cut off for an A (usually between a 90-95 depending on the course) , it will not change. Everyone could get A’s, or no one could. Work for the grade, you get the grade, regardless of the performance of your peers, better or otherwise. If that’s defined as easier, than alright I guess, but I’d define it as fair. 

In regards to price, I challenge you to find anyone who pays the actual sticker price at an Ivy, because I know absolutely zero. I’m sure they exist, but every one of my peers who I’ve spoken to has some combination of financial aid and scholarships that drop it SIGNIFICANTLY. Like I said, I literally pay less than I would at Purdue. 

And I have no qualms with Purdue as a school. Most of my friends from high school went there, and it has a great engineering and veterinary program. But to put it on the same level, or above, Ivy League institutions or pseudo Ivy schools like MIT, Cornell, etc seems strange at best. I think if I called up any number of my classmates and asked them if they thought Purdue was the pinnacle of academics, memes and jokes aside, they’d agree no, it was not. A good school? Certainly.

&gt;Following our scheduled spring break (March 15 to 22), students on all IU campuses will be taught remotely (not in person) for two weeks (March 23 to April 5). We are planning to resume face-to-face teaching on Monday, April 6. However, that could change with the evolving situation.

&gt;Students are encouraged to travel home, if possible, during this time period. For this two weeks, course work will continue via virtual online teaching. We are investigating how to accommodate classroom activities that typically include laboratories or other in-person interactions, and specific guidance will follow. IU campuses will not close, and residential halls and dining will remain open. 

&gt;While completing classes virtually, students are strongly encouraged to stay in their permanent homes away from campus, unless they are prevented from returning home because of travel restrictions or they do not have access to the technology at home, such as reliable internet access, to complete their classes remotely.

Let's listen to the experts.

------------------------------------------------------
**TL:DL (courtesy of another redditor)**

Points on Coronavirus:

Just the beginning of virus, it will be 10-15 times worse than flu.

Based on the data so far estimate there will be 48million hospitalisations, 96million cases, over 480,000 deaths in America

Will last atleast 3-6months.

Smoking, obesity and high blood pressure increase risk.

Number of cases seem to double every four days.

In the first hours of contracting there are incredibly high levels of the virus making you infectious before any symptoms show.

Kids are not getting sick from it. In China only 2% under the age of 18.

30% of nurses in America have kids(Whose going to look after them if they close schools), One quarter of Americans don’t have sick leave.

690,000 Americans have end stage renal disease get their drugs from China. Most of the drugs come from China.

No evidence this is a bioweapon.

No evidence Virus is seasonal.

Influenza transmission is like “trying to stop the wind”, isolation won’t stop it, only a vaccine.

No data anything can fight the virus besides factors that improve your immune system (exercise,good sleep, not missing medication)

Hand sanitizer is good for stopping a lot of infectious diseases but weak evidence that this virus will be transmitted that way(through hands,face) but should still use it. People want to feel like they’re doing something by washing their hands, the data says it is transmitted by breathing.

Surgical mask not effective at all from stopping virus from getting in. They were made for stopping bugs going out. N95 respirator mask are very effective.

Over 4,000 health workers in China infected. We have to protect our health workers, they are on the front line who cannot be replaced.

There might have been a vaccine for coronavirus if after SARS and MERS in 2003 everyone continued to find a vaccine but after it went away nobody had interest.

He did a Briefing with over 400 major financial investors around the world they reminded him of a scared child, he’s worried for the market, no plans in place again for this virus.

Have to prioritise a vaccine.

He predicted in his book that a virus would come out of China because of the large population and food supply that is largely wild life that comes into the markets, close contact with the animals, bugs on animals. China has been a “bacterial and viral soup vessel for a long time”

A vaccine will most likely take years, there was an antibody dependent enhancement component to SARS (A little bit of the antibody actually made you more sick)",1584028820,fkb9koe

7885,say592,"&gt; My friend told me she was refused a COVID19 test despite the fact she exhibited 4/5 symptoms, only missing the fever. 

Keep in mind that the symptoms are very similar to other respiratory illnesses, and the fever is a pretty key component. From what I have heard, as of the start of the week the state only had 100 or so testing kits. Private facilities are getting them now too, but the testing capacity in general is very low for the time being.

7895,The_One_X,"&gt; N95 respirator mask are very effective. 

DO NOT buy N95 masks, there is/will be a shortage of masks. We need to save these for medical professionals. It is more important that those treating COVID do not get sick from it than any other person. As well N95 masks can only be worn for a short period of time (restricts too much air flow), and are single use items. As soon as you take it off it will no longer be effective.

Instead, buy a reusable surgical mask, and wear that. No it will not prevent you from getting the disease, but it will help to prevent you from spreading the disease if you do catch it. That is more important. If enough people wear these masks it will be as effective as you individually wearing an N95 mask.",1584032066,fkbfio5

We know there is varying concern as to how we continue to live and operate in the midst of the world pandemic, as well as maintain a sense of normalcy. A few things I'd like to share with you...
&gt; 
&gt; As of today, all weekend services and environments are on as scheduled. Our leadership team will continue to assess and be thoughtful as we consider ongoing services and environments, in light of this rapidly changing landscape with the COVID-19 Coronavirus. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our building management and facilities team has been taking extra measures in expanding cleaning protocols for all surfaces, kids environments, and common spaces.  We have always used hospital grade disinfectants, and have expanded that coverage with additional EPA approved disinfectants for COVID-19 Coronavirus this week.   
&gt; 
&gt; Last, we invite you to join us in intently praying for the heath and souls of all the people of the world. For wisdom and insight for our medical and research communities that are actively combating and tirelessly working to eradicate this virus and develop vaccines. We are also praying for those who have been affected by this virus.

This seems false given the experience of China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent South Korea, all of which have significantly slowed the virus through social isolation.

7904,echelon37,"Doesn't help. I have been in Seattle twice in the past month, as well as some other high infection areas, I travel a lot for work. Both my young son and I came down with a cough and low grade fever, called ahead and asked to come in, my doc said don't worry about it and tried to schedule out weeks from now, his doc said come on in.

When we got there, they put us in masks and seemed kind of freaked out, but still had us wait in the waiting room. Met with the Dr who said she couldn't test me or my son for any reason because I haven't been out of the country, and couldn't test me even if she wanted because they state wouldn't allow it and they have to approve it and she said she was told unless it was obvious to not even send in a request. 

She tested us for flu, which was negative, then we were sent home and said call if it gets hard to breath.

Do I think I have Coronavirus? No, Probably not, but I do fit the risk profile, and have symptoms as does my young son (we both got sick at same time).

Yes but this isn't a public hearing. This is public testimony... That is completely different.  Public testimony is one person not in the general assembly bringing up testimony (a case) to the general assembly for their consideration.

Public testimony is usually done by lobbyist or different activist leaders, which I think this guy said he is part of some education group.

A Public hearing would be a town hall type environment where multiple people get to provide their input and it happens extremely early in the legislative process...not 2 days before the bill is signed.

A public hearing is an event where the purpose is to hear the views and opinions of the public..public testimony is simply any citizen giving a specific testimony on a specific issue.

This was not a public hearing and like I said earlier (which you tried to dismiss as semantics), a public hearing is not the same as public testimony.

2) While most rank and file members may choose their party uncritically, there is absolutely no reason to expect a candidate to do so. Rather, I assume that my dog catcher candidate from my earlier comment made a deliberate choice to wear the party standard if he chose to run as the Republican Dog Catcher.

However, I would like to point out that IN General Assembly has been passing the buck down to the local level for many years, and that's what affords them this aura of fiscal responsibility.

The ""useless bureaucrats"" that you reference are in place, in large part, due to the compliance requirements handed down by the very same legislators that you believe to be protecting our public interest.

In actual fact, the General Assembly has been infiltrated by out-of-state interests who have very little regard for the education of our young people.  Instead, these interests have bought their way into our legislature through a multi-pronged strategy. 

It has been their continued argument that public schools are ""top heavy"" and beholden to state teacher unions. This has been the argument promulgated by any number of school privatization special interest groups who aren't interested in furthering IN public education so much as they are interested in constructing an investment vehicle for out-of-state intersts.  

In fact, the more the IN General Asssembly burdens local school districts with PAC-sponsored mandates that more ""bureaucrats"" they have to direct toward satisfying them. 

In fact, public schools suffer because the IN General Assembly has pushed the burden onto local entities to maintain the low tax policies on the state level.

With regard to ""gravy"" and ""fat-cat"" type contracts, I can tell you from 20 years of personal experience that Indiana has the absolute highest integrity when it comes to awarding public construction contracts.  There is no ""gravy"" in building new facilities, because the costs are the actual costs.

8228,gaarscott,"Thank you for the informative reply.

Charter schools need ""IN tax dollars"" for the same reason that public schools do:  the parents are paying taxes for their kid's education and the school pays its bills from tax revenue.  I thought that charter schools got a part of the revenue proportional to their enrollment.  Indeed, your argument about them ""siphoning"" money away implies it.

I have my doubts about Indiana State contracting in general.  Why is I-65 still under repair?  More particularly, there is no need for new school construction, so any money spent (however well) on it is graft.  The architect was paid eighty thousand dollars for planning the new Medora school, which was not needed, required the demolition of the historic old school, and has been having expensive HVAC problems and roof leaks ever since.  Under a one-year warranty, of course.

I agree that ridiculous compliance regulations are responsible for a considerable waste of school money.  However, there's still a lot of paper-shuffling and assistant-to jobs that private schools do perfectly well without.

Again, there's plenty of money under the ""circuit-breaker"" limits.  What we have is the old Tammany Switcheroo, where all sorts of extraneous expenses are put on the school budget, which falls short, and then the politicans ask for a referendum to get more money ""for education"".

I certainly don't belive that State legislators are ""protecting our public interest"".  I know too much Indiana history for that.  If the ""out-of-state interests"" can provide better schools while constructing an investment vehicle, I'm all for them.",1584145648,fkfymme

8290,Yella69,"Indiana State Prison in Michigan City IN. I'm a correctional officer in the largest cellhouse in the entire USA. There are roughly 400 prisoners to roughly 4 of us guards at most times in the building. The inmates are not treated well. But they also act like assholes since it's a level 4 max security and they really have nothing to lose. Most of the officers who have been there for a year + have told me they've been assaulted at some point unless they are female. 

Our prison is the opposite of a place for reform. They get all the drugs, booze and anything else they can afford to pay for. No one at my prison is benefiting from it from what I can see. When I was at a level 2 prison for 2 weeks during my training it seemed a lot better as far as potentially having a positive impact on their lives. In the level 2 those were people facing roughly 5-10 years as opposed to 25+ so they were much better behaved because getting a year or two added for being a dipshit actually matters to them. The hardest thing about being a CO is that EVERYONE tries to lie and con you when they know you're knew. My first week 1 out of every 2 inmates promised me they had a job and should be left unlocked. When in reality it's like 20 people in the entire cellhouse. They are really really convincing liars to. Hollywood should talent scout at prisons for actors.",1584201351,fkhlhpc

8330,raghanmae,"I worked for the IN BMV for three years and went to the prisons to issue IDs for inmates being released within a year. 2 times to ISP and once to Westville. 

Backstory: Mobile Branch visits are voluntary. I had always wanted to go (morbid curiosity) but my first manager rarely let her girls go because she’s extremely racist and also judged us based on whether she thought we could handle it. I’m female, 5’2,” 160 pounds, tattooed and wear short hair and resting bitch face very well (this comes into play later.) She didn’t seem to think I was equipped so I got denied often. She retired and a new manager came in who recognized it was just something which had to be done so she let us volunteer. I had met the mobile branch manager while working at the Indiana State Fair and we hit it off so he picked me when I volunteered pretty much every time. 

What triggered me responding to your comment: how people coming in are treated like criminals more than the criminals already in there. My first time to ISP had us set up in the cafeteria/kitchen? (You would know layout better than me.) So we had to park around back while the manager brought the equipment in. We were told to bring our lunches in clear containers, no cell phones, medications in labeled containers, no pre-opened water/pop bottles, but nothing about what to wear because we are expected to show in uniform despite no real customers/management laying eyes on us all day. I wore a BMV polo and fleeced lined pants. When I got to security, something (likely a hidden security tag from the store) in the lining of my pants on the bottom right leg was sending your wands off. They were making such a big deal about it I volunteered to rip the lining open so they could see. Ol’ girl finally stopped giving me a hard time about it after deciding it was just a hidden tag. We set up and they brought I think 3 or 4 rounds of guys in throughout the day. 

Remember how good I am at resting bitch face? I plastered it on, not knowing what I’d be dealing with. Turns out, it was completely unnecessary. It was “yes ma’am, no ma’am, thank you ma’am, have a good/blessed day” etc all day. I know they are getting out soon and don’t want to ruin their chances but I still expected a little bit of foolery because why not? We are a break from the same incarcerated/CO faces they see all day. There was none. Midday we hit lunch time for them so they got their meals in to-go containers and the CO guy overseeing them just looked like a douchebag, talking to them like garbage, you could tell he was a dick. I asked one of the guys, “that guy’s a whole asshole ain’t he?” He laughed to himself and said, “shit you don’t know how right you are.”

Next time I was called up we went through the front of the prison, into the walls, and upstairs like 4 floors to some room used for adult classes. Entering the front and going through the locked sections felt like something out of a movie. You weren’t kidding when you said how old it is. It was mediaeval, almost. We got to the room and it was hotter than fuck up there. This is when they had brought some more serious offenders who were close to being done. It was hurry up and wait *all day* because they had to bring them in in separate groups. I’m told this is because certain guys like snitches etc couldn’t be walked passed general population due to harassment they’d endure. One dude was brought in singularly in a wheelchair because he’d been fucked up for rolling on some guys in there. It was rough to see. Over all though, it was the same story: extreme politeness, brevity, happiness to be getting out soon. There was a guy in that room who, as I understand it, kind of gets to hang out there. He made us coffee and when I declined he asked me why. In addition to it being 500° up there, I said I don’t like black coffee (thinking it was my only option.) He goes, “oh nah girl, I’ll be right back.” He went to his cell/wherever he keeps this stuff and brought me back his personal cream and sugar and all but begged me to have some. Apprehensive about it potentially having drugs/some other unsafe thing in it (lol I’m naive, what can I say) I gave in; it was the best cup of coffee I’d had in ages. This is shameful on my behalf but there was even a guy in one of these groups who was, top ten, one of the hottest guys I’ve ever laid eyes on. It really makes you wonder what the hell goes wrong in their lives to land up here. 

Westville was a shitshow, I’d pick ISP any day. They set us up in a hallway leading to an auditorium. We were basically outside. We did an absolute shitload of IDs that day. The only problem person I dealt with was a white, hillbilly older guy who didn’t understand why he was getting only an ID, his lawyer had promised him a full driver’s license when he got out and he was extremely concerned with his prior motorcycle endorsement. I could see that he would have to go through all the testing all over again to have one due to amount of year lapsed, but I couldn’t tell him that. We are specially instructed to give no further information outside of when the ID will arrive to the prison and that the plastic will be in their release packet. I informed this guy of this and he was getting visibly upset. He kept asking me about it and telling me what his lawyer promised. Some big, burly black guy who’s in charge around there had to be called over to quell the situation. The guys on our team stopped what they were doing and huddled around me, all eyes on him. Otherwise out of 170 guys, no issues. 

I know this was long but your comments about the guys, getting away with shit in there, the conditions etc all made me think of my limited interactions with the offenders and the places. I hope you do okay with it if you like it. For some perspective, being a state employee through the BMV is much the same way in unnecessary and wasted training. They waste a lot of time for high turnover and it doesn’t matter because it’s all budgeted for. My only recommendation is that if you leave, do so the “right way” and remain hirable with the state so you can go to other agencies if you want. Best of luck to you.",1584210307,fki1y3y

At one point I calculated they were paying us roughly $70k at minimum during a 2 week period of training at another facility.

prison stories can be hard to get picked up because especially around here, papers aren't into stepping onto law enforcement's toes. but especially since you're framing it as wasteful public expenditure, if you get the attention of a local media outlet on a slow news day (and there's only so much panicking about Coronavirus the media can do per day, right?)

The more I thought about this the more upset I got as she was touching all of the chips and money handing to each of us.  

&amp;#x200B;

I said ""no, really if you are sick you shouldn't be here"" and she got all indignant saying that she was just joking.  The person who sits at the craps table (I'm not sure of their title but they run the game) told her that this was not something to joke about.

&amp;#x200B;

Again I was getting agitated because she did not look well and she had to ask for the pit boss to cover her for a few minutes while she ran to the bathroom (I've never actually seen this done before).  

&amp;#x200B;

The old guy standing next to me (to which there were probably 3 guys in their mid to late 70's at least) said that she was here yesterday and was sick as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I left the table and went to the pit boss/floor supervisor and said ""look you have a dealer over here who is obviously sick and she is handling all of the chips and money and dealing with several elderly people"".  He told me that they were aware of it and that he had contacted the shift supervisor to get her sent home.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still pretty pissed because I was supposed to see my Mother today who is herself in her mid 70's and honestly I don't know what I've been exposed to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really pissed at the person who came to work sick and acted like I was the asshole when I was pointing it out.  I'm also upset at the person working the table because she wouldn't listen to us and only said that the dealer said she was kidding.

Now that people can create value out of information rather than material goods, a small business should be categorized out of revenue, not employee number.

the downside is that other germs can take advantage of your suppressed immune system and cause other issues.

[They have over 100,000 more military personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy#National) than the [US armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces).

Pretending that the US Military is a White Knight in shiny armor protecting the world from an imaginary axis of evil is literal propaganda you've been brainwashed with.

&gt;Those programs can only exists in the shadow of the stability we provide

Jesus christ, you are proof propaganda works. You genuinely think that the US is single handedly preventing someone from invading Europe, don't you?

&gt;Look at the huge NAFTA imbalance that's been there for decades

[From the University of Pennsylvania](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/naftas-impact-u-s-economy-facts/):

"" For all that, most studies conclude that NAFTA has had only a modest  positive impact on U.S. GDP. For example, according to a 2014 report by  the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), t**he United  States has been $127 billion richer each year thanks to “extra” trade  growth fostered by NAFTA**. ""

So yes, those huge """"""imbalances"""""" have added $127 billion to the US economy every year. Wow, what a huge issue for the US, gaining $127 BILLION a year in trade revenue.

Inb4 ""MaNuFaCTErInG wEnT DoWN!11!"". Well, that's free-market capitalism for you. Weird how people are all about that free market capitalism until it helps brown people out more than it helped white people out 🤔. It's almost like the US work force has gotten more educated and people working in Manufacturing should educated themselves rather than bitch and moan that Mexican 'took der jerbs'.

&gt;If the financial incentives cease to exist we don't get new  revolutionary drugs as often as we do and they don't exist without the  American market

You're literally just dead wrong here. [Europe has a higher rate of drug discovery than America.](https://pnhp.org/news/europe-leads-in-pharmaceutical-research/) And Canada, a country with socialize medication, [just announced they're entering trial stages for a Corona virus vaccine](https://nypost.com/2020/03/13/canadian-scientists-make-breakthrough-in-coronavirus-vaccine-effort/) while the US scratches it's nuts and refuses to test people.

He's doing the bare minimum: providing an average wage. Woah, what a nice guy. His employees aren't getting $45/hr, he's SPENDING $45 an hour on them. Average union construction worker only makes [$28 an hour](https://www.liuna.org/liuna-difference) which puts them at roughly the median for wages in America. Providing people with the average isn't exactly good. It's expected, especially for something as labor intensive as construction. A business is nothing without employees, people in America have been brainwashed to think differently. 

&gt; This guy is doing good. If he folds due to prohibitive costs, while  you're sitting pretty armchair quarterbacking, all his workers will be  out of jobs 

You think unionized construction workers would be out of a job? Damn, you're high as a kite. They'd be fine. I really don't care if a business owner went out of business: that's the nature of capitalism for you. If you can't provide fair wages, you don't deserve the employees. Period.

Ebola - It’s pretty difficult to catch Ebola and it doesn’t spread the same way Coronavirus does.  Even though it has a high death rate, not many people caught it due to this. Thankfully this also got contained. 

Zika - not even similar at all 

Bird flu, swine flu, H1N1 - what you’re referring to as H1N1 you probably are referring to the swine flu pandemic in 2009 which really shows how much you know by listing them separately. But the flu is different than coronavirus for many reasons: it has a low death rate ( about 0.1%), it’s epidemic to the whole world and has been for a long time, hospitals are generally equipped for flu season, and there is a seasonal vaccine

Compare that to coronavirus: 2-4% death rate, completely new so nobody has immunity, hospitals cannot handle the load of extra patients, and there is no vaccine. Also, it’s not contained and we’ve missed our opportunity to contain it.",1584370757,fknovve

Before the cash infusion, they are reluctant to loan. This means a small business owner can get a loan to float the business through a down period. So, they don't have to close, but do have to pay back their loan. Also, rates are low since the Fed set the interest rates pretty low at the moment. Paying back the money sucks, but it's better than closing shop permanently. 

Yes, it would be better to get a straight up relief check without the need to pay it back, but this way the market stabilizes and businesses stay open (provided they are able to get a loan to stay open, an assumption on my part).",1584383607,fkob01n

8965,bandeeznuts,"Like other guy said, file for unemployment. I’d be incredibly surprised if you didn’t qualify 

Isn’t that considered working for the state? If you call 1-800-891-6499 and follow the prompts to speak with someone. They’re all very helpful and understanding (I’m pretty sure that’s the correct number. They have a few different phone numbers, but at the very least they’ll be able to point you in the right direction) you could also go to a work one office, but has to be a full service office. When I was on unemployment I filled online at a work one office, but they were NOT full service, meaning if I had questions about filing my claim the people there are NOT aloud to answer any questions, then give you a phone number to connect to someone who can help you and they answer very quick too

There is a general negative opinion with unemployment, seriously screw that noise. What we have left of Unemployment benefits are super important. Years ago they used to give you a large portion of what you used to make (think it was 80%) and there could be on it for years if the work market isn’t biting. NOW the benefit amount is minimum 50$ a week and up to 350$ a week, OR 47% of your weekly pay. But if you made over 1000$ a week, then maximum you can get is 350$ a week

The mind set of unemployment is “leech to society” “freeloading off the government” and “if you don’t work you don’t get money”. But in reality your company pays insurance for situations like this, if a pandemic arises like now, or if your terminated without cause, or your job shuts down and you can’t find another job at the drop of a hat (because who the hell can find a new job within a few days or even weeks of being out of the job???) then your employers INSURANCE COMPANY is the one paying you, the government ONLY regulates it to make sure people are trying to find work and not abuse the system. Cause it happens, but people blow that way out of proportion, that is not *that* common especially given the minuscule amount they pay you while inbetween jobs

Absolutely max you can claim unemployment benefits for 28 weeks, EXCEPT for right now there is an emergency extension in place so people are aloud to get extensions if they’ve been on unemployment for over 28 weeks (which obviously doesn’t matter to you, but a fun fact I guess lol)",1584389650,fkolljm

8983,bandeeznuts,"Np, but with that being said. Some employers are reeeaaally big A-holes when it comes to giving suggestions towards Unemployment benefits. Since it’s a public school and government funded I highly doubt they’d steer you away from it, but when it comes to jobs like I’ve had (very small family owned businesses that are super greedy) they’ll act like it’s the end of the world, because while they don’t pay you directly for the unemployment benefits, their insurance rates go up because the company paying them 

Idk the specifics on that side of unemployment benefits, but I’ve had a few places be super big drama queens when it comes to rightfully firing people because they are *scared to death* of having their rates of payment be increased because the insurance company had to pay out unemployment benefits 

But like I said, I doubt you’d run into that issue cause it’s basically ran by government and they have to keep that level of professionalism, but do keep in mind that that who your asking advice to may be against you filing an unemployment claim because it does cost them some amount of money when people actually use it

So yeah, in short, basically the system is wack lol but given the circumstances, it would be very disgusting on their part to try to persuade you into not filing, just because they have to pay a little more money every month.

9039,JeremyRhodes1yahooco,"I am afraid I don’t see your point! 
When I was in that situation I didn’t give a crap about toilet paper at all! 

The fact is people who are not in that situation still have needs and I was trying to help them. 

Someone who is in that situation will not care about anything else they are consumed with the health of their family.

I know because 2 years ago my newborn daughter spent 2 months in intensive care and wasn’t expected to survive! 
Only a miracle from God himself is why my daughter is alive!! 

During those 2 months aliens could have landed in Times Square and I would not have cared, all I cared about was my families safety, well being and health. 

Remember we never posted the toilet paper for sale at all, it was to be given away for free from the beginning and you would have known that if the original poster opened the article then took a screen shot. 
I assume they didn’t because they were intentionally trying to make this look like something it wasn’t! 
Probably the same reason they didn’t actually wipe out my name or company logo! 

When people who didn’t need a car came by and told us they needed the toilet paper we gave it to them for free anyway. 
Even tho the original promotion was for people who referred a car buyer to us or bought a car from us. 
We still gave it to the first 5 people that asked about it. 

The fact is we had extra toilet paper at a time when people needed toilet paper so we decided to give it away for free! 
I never thought that could be considered a bad thing! 

I still don’t see how it is a bad thing, however I do see how it looked bad as people who do not know me, also do not know where I got it! 

Let’s play another thought experiment! 
This time put yourself in my shoes! 

Let’s not forget I am a car dealer this is normally my busiest time of year. 
But with this virus no one is buying cars from anyone. All the dealers I know are panicking!

I am a very small car lot we can only have a maximum of 10 cars at a time. 
60% of my income for the YEAR normally comes between feb 15th and April 15th. 

This is my only income for my family of 6 as my wife is a stay at home mom and her extreme coupon addiction is non-profit meaning anything we don’t store for us we donate to people or give to the church for free!! 

We have only sold 1 car this month and run a real risk of losing our house and business. 

I know people still need cars they are just focused on other priorities at the moment. 
I was trying to get a handful of people to consider getting a car now because quite frankly if I don’t sell a couple by the end of the month MY family will be homeless or at very least we will miss the mortgage payment. At both the dealership and my house! 

Instead of doing what other business owners do and hoarding my profits. We give away cars, groceries and just about anything else people need. 

In the last year we bought over a months worth of groceries for 2 separate families in need! 

Just a few months ago we bought 150 Kids in foster care their own backpack because I found out everything they owned was being transported in trash bags. So we bought them backpacks so they could feel a little better about themselves. 

On December 25th we gave away a car worth $2,500 to a single father who’s wife passed away December 16th. He had no car to go to work to take care of his kids, so we gave him one for free!

On December 28th we gave another car worth $2,500 to a mother who also had a job but had to walk to work because she didn’t have a car. 

Just last month an elderly ladys’ van broke down in the middle of the road, we stopped what we were doing to pick up her and all her groceries she just bought and give her a ride home. Then we helped her arrange a tow truck to take it to shop, and no we didn’t sell her the van, and No we didn’t ask her to use our shop or benefit us in anyway. We just saw her broke down in the middle of the road and did the right thing because that’s what we do! 

3 days ago a mother couldn’t find formula for her baby girl, I got in my truck and drove around until I found a store with the formula bought it and dropped it off at her door, I literally rang the door bell hopped in my truck and took off! You should have seen her face when she picked up the bag and saw what it was! 

Just yesterday a lady couldn’t find wipes for her baby. I called a store owner friend that had some and had them place 2 packs behind the register on hold until she could get there. 

Anytime I see a need in my community if I can help I do. 

However, I am extremely concerned that by next month I will be the one that needs help!! 

Our emergency fund was spent getting us thru my daughters’ time in the hospital. What little we had put back got spent getting us thru the last month with almost no sales. 

So pretend that it is your family on the brink of losing all that you have. 
You see both a chance to do something good and also attract attention for your car dealership.

That’s what I was doing, trying to stay in business while also helping others with something I already had plenty of. 

If this virus doesn’t stop soon it won’t matter anyway I will be bankrupt. 
But if you do come to my town just ask anyone about me. I am well know around here as the person to go to for help. 
If I can’t help directly I find someone who can! 

 I understand we are all scared, and this is how some people deal with being scared they attack and tear down others. 
When I am scared I help others it’s how I deal with anxiety.",1584405436,fkpadh1

You're clearly not stupid. You know why people are (misguided as they may be) hoarding toilet paper.

Yet you decided to make a joke about a disease that is literally killing people.

Again double check everything in the thread here! 
Heck check the thread your commenting on! 

I never made this into a joke quite the opposite as I said in the screenshot you can see that I was serious. 

As you’ve read in the comment I said i was sorry, it was just, it was a misguided attempt to help if that’s not an apology you tell me what it is? 

When I first posted that I was giving away the toilet paper it got a lot of laughing emojis so I changed the heading to say you thought I was joking but I am serious. 

I never made this a joke! 

Your clearly the one who is mistaken here and like I said some people deal with being scared by taking their frustration out on others that is clearly who you are, and that’s ok God made each and every one of us different! 
Even though you are quite literally telling me your trying to bankrupt me I still hold no ill will toward you!

Your opening line should have been, ""I'm sorry, this was in poor taste,"" not paragraph after paragraph of you trying to defend yourself for being such a stand up guy.

Tbh, the tests administered around the world are all different in identifying CV, but the problem is most definitely not money.

&gt;Regular folks should realize that an economists input should be taken on the economy.  Otherwise we get trickle-down economic policy from our legislators.


&gt;That a doctor's view should be referenced on medical matters.  Otherwise we get anti-vaxxers and essential oils.

Have you not seen Dr. Anthony Facui, one of the nations top infectious diease experts, at every fucking press conference?

Have you even watched a Trump coronavirus update outside his oval office address? It's basically him talking for 5 minutes and immediately turning it over to Dr. fauci and other experts lol.

That says Germany and the CDC got their protocols on the same day.  Remember, in January, the American media / public was more worried about the impeachment and Kobe's death than they were a few people in China getting a new flu / cold.

Anyways, my guess is it may have something to do with the pride of the people at the CDC and the red tape the FDA puts up for approving tests.  And just general American hard headedness.  Like these sections:

&gt; On February 29th, the same day that the F.D.A. first approved the New York tests, the agency also issued a new policy guidance that allowed any facility that had been certified to handle so-called high-complexity testing to run its own COVID-19 tests. According to Becker, about five thousand virology labs in the country, including the one at the University of Washington, met the criterion. For the first time since February 4th, Keith Jerome and his colleagues were allowed to conduct clinical COVID-19 tests. “That changed everything,” Jerome said. “We didn’t have to wait to get the forms in and then wait for the response.”

&gt; As for the delay in scaling up COVID-19 testing capacity during those crucial weeks in February, Jerome told me that the underlying problem had far less to do with the faulty tests produced by the C.D.C. than it did with a **system that could not contemplate, let alone manage, the possibility that the C.D.C. might end up producing faulty tests**. 

&gt; The C.D.C. quickly developed a working test, and it was understandable, at some level, that people at the Centers thought that fixing the faulty reagents for the public-health labs would be faster than shifting to an entirely different protocol.

Imagine how different the testing scene would be if they had made that announcement on February 4.  Hopefully they learn from that mistake and automatically make that sort of approval for future disease outbreaks.",1584468641,fkrgwpx

You don't wait for a fire to start building a fire department.

I'm making the case that the strains of anti-intellectualism in America helped allow such a president to be elected and take these kinds of expertise undermining actions, thus helping get the country into this predicament.  And I don't think conducting 26 tests per million to other country's 1 -5K per million is insignificant.

As a field tech, I assume you are usually not in an environment where you have to be close to others. This means you are less likely to catch or spread the disease as long as you are taking precautions. I would suggest wearing a mask and making sure you are carrying hand sanitizer. The mask might not prevent you from catching the virus, but it will greatly reduce the odds of you spreading it if you do catch the virus.

Also, this may be counter intuitive, it is desirable for the virus to continue to spread, just slowly, so we can build up that herd immunity.

&gt;For months, President Trump has made light of the coronavirus, telling attendees at a Black History Month reception, for instance, that perhaps the virus could miraculously disappear. He claimed on Twitter that the U.S. has done a “great job” handling the outbreak. Such a cavalier attitude seems unlikely to have motivated health officials to take things seriously. It also contradicted advice from most public-health experts. Even Scott Gottlieb, who recently resigned as Trump’s FDA commissioner, **wrote in The Wall Street Journal on February 4 that “it’s time to start testing more people.”**

&gt;Containing a new infectious disease requires a lot of close collaboration between the president, the CDC, the FDA, and other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services, several Obama-era health officials told me. “One reason we were able to move quickly [during the Ebola outbreak] was that there was a great deal of coordination and issue spotting and troubleshooting that went on,” Hamburg, the former FDA commissioner, told me.

Retesting people who have it will let us know when it's safe to release them from the hospital or for them to leave quarrantine.

The other reason is so we can identify the public health response to the virus. Like if we knew that there were hot spots of the virus we can infer the number of new cases on the horizon and direct resources to areas where the cases were increasing.

9406,hoosieranon,"Using a throwaway account here for reasons that will become obvious in just a moment. 

I’m an employee at the KTP Fiat-Chrysler plant and I agree that Indiana isn’t ready for this. While, yes, we’ve closed dining in for restaurants and bars, we haven’t shut down large factories like I work in. If I’m recalling correctly, the first case of COVID-19 in Howard county was a man that works in my plant, if he wasn’t the first, he was one of the first, I believe. 

My plant alone employees thousands of people from all over Indiana and that doesn’t even include the other plants here (CTP, ITP 1&amp;2, and Tipton). The company is doing very, very little in order to prevent employees from contracting and spreading the virus. 


https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.freep.com/amp/5030889002

In the above link, you’ll see that the Union Spokesperson has said they are doing everything they can to prevent the spread of the virus. I’m here to tell you that while, yes, they are taking tiny precautions such as sending home people who show signs of the flu, they are not in fact implementing those things they told the Detroit Free Press they were doing for us. 


""Additionally, the company has deep cleaned and disinfected his working area and is deploying additional sanitization measures across the entire facility, retiming break times to avoid crowding and deploying social spacing.""

I personally can’t speak for if the employees area was cleaned (I was assured by my union steward it had been) I can speak to the rest. As of today, the only measures my plant has taken is giving us cleaner to clean our stations, and telling us to wash our hands. They have not retimed any break times, everyone is still going to break at the same time. The only social spacing they have even attempted is keeping workers at the same work station for their entire shift. I do want to point out that even though this is a good idea, it doesn’t help those who work at stations directly next to other people. 


“As a reminder, Estrada said the UAW encourages all UAW members and others to wash hands frequently, use hand sanitizer frequently, avoid touching the face and avoid contact with others within 2 to 3 feet, if possible. Anyone experiencing symptoms of a high fever, dry cough or illness, should take precaution and stay home.” 

As for using hand sanitizer, my plant does not have any. I can walk through my entire department and the only hand sanitizer you will see is from those bringing it from home. We have not been given any nor told when or if we will have any in stock for the plant. 

And speaking to the last sentence of the above quote, this isn’t something that just everyone can do where I work. FCA works under a point system, and while yes, you should not use your points unless you have to, some people are in the position where they cannot call off if they’re sick and showing symptoms. If they did, that could mean a suspension at the very least or termination. As of now, I haven’t heard anything about changing this and many employees have stated that they’ll come in regardless of feeling sick or feverish because of this fact or the fact that they are the single person in their households bringing in an income. 

I wanted to comment and say this because while yes, we are doing small things like closing dine-in services, plants like mine, who employee thousands of people not only in Howard county, but multiple other counties and even other states, have done little to nothing about the pandemic. A factory like mine will be the reason this spreads far and quick, if they don’t do more prevent it.",1584504220,fkt28hq

9417,The_One_X,"While I think Indiana should be testing more, something i think most people do not understand is that in this situation you do not want to stop the spread of the disease completely. You want it to still spread, just at a slow rate. If you stop it from spreading completely you do not build up herd immunity, and as soon as it is re-introduced again (which with a pandemic this wide spread it will be) you are right back where you started. So while you want to close popular public gathering places, to stop the rapid spread, you still want enough interaction between people that herd immunity forms. 

So you do not want to shut down everything. That just prevents herd immunity from forming, and it destroys your economy. Ultimately, just resulting in the same scenario happening again a month later, just this time your economy is already in the shitter. So there is this balancing act. I think right now Indiana is in a good spot with a good balance. At this point it is more up to individuals to make the right choices.

&gt;In fact, closing restaurant dining rooms is but a fraction of the governor's authority during a declared disaster.

&gt;State law also authorizes the governor to shut off water, gas, electric and other utility services; direct or prohibit the movement of pedestrians and vehicles; suspend any state rule or regulation; evacuate and relocate the civilian population; and use any state or local government facility in any way the governor believes appropriate; among other powers.

9450,ZoeIsARobot,"&gt;It is decision made based on that testing the keeps the numbers low.

Yes, the decision for that patient to stay the fuck home. They can’t do that if they don’t know they’re positive.

&gt; while we are limiting testing to just those at high risk of catching the disease.

Yes this is the problem. We don’t even know who is at high risk of catching it because one of the criteria is association with a confirmed positive, and we’re not bloody testing that someone. We’re fighting this blind.

&gt; Considering that we are being very selective I consider it a good thing that only 33% of the tests are positive.

My point is that “being selective” isn’t going to contain the disease. Korea got it contained because they were aggressive. We’re not. When it’s not contained, the mortality rate increases drastically due to overwhelmed healthcare. As it stands, 20% of cases need hospitalization.

&gt; short of going full totalitarian there is not much more the state can do

Testing is not “full totalitarian,” and in a situation where massive amounts of people are dying because healthcare is overwhelmed (see Italy), drastic measures are necessary. Italy is in this situation because they didn’t act soon enough like Korea did. We are being Italy with our testing. Many people have symptoms and are rejected. It’s inexcusable.

Had we been aggressively testing, we never would even need to discuss more “more drastic measures,” which will now be necessary in the future when the state wakes the fuck up.

&gt; Personally, I would take coronavirus over a totalitarian government any day.

We’re not talking about a choice between the two.

We’re now going to see other conditions killing people while the state is over capacity with COVID-19. And if you’d rather get it fine, but your having it without knowing is what’s killing people. Have you not seen that asymptomatic people are driving the spread the most? Not only that, but many in critical care are younger, otherwise healthy patients. They have a lower mortality rate with our healthcare system but they do require it to live.

Anyway, here is the article. Sorry for the formatting.   


 

&gt;Woody Myers probably isn’t going to win the Indiana governor’s race.  
&gt;  
&gt;At least, that’s the conventional wisdom, and it seems correct. Myers is a [wealthy, yet little-known, Democrat](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/07/10/indiana-governors-race-woody-myers-plans-to-make-an-announcement-today/1681445001/) running against a popular Republican governor, Eric Holcomb, in a deep-red state. It’s a slam-dunk for Holcomb in normal times.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the novel coronavirus has thrust us into extraordinary times. Myers, a doctor and former state health commissioner whose most recent background is in venture capital, finds himself uniquely well suited to offer an alternative vision during an escalating public health crisis that he couldn’t have anticipated when he decided to run for governor.

 

&gt;Myers on Tuesday held a conference call with reporters in which he said all levels of government, including Indiana, have been too slow to respond to the coronavirus. He recommended further drastic measures, such as closing all Indiana schools, convening a special session of the state legislature and tapping $100 million from the state’s rainy day fund.  
&gt;  
&gt;If Myers were governor, he said a top priority would be to follow the latest Trump administration guidance to avoid public gatherings of 10 or more people. That means no school should be in session.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I would suspect virtually every classroom in the state has greater than 10 kids at any given time and those kids are mixing with adults throughout the school day,” Myers said.  
&gt;  
&gt;While children appear to be the least at-risk population for severe health effects caused by COVID-19, they can become infected by the coronavirus and spread it to other people. Elderly people are the most susceptible to falling seriously ill to the coronavirus, whose symptoms include a fever, cough and trouble breathing.  
&gt;  
&gt;“By closing these schools now, we minimize the likelihood we create clusters of infected individuals in those communities,” Myers said.

 

&gt;Holcomb has taken increasingly aggressive steps to avoid crowds, starting last week when he announced a limit on all non-essential gatherings to 250 people, which was consistent with Centers for Disease Control guidelines at the time. Holcomb on Monday announced additional restrictions, including the mandatory closing of all bars and restaurants — without a deadline for compliance, as other states set — and a stricter 50-person limit on gatherings.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet, Holcomb has not required schools to close, leaving 16 districts open as of Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;I wrote in a [Tuesday column](https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/james-briggs/2020/03/17/indianas-coronavirus-response-lagging-other-states/5063623002/) that Holcomb’s coronavirus response has seemed overly reliant on confirmed cases, a data point rendered too insufficient and outdated by scarce testing to support effective decision-making. But I’m also a person with no relevant public health education who is typing up opinion pieces in a playpen while my son’s daycare is closed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Myers, on the other hand, is an actual physician who has engaged in state-level health care policymaking. When he says that Indiana should do more, and faster, he is a voice worth listening to.

 

&gt;“We need leadership and then we need to take some aggressive steps,” Myers said.  
&gt;  
&gt;One way Myers said he would be more aggressive than Holcomb is by taking over private hotels in order to house homeless people during the pandemic. That proposal is sure to cause outrage, considering Holcomb is facing sharp criticism just for taking the increasingly common step of closing bars and restaurants across the state.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We’ve got a number of homeless people in Indiana, not just Indianapolis, but around the state,” Myers said. “Some of them are going to test positive for the coronavirus. If we leave them where they are today, in the encampments or shelters, then they will become vectors for the infection to be spread to others. We’re going to need to find places for them to go because they, unlike you and I, do not have the option of self-isolating.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Myers has a difficult challenge ahead in reminding people there is a gubernatorial campaign happening at a time like this. Myers planned to experiment with a Facebook town hall Tuesday night and is considering other types of virtual events in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We’re in an unprecedented time,” Myers said. “This has not happened before. There are no rules. There are no guidelines for what to do when your campaign is interrupted by a coronavirus pandemic. We are writing the book on that one.”

 

&gt;The pandemic seems unlikely to change the fundamentals of the governor’s race. Holcomb has earned his popularity by being a generally thoughtful and competent governor who has stayed focused on issues that matter. Myers could do everything right and still fall short.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nonetheless, Myers’ candidacy just became more notable. In a state where people are reticent about criticizing public officials, Myers has both the credibility and incentive to speak authoritatively on how Indiana is performing on what just became the most important issue of 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;Myers is a longshot to become governor. But, win or lose, he has an opportunity to be influential.

Also, medical billing is typically separate from the entity in many cases, just as billing forwards to ""collections"" the hospital forwards to billing and does not always have ""direct control"".

9798,quincyd,"I used to work in unemployment for Indiana. I’m happy to try and help. 

You say you’re unable to work- I’m not sure what that means. So I’ll try and list the different scenarios I can think of. 

If you’re unable to work due to your pregnancy (like, you’re on bed rest or it was uncomfortable for you to sit/stand at your job, etc.) and that’s the reason you left your job, then no. You would likely not qualify for unemployment. Part of qualifying for unemployment is that you’re able to actively seek employment and if you’re unable to work due to your pregnancy, you wouldn’t meet that requirement. Plus, if you left voluntarily, then the state sees that as your choice and not a reason to give you unemployment. 

If you’re unable to work because your employer cut your hours, then you should file due to a reduction in hours. However, you are not guaranteed to receive unemployment in this situation, depending on a number of factors, such as how your job was classified, if you were a part/full time employee, how much you were making previously, and what your wages for the last state defined fiscal quarter was (among other things). But if your hours were cut and you’re now making less per week than what you would qualify for in unemployment, then you should at least file and let the state make that determination. You will still have to report wages to the state weekly in your claim and those will be deducted from what the state determines you would get. (So if you were determined to qualify for $350 per week and you made $300 that week from your job, you would only get $50 from unemployment.)

If you were laid off or the business closed, then file. You will likely not receive unemployment right away if you got a lay-off package (like paying your salary/wages for 90 days) because the state sees that as income. But you might qualify beyond that. 

If you were fired from your position for violating a rule, then you can still apply but you would likely be denied. There are exceptions to this, but the employer can (and usually does) fight the claim. 

If you had to leave your job due to domestic violence, then you can file and you may receive support while you’re transitioning to a safer place. I’m not as familiar with this; you would need to talk with someone at WorkOne about this.

The thing is, anyone can apply for unemployment.  I will tell you what I remember about the process from when I worked there. Things may have changed. Once you file, the claim is sent to the employer and they have the opportunity to approve or deny it (since they’re the ones who pay into the fund). If they approve it, the claim goes through and the claimant (you) will begin receiving unemployment. However, understand that this may take a few weeks to kick in. You would file weekly while it was being approved and then receive back claims once approved. 

If the employer denies the claim, then it goes to an adjudicator and they investigate the claim. The adjudicator is usually in the local WorkOne office and is a first step. They make a decision: deny or approve, then the claimant and employer are notified. Depending on the decision, either party can appeal and it will go to a second adjudicator, parties will be notified again. The decision can be appealed again, and this time the claim would go to the judge. The judge has the last say in the matter. If you end up going this route, they tell you to continue to file claims each week and if you win, you will receive back pay from the claims you filed (up to a certain amount). 

In the past, the government has put money into the fund to extend how many weeks claimants could be on unemployment. This may already be the case, I don’t know. But I could see the state/feds doing this in light of the current situation; however, it’s not a given. 

This is probably more than you needed to know, but I figure too much info is better than not enough! Again, this is based on my experience working at WorkOne a few years back so things may have changed since then. Others may be able to jump in and add/clarify/update.",1584597821,fkwn1lv

I would like to see your source on the virus only lives 72 hours. Everything I have seen says we don’t know how long it can survive without a host.

The point of cleaning and sanitizing, to me at least, is, why not? The cleaners and chemicals that we use kill everything, coronavirus included, so why not use them if we have them and the man power to do it?

Just like the main point in my original comment, there have been countless people in and out of the building, some without reason, who knows where they have been and who they have been in contact with? I want to make my building safe and clean for anyone who may enter it. My school is a P.O.D. for the local health department, which means at any moment, we could be inundated with all walks of life needing and wanting help and resources and medication. That is reason enough for me to pull the over time and work the long days, to make sure that my building is clean and sanitary for whoever needs to use it at a moment’s notice.

I still have normal work going on as well. IT is in classrooms changing smart board projector bulbs, contractors are on site installing a new chiller, a remodel is being done on a cafeteria serving line, maintenance guys are fixing leaking pipes... Myself and my custodians are all over the building as well. Things need to be cleaned, things need to be sanitized.

10095,jbrogdon,"very fair point about the other individuals with ongoing access to &amp; interaction w/ the building.  My son told me they were disinfecting all of the lockers at his building, which seemed particularly unnecessary to me, so I just wanted to throw the question out to someone actually involved in the process.

Thanks also for sharing the point about the school bldg being a potential site for future community use, which I hadn't considered.  That would be particularly important in a rural community.

There are several publications out there discussing the half-life of the virus and how long it remains a viable threat in the environment,  both in the air and on surfaces.  Here's one from the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home).. they have made all of their covid-19 material open to the public.  My general take away as a lay person has been that somewhere after the 6-12 hour range for air(aerosol), and 72 hour range for surfaces, it's no longer contaminated for SARS-CoV-2.

/r/Coronavirus has definitely had a link or two in there about surface contamination if you want to look further!

I don’t know if I agree with the disinfection of lockers, but I also do not open any student lockers without building admin or our SRO present (crazy parents can claim they had anything in the locker, and now it is missing). But we are using static spray misters, loaded with our disinfectant, to spray out locker-room lockers since they are expanded metal and we don’t have to open them to get the spray inside. Also, high school locker rooms are disgusting regardless of an ongoing pandemic. Which also brings up another thought, there are probably personal belongings in some of the student’s lockers that they might not want to go two months without.

I have a couple of rentals in Indiana, not a large property manager, so this is just a guess, but I would *guess* they are telling him to vacate based on a public health threat or something to do with campus, not actually pursuing the legal eviction process for breach of contract.  As such, whatever legal basis they were using before is probably unchanged (in my, completely non-legal, opinion) by today's Executive Order.. just a heads up.

Definitely reach out to https://housing4hoosiers.org/ (based in Bloomington), I'm sure they are getting a ton of questions on this right now.

10537,noxeos,"Yup I was in the ER a couple days ago due to very shallow breathing and chest pain. I have asthma, but it is usually VERY mild and seasonal. I keep it under control with Albuterol Sulfate and Spiriva (only as needed). I work as a bartender here in Dearborn County and easily came into contact with over 200 people on Saturday the 14th. All the close talking and dirty glasses and germs is part of the job. This was my progression:

Day 1 (Monday) - Sore throat, runny nose

Day 2 - Sore throat subsides, dry cough, sneezing, runny nose

Day 3 - Severe shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain from dry cough, my medications/inhalers were not alleviating my lungs AT ALL, difficulty breathing awoke me from sleep at 5am and was very severe, so I had to get to ER. I passed out on arrival, probably due to lack of proper breathing and anxiety. 

*No fever has been experienced at all. While at ER I was swabbed for flu, but no COVID-19 testing allowed as I had not visited China recently nor come into contact with a KNOWN case. Chest X Ray showed no pneumonia, I was given a breathing treatment, extra albuterol prescription and prednisone steroid. Released quickly from ER. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS SEVERITY OF LUNG ISSUE IN THE PAST EVEN WITH MY ASTHMA. It was very scary, this is highly atypical for my condition, yet people like me are still not being tested. Told to quarantine at home for 14 days (which I already started doing as of Sunday.)

Day 4 (Thursday) - Had to use my nebulizer at home several times throughout the day. Chest still tight but remained calm to reduce anxiety and try to stabilize breathing. Was better during the day but got pretty bad at night again. Decided to wait it out and not return to ER unless it got worse.

Day 5 - Lungs looser and more relaxed, able to breathe easier. Taking meds as needed. Cough still present but less pronounced and now producing phlegm.

Day 6 (Today) - Crackling lung cough due to phlegm, sounds/feels similar to when I get bronchitis. Chest still on the tight side, breathing is ok. Sneezing, runny nose and congestion gone. Only issue left now is slight chest tightness and cough. Taking meds as prescribed, hoping it will clear up soon. No fever throughout any of this illness. 

As you can see I didn't have all the telltale symptoms, but not everyone will. I am in my early 30's and aside from mild asthma I am very healthy. Since not enough testing is being done I can't say one way or another if I had COVID-19. I have to assume that I do and act accordingly as urged by many, but obviously I won't know for sure. My concern is the reaction my respiratory system had with my normal inhalers/meds failing to work for me and assist my breathing. Genuinely this was a first, I haven't experienced an actual asthma attack before.I was diagnosed with asthma after a bad case of pneumonia years ago and that illness was the closest in similarity. Essentially I have had this condition for over 5 years without such a severe experience as this. 

Please guys be safe, my mild ""seasonal"" asthma got very scary very fast due to catching whatever it was I caught, whether it was a regular cold or something worse. Hope my experience can help some of you in similar situations. If you guys have anything to add or any questions please feel free, but be aware I am NOT a medical professional and if you are having serious breathing issues go to an ER right away to avoid respiratory failure.

10597,FreshCan2,"Hmmm. I have been told by Medicaid that’s not how it works. If he claims them as dependents they are in the same tax household which is the household Medicare counts. I’m wondering if it was different for you since you were an unmarried mother with a young child. Many states have separate plans for that situation. It doesn’t matter if they are married or not. They have cohabitated for the full year and he pays all of their expenses. Medicare doesn’t care if they’re married. It’s a tax household not a family. I have been told this by several different agents actually. All members of the same tax family share the same income as the income Medicaid calculates is from your taxes directly. They all have the same taxes, the same income amount. 

Also I just want to state that I NEVER said that I wanted to report her at all. I was just asking what the ramifications would be if I did report her or someone else did. What I am afraid of is if I file for him since she is on his taxes will it then trigger a investigation into her Medicaid account?  I definitely agree that nobody should lack health care especially now but if she if filing fraudulently then everyone (every tax payer) is paying for her fraud. Not only is it fraud but it’s fraud we’re all paying for. That isn’t fair or reasonable to expect anyone to do and it’s wrong. I don’t want anyone to be without healthcare, it should be a human right but in the US it isn’t. That is the reality.

Meaning if you are sick it is still substantially more likely (at least 87% based on the small sample size of patients with a high pretest probability, incidentally, this concept is why you don’t test everyone and applies to nearly every medical test) you have a one of a variety of other upper respiratory viruses.

I think it makes sense that a new infection would seize an opportunity to infect a host whose immune system is already tired from fighting the initial infection. that's how I usually end up with a sinus infection after a cold, or bacterial pneumonia after a cold/flu.

A month long shutdown in terms of only “essential businesses” being open, that will cost this country dearly, financially. I read that it would be less expensive to entirely rebuild our medical infrastructure from the ground up than to shut down the country bc of the financial losses (jobs, businesses going under, unemployment costs, etc)...that’s a hole from which we may not recover for a generation.

Let’s think about this for a moment.... all the skilled laborers that took 4-8 years of their life to become journey men and masters at their trade, Indiana isn’t shut down, so they still have to work through this. While they are working the stock market is still tanking. They’re working anyway, just like essential personnel, even though their particular jobs aren’t essential. They get sick, half of them are gone. Now we made it out of the pandemic. We need to rebuild the stock market so the economy can be great again. These factories that are essential to our economy have only a fraction of the skilled plumbers, electricians, and heating  and cooling guys they need on maintenance to make sure the plants run so the line workers can work without infrastructure disruptions. Oh, the skilled tradesmen aren’t all there.  Plants won’t run correctly to rebuild the economy. It’s just like nature, we all play our part in the infrastructure that is the economy.

From [a doctor in New Orleans](https://www.propublica.org/article/a-medical-worker-describes--terrifying-lung-failure-from-covid19-even-in-his-young-patients):

&gt;I’m seeing people who look relatively healthy with a minimal health history, and they are completely wiped out, like they’ve been hit by a truck. This is knocking out what should be perfectly fit, healthy people. Patients will be on minimal support, on a little bit of oxygen, and then all of a sudden, they go into complete respiratory arrest, shut down and can’t breathe at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have an observation unit in the hospital, and we have been admitting patients that had tested positive or are presumptive positive — these are patients that had been in contact with people who were positive. We go and check vitals on patients every four hours, and some are on a continuous cardiac monitor, so we see that their heart rate has a sudden increase or decrease, or someone goes in and sees that the patient is struggling to breathe or is unresponsive. That seems to be what happens to a lot of these patients: They suddenly become unresponsive or go into respiratory failure.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;With our coronavirus patients, once they’re on ventilators, most need  about the highest settings that we can do. About 90% oxygen, and 16 of PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure, which keeps the lung inflated.  This is nearly as high as I’ve ever seen. The level we’re at means we  are running out of options.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;It  first struck me how different it was when I saw my first coronavirus  patient go bad. I was like, Holy shit, this is not the flu. Watching  this relatively young guy, gasping for air, pink frothy secretions  coming out of his tube and out of his mouth. The ventilator should have  been doing the work of breathing but he was still gasping for air,  moving his mouth, moving his body, struggling. We had to restrain him.  With all the coronavirus patients, we’ve had to restrain them. They  really hyperventilate, really struggle to breathe. When you’re in that  mindstate of struggling to breathe and delirious with fever, you don’t  know when someone is trying to help you, so you’ll try to rip the  breathing tube out because you feel it is choking you, but you are  drowning.  
&gt;  
&gt;When  someone has an infection, I’m used to seeing the normal colors you’d  associate with it: greens and yellows. The coronavirus patients with ARDS have been having a lot of secretions that are actually pink because  they’re filled with blood cells that are leaking into their airways.  They are essentially drowning in their own blood and fluids because  their lungs are so full. So we’re constantly having to suction out the  secretions every time we go into their rooms.   
&gt;  
&gt;Before this, we were all joking. It’s grim humor. If you are exposed to  the virus and test positive and go on quarantine, you get paid. We were all joking: I want to get the coronavirus because then I get a paid  vacation from work. And once I saw these patients with it, I was like, ""Holy shit, I do not want to catch this and I don’t want anyone I know to  catch this.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I worked a long stretch of days last week, and I watched it go from this  novelty to a serious issue. We had one or two patients at our hospital,  and then five to 10 patients, and then 20 patients. Every day, the  intensity kept ratcheting up. More patients, and the patients themselves  are starting to get sicker and sicker. When it first started, we all  had tons of equipment, tons of supplies, and as we started getting more  patients, we started to run out. They had to ration supplies. At first  we were trying to use one mask per patient. Then it was just: You get  one mask for positive patients, another mask for everyone else. And now it’s just: You get one mask.",1584939332,fl92ynu

11218,ProfPlumInTheStudy,"The main problem with this idea is that market ""disrupters"" have cemented a model of business that leans heavily on capital investments and commercial  credit markets to scale up really quickly to compete. An example: Robinhood, a small investment app, reduced commission fees to zero so individuals could circumvent the vice grip traditional brokerages have held on investing, and within a couple of years, it got so big that two huge firms with &gt; 150 years of combined market presence had to do a merger just to compete. 

It illustrates that emergency funds (liquidity reserves) have been sidelined in favor of a blitzkrieg model of business. Many companies that are publicly traded see the credit markets like money that can't be left on the table, or else someone else will take it and gobble up your marketshare of a given industry. And this is generally true! Competitors WILL surpass a given company if it doesn't use credit markets to maintain dominance. The sad result is a big part of our economy is leveraged to the hilt, and the valuation of that credit has soared in the past 2 or 3 decades. 

It's still a free economy, but instead of a collective form that uses good accounting principles and operates like a consistent tugboat, instead you have every major business (at least the ones that can be affected by activist investors)...operating at breakneck pace. That makes for an economy that looks more like a runaway freight train, and as such, it cannot withstand a major nudge from an exterior force without coming completely off the rails. 

I'd strap in, our politicians don't know how to ask individuals and communities to make sacrifices. We could endure this together with some smart sacrifices in lifestyle and a return to good old sweat labor to start making our own things again.  There's too much individualism in our way of thinking, so instead, these guys are gonna do absurd fiscal things like try to give everyone $2000 to spend to keep the economy lubricated.

 Sure, add a trillion to our national debt to hand out some cash. That's what got us here. And anyway people in panic mode hold onto money, they don't spend it. That's a good formula for hyper inflation.

Sorry for the pessimism, but I'm seeing lunacy at every turn, and no one courageous enough to lead us down a harder, but better path.

 Be safe, act wisely, and by God, please take care of each other. We're all in this together. If and when a vaccine is developed and we get back to normal, a lot of people will need help. Let's not scorn the hard work it will take to do good for our neighbors.",1584976733,fla4yw5

INDIANAPOLIS – Governor Eric J. Holcomb delivered a statewide address Moday to order that Hoosiers remain in their homes except when they are at work or for permitted activities, such as taking care of others, obtaining necessary supplies, and for health and safety. Click here to see the executive order. Below are frequently asked questions and their answers.

When does the order take effect?

The Stay-At-Home Order takes effect Tuesday, March 24 at 11:59 p.m. ET.

When does the order end?

The order ends on Monday, April 6, at 11:59 p.m. ET, but could be extended if the outbreak warrants it.

Where does the order apply?

The Stay-At-Home Order applies to the entire state of Indiana. Unless you work for an essential business or are doing an essential activity, you must stay home.

Is this mandatory or a recommendation?

This order is mandatory. For the safety of all Hoosiers, people must stay home and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

How will this order be enforced?

Staying home is critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19 in your community. Adhering to the order will save lives, and it is the responsibility of every Hoosier to do their part. However, if the order is not followed, the Indiana State Police will work with local law enforcement to enforce this order. The Indiana State Department of Health and the Alcohol and Tobacco Commission will enforce the restaurant and bar restrictions.

Will the Indiana National Guard enforce this order?

No. The Indiana National Guard is aiding in planning, preparation and logistics with other state agencies. For example, the Indiana National Guard assists in distributing hospital supplies the state receives.

What is an essential business?

Essential businesses and services include but are not limited to grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, police stations, fire stations, hospitals, doctor’s offices, health care facilities, garbage pickup, public transit, and public service hotlines such as SNAP and HIP 2.0.  

A list can be found in the Governor’s executive order at in.gov/coronavirus.

What is an essential activity?

Essential activities include but are not limited to activities for health and safety, necessary supplies and services, outdoor activity, certain types of essential work, and to take care of others.

A list can be found in the Governor’s executive order at in.gov/coronavirus.

I work for an essential business. Will I be allowed to travel to and from work?

Law enforcement will not be stopping drivers on their way to and from work, traveling for an essential activity such as going to the grocery store, or just taking a walk.

Will the grocery store/pharmacy be open?

Yes, grocery stores and pharmacies are essential services.

Can I still order take out/delivery from restaurants and bars?

Yes, restaurants and bars can continue to provide takeout and delivery, but should be closed to dine-in patrons.

Can I get my groceries delivered? Can I still get my online orders delivered?

Yes, you can still receive packages, get groceries delivered, and get meals delivered.

How can I get medical care?

If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough and/or difficulty breathing, and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, stay home and call your healthcare provider.

If you suspected you have COVID-19, please call the healthcare provider in advance so that proper precautions can be taken to limit further transmission. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their healthcare provider early, even if their illness is mild.

If you have severe symptoms, such as persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, contact your healthcare provider or emergency room and seek care immediately, but please call in advance if possible. Your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you should be tested.

Nonessential medical care such as eye exams and teeth-cleaning should be postponed. When possible, health care visits should be done remotely. Contact your health care provider to see what telehealth services they provide.

What is the guidance for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities?

State-operated developmental centers, intermediate care facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities and community integrated living arrangements will continue to provide care. All in-home direct care staff are considered essential staff and should continue to support individuals in the home setting.  

If you have specific questions about your support and services, reach out to your provider or individual service coordination agency.

What if I still have to go to work?

You should stay home unless your work is an essential function such as a health care provider, grocery store clerk or first responder. If you have been designated essential by your employer, you should continue to go to work and practice social distancing.

A list of essential businesses can be found in the Governor’s executive order at in.gov/coronavirus.

What if I think my business should be closed, but they’re still asking me to report to work?

Essential businesses will remain open during the stay-at-home order to provide services that are vital to the lives of Hoosiers. If you believe your business is nonessential but still are being asked to show up to work, you may discuss it with your employer.

A certain service is essential for me, but the governor didn’t include it. What do I do?

The stay-at-home order was issued to protect the health, safety and well-being of Hoosiers. Although some businesses such as fitness centers and salons will be closed, essential services will always be available. For a list of essential businesses that will continue to operate during the order, visit in.gov/coronavirus.

Will public transportation, ride-sharing and taxis continue?

Public transportation, ride-sharing and taxis should only be used for essential travel.

Will roads in Indiana be closed?

No, the roads will remain open. You should only travel if it is for your health or essential work.

Can I still take a plane out of Indiana?

Planes and other types of transportation should be used for essential travel.

What if my home is not a safe environment?

If it is not safe for you to remain home, you are able and encouraged to find another safe place to stay during this order. Please reach out so someone can help. You can call the domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or your local law enforcement.

What about homeless people who cannot stay at home?

The administration wants to protect the health and safety of all Hoosiers, regardless of where they live. State agencies are partnering with community organizations to ensure the homeless population has safe shelter.

For your safety, as well as the safety of all Hoosiers, you should remain at home to help fight the spread of COVID-19. You may visit family members who need medical or other essential assistance, such as ensuring an adequate food supply.

Can I walk my dog or go to the veterinarian?

You are allowed to walk your dog and seek medical care for your pet should they require it. Practice social distancing while out on walks, maintaining at least 6 feet from other neighbors and their pets.

Can I take my kids to the park?

State parks remain open, but welcome centers, inns, and other buildings are closed. Families will be able to go outside and take a walk, run or bike ride, but they should continue to practice social distancing by remaining 6 feet away from other people. Playgrounds are closed because they pose a high risk of increasing spreading the virus.

Can I attend a religious service?

Large gatherings, including church services, will be canceled to slow the spread of COVID-19. Religious leaders are encouraged to continue livestreaming services while practicing social distancing with one another.

Can I leave my home to exercise?

Outdoor exercise such as running or taking a walk is acceptable. However, gyms, fitness centers and associated facilities will be closed to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

11504,Languadick,"Whatever. I'll do this for a few weeks, and then WE-- not our ""leaders""- have got to figure something out. We can't wait one year to 18 mos for a vaccine. If it's going to hibernate, and come back w/ another wave anyway-- we've got to figure out a way to be functional while mitigating risk. The real economic consequences of this in the long term are terrifying.

Like the Great Depression, 9/11, the Great Recession; those setup to weather this storm will actually thrive in it, and come back stronger and wealthier than ever by pouncing on opportunities(I'm not demonizing them BTW) while people at the bottom will have an even harder time gaining ground. The big dogs are still making moves and moving money, while the little guy is frozen stiff and losing ground.  This will cost lives just like the virus. 

IMO, our healthcare system needs overhauling, and I don't have the answer. I can see the issues w/ a national system, but I see a HUGE problem with the cost of healthcare and with the way health insurance works/costs. It's insane.  We need to fix that, and we need to fix the way we spend our money as Americans. It's about priorities. We have terrible priorities in terms of spending, and that creates a fragile system. The little guy has to stop wasting the little money he has on creature comforts, and focus spending on making his/her life less dependent on systems that are set up to fail.

 In my tiny little brain, what I want, is a system where the government stays the hell out of almost everything, but education, the legal system, a healthcare option, defense,  infrastructure, and a baseline of food and shelter for those who can't afford it. I'm sure I'm missing something, but you get the point. I've got a strong back, and I'm cool with my tax dollars going to THOSE things, but the govt needs to stay  out of the way, or for Heaven's sake help, small business, and NEVER give $$$ to financial institutions simply because when they fuck up and fail, the system won't hold up. If that's the system, it needs rebuilt anyway. 

TL/DR: More afraid of the long term effects than the virus(which I don't deny is terrible), and I think that the reasonable people in this country need to look in the mirror regarding our priorities. Or some shit. I dunno.",1584984075,flaho99

For Immediate Release:  
**Monday, March 23, 2020**

**Hotline opens Tuesday to help business and industry with Stay-at-Home Order**

Indiana will open a call center to field industry questions about Governor Eric J. Holcomb’s Executive Order 20-08, which provides for essential and non-essential business operations, infrastructure and government functions while the state observes a stay-at-home order from March 25-April 7.

The Critical Industries Hotline will open Tuesday at 9 a.m. to help guide businesses and industries with the executive order.

This center, reachable by calling 877-820-0890 or by emailing [covidresponse@iedc.in.gov](mailto:covidresponse@iedc.in.gov), is for business and industry questions only.

Please read Gov. Holcomb’s executive order and this [FAQ page](https://www.in.gov/gov/3232.htm) to clarify restrictions and acceptable activities and services under Monday’s Executive Order.

11819,BBurton46,"Marijuana itself and the way the criminal justice system deals with it are two separate issues. There is nothing good about weed, nothing that makes it somehow obvious it SHOULD be legal (and bringing up alcohol and tobacco would only serve an argument to ban them as well, not to legalize pot), it isn't a good thing and neither is it something that should at all be a socially acceptable habit. However, I'm not saying it should be illegal (and neither am I saying alcohol or tobacco should be, I was just responding to a popular counter), and as I said previously, I support legalization. If I had my way, all drugs would be legal; it isn't the government's business what people put in their bodies.

That being said, the criminal justice response to marijuana (and all drugs up to and including hard drugs like meth or heroin), unlike its legal status, is a SIGNIFICANT problem, both in terms of its contribution to prison populations and in terms of the inequity of enforcement. But that is part of a broader issue, and one that simply legalizing weed won't solve or even begin to solve.

**Hotline opens Tuesday to help business and industry with Stay-at-Home Order**

Indiana will open a call center to field industry questions about Governor Eric J. Holcomb’s Executive Order 20-08, which provides for essential and non-essential business operations, infrastructure and government functions while the state observes a stay-at-home order from March 25-April 7.

The Critical Industries Hotline will open Tuesday at 9 a.m. to help guide businesses and industries with the executive order.

This center, reachable by calling 877-820-0890 or by emailing [covidresponse@iedc.in.gov](mailto:covidresponse@iedc.in.gov), is for business and industry questions only.

Please read Gov. Holcomb’s executive order and this [FAQ page](https://www.in.gov/gov/3232.htm) to clarify restrictions and acceptable activities and services under Monday’s Executive Order.

Marijuana use is less harmful to society than speeding in a vehicle, which kills thousands annually yet we never refer to them as being unlawful and being caught speeding doesn’t create a criminal justice record that makes getting employment harder like marijuana despite the fact that you have committed a crime in both circumstances.

However, the idea that being caught with an illicit item of any kind shouldn't ring any bells about someone's character with regards to employment is kind of silly, regardless of how ""harmful"" it is or isn't. Stupid games, stupid prizes. Speeding, in comparison, isn't necessarily on the same level of possession given it is still a controlled substance.

On the FAQ on their website it says this

&gt;I work for an essential business. Will I be allowed to travel to and from work?

&gt;Law enforcement will not be stopping drivers on their way to and from work, traveling for an essential activity such as going to the grocery store, or just taking a walk.

So that means they won't be doing anything. They have no way of knowing what you are on your way to, and based on the above it doesn't sound like there will be checkpoints since they are just blanketly stating they won't stop you while on your way to work etc.

12071,Pits_and_ass,"&gt; While I'm not against it, I'm definitely against the flawed mindset that they didn't break the law

Our laws weren't written by gods, they were written by men....specifically rich, white, men. Men with prejudices and motives. Drug laws weren't written to end some social menace, but were crafted to specifically hound and terrorize certain classes of people. Black people, poor people, and the youth. Nixon's own cabinet members have openly admitted to it! 

We don't just have the moral right to break unjust, racist, and classist laws, we have the civic *obligation.* I'll leave you with a quote from MLK's letter from a Birmingham jail:

&gt; One may well ask: “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all.”",1585054595,fld28fd

Lol, ""I don't want to hear your ""estimations"" and ""facts, becuase they disagree with the point I'm making!""

Well, let's listen to Nixon's on domestic advisor, John Ehrlichman:

&gt; ""The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.""

Indiana's communication on this has been subpar compared to other those examples, and his lockdown presser made me wonder if it was partly a church service halfway through.  That being said, in terms of policy movements, we're probably hanging in the 10 -18 range on our response in rankings if I had to peg it.  Given our national ranking on so many other things, that's not bad.  I feel like we're lucky it's not Pence still at the least.  Daniels would have been better at public communication, but I'm not convinced he would have rolled out policies sooner necessarily - or maybe not by much - but even a few days is huge with a pandemic.  Side note - I have been pleasantly surprised by Daniels at Purdue - didn't like the optics of how that transition played out - but no denying he's done a really unique &amp; great job there so far.

Under the lockdown you can keep your firearms, alcohol and anything else that might get confiscated (or throw you in jail for having.) So you can drink, shoot (if you have a safe place on your property), and vape your desired drug of choice at home. 

People really exaggerate this lockdown. For those of us who have been in “lockdown” because the snow is 3’ deep or higher out the front door, this is not bad. A little longer than normal.

On the morrow I depart with Aiden and Jayden for Miami Beach. If I get corona, I get corona. At day's end, I shan't allow it to stop me. We have long awaited Miami spring break. Whatever happens, shall happen.

Why do you think more taxes will solve our problems? Our government has plenty of money to do everything you wish our government would do. The problem isn't taxes. The problem with out government is priorities. See you do understand what the problem is, we need to get money out of politics.

Not enough? Read on:

&gt; States have police power functions to protect the health, safety, and welfare of persons within their borders. To control the spread of disease within their borders, states have laws to enforce the use of isolation and quarantine.

Door greeters, cart collectors, and all the people running the secondary businesses inside a grocery store (vision center, hair salon, independent jewelers, whatever) are definitely not.

For the people who are actually needed, they should be getting paid a bunch extra for the danger they're in (especially for customer-facing positions), and they should minimize the number of people working each job (longer shifts and schedule each person every day. Downside is this will increase the risk to that individual, but it will greatly reduce the number of people exposed, and the number of transition events which probably will be the highest contributor to infection).

I and farmers on two sides have been trying to get rid of a group of beavers for 3 years now. They cut every single tree along a drainage ditch and continuously plug it up. When I say every tree, they'll cut saplings in a minute or two, a 3"" tree in an hour (and cut it up), and they'll ring an 18"" tree until it dies and falls then start cutting it up. The trees are needed for erosion protection (among other things) and the drainage ditch is needed for drainage. The beaver is 2nd only to man in habitat destruction. I like seeing them in the wild but they are a HUGE pain in the ass if you have to deal with them.

13182,KANNABULL,"  Herd immunity (a term that describes social distancing in incremental stages to give an immune system the ability to defend itself through divided exposure) is the best chance we have of fending it off from here on out, what makes this virus so dangerous in particular is that it originates from an animal only native to SouthEast Asia (Pangolin, an armadillo/anteater type mammal). The hydrogen bonds in this new virus gives it a 3-4 hour shelf life for vector transmission and it can incubate for up to 14 days in a human host. 

&amp;#x200B;

  So far we know it ravages immune systems already weakened by a previous illness and quite effectively I might add as the 19 Hoosiers it has been fatal to have all succumbed to fatal respiratory failure within a week of confirmation. Vitamin C and water are your best defenses for personal protection social distancing and isolation will not stop it now, only slow it to create a resistance by exposing it slowly to many immune systems capable of eliminating it's intensity and dormancy period. 

&amp;#x200B;

  OTC medications can be just as dangerous forcing your body to process toxins designed to defend variolas and coronas that are not new, and we do not know how this new virus reacts to different medicines yet. The best and only known way to defend as of yet is boosting your own immunity with natural supplements like Vitamin C, D, and antioxidants. Hydration will prevent mucous production with regulated salt intake, good sources of protein means better dendritic matrix in your T-cells so peanut butter is ideal. 

&amp;#x200B;

  I feel like if people want to choose to be out and risk their lives that is their choice because there is literally no way to stop it now due to the fact if a host is infected they may not know it for up to five days. I've followed Guido Vanham back when I was researching for a book I was writing and I trust his opinion when it comes to viruses.  He believes that following two weeks from peak transmission we should see a sharp decrease in cases based on herd immunity and ability to stave off asymptomatic cases. 

&amp;#x200B;

  If you have children though, Vanham suggests separating them from the at risk age group of around 55 years or older and by separation I mean no physical contact or using the same areas. This is because humans with a healthier immune system that may show no immediate symptoms can transmit it to those who may show immediate symptoms. 

&amp;#x200B;

  Now isn't the time to really judge anyone or make them feel like they are doing things wrong because this is new to all of us and we need to inform each other rather than adhere to fear because the virus is out there now and there is no stopping it. Keep those hands clean people, fingernails too, and stay safe hope this helps anyone who may not know much.",1585243812,flkmqxe

Nearly 1.5 million N95 respirator masks are sitting in a U.S. government warehouse in Indiana and authorities have not shipped them because they are past their expiration date, despite Centers for Disease Control guidelines that have been issued for their safe use during the coronavirus outbreak, according to five people with knowledge of the stockpile.

Department of Homeland Security officials had a conference call Wednesday to figure out what to do with the masks, which are part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s emergency supplies. DHS officials decided to offer the respirators to the Transportation Security Administration, whose workforce has been clamoring for protective equipment, according to three of the people who described the plans on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

CBP has no plans to offer the masks to hard-hit hospitals, or hand them over to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, three of the people said.

The N95 masks, which provide essential protection to medical personnel treating infected patients, are one of the items that have gone lacking in New York City hospitals and across the country in recent days as demand for equipment soars. Manufacturers have said the masks remain effective if stored properly, and the main risk with age is that the masks’ elastic bands can weaken and prevent a proper seal against a user’s face.

According to two of the people with knowledge of the CBP stockpile, the masks are stored in a warehouse in Indianapolis.

Nathan Peeters, a CBP spokesman, said the agency is aware the supplies are available and that it has been “working with our DHS partners to determine the best use for N95 respirators in CBP’s emergency stockpile.”

The agency has provided a 30-day supply of protective equipment to Border Patrol agents and CBP officers, including N95 respirators, Peeters said.

“U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s highest priority is to ensure the health, safety and security of our workforce and the American people,” he said. According to Peeters, the agency is in the process of acquiring and distributing 1.5 million additional N95 masks and other protective gear that would be shipped in coming weeks.

It was unclear Thursday when the expired N95 masks in the Indiana warehouse would ship. FEMA did not respond to questions about the CBP stockpiles.

TSA confirmed it has received an offer for a large quantity of N95 masks from CBP and that they will be distributed to airports as needed.

“TSA remains committed to the health and safety of our workforce and is now authorizing the use of eye protection and N95 respirators for employees,” said TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein. “Employees have had the option to wear surgical masks since the beginning of the pandemic, and use of TSA standard nitrile gloves continues to be mandatory when screening an individual or their property, which adds an additional layer of protection.”

One administration official with knowledge of the plans said the decision was made to provide the masks to TSA because FEMA has been able to acquire a large number of new masks for distribution this week. President Trump said during a White House briefing Wednesday that FEMA has shipped or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators and 20 million surgical masks for hospitals.

“And we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly,” Trump said.

The masks and other protective gear are in such short supply at some New York City hospitals that staff have been wearing plastic garbage bags and other improvised equipment as they hope to ward off infection while treating patients.

Health officials in Los Angeles County said its emergency supply of N95 masks is exhausted, encouraging doctors and nurses to consider reusing the disposable masks for multiple patients, a practice that is generally avoided because of the risk of spreading the virus among patients and hospital rooms.

The CDC issued new guidelines on Feb. 28 for the safe use of expired N95 masks, affirming that many models remain functional past their expiration date, provided they were properly stored. In normal circumstances, they would be discarded, but they still remain effective if the guidelines are followed.

“The respirators exceeding their manufacturer-designated shelf life are only being released due to the potential urgent demand caused by the covid-19 public health emergency,” the agency said.

“In the face of this emergency, the U.S. government believes that the respirators beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life should provide greater respiratory protection than surgical masks (i.e., medical masks) alone, improvised mouth and nose covers (e.g., bandannas), or no protection at all,” the CDC said.

A senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the masks, said the masks in CBP storage are in usable condition.

“The masks are fully capable,” the official said. “We’d never put the lives of the men and women at DHS at risk.”

Randolph “Tex” Alles, the acting undersecretary for management at DHS, has been tasked with figuring out how to distribute the CBP masks, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly. Alles did not respond to a request for comment.

13407,KingNickSA,"Part of the problem is that protection is only as useful as the procedures surrounding them and what this translates to is that for most of the general population, a face-mask is only useful if you are already sick to help prevent spread. Otherwise, a mask is mostly useless and not available to being used where it is needed. For clarification, the only fully effective masks are thought to be N95 masks and they need to be limited to medical professionals [\[1\]](https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-mask#when-how-to-use). The other masks that most people seem to be wearing might be marginally helpful but STAYING AT HOME and NOT TOUCHING YOUR FACE/WASHING YOUR HANDS will do orders of magnitude more to prevent the spread.

Two I will admit anecdotal examples I saw at Walmart on Mon afternoon:

One was an older couple, prob late 60's or early 70's wearing face masks and gloves which for their age group is understandable. As they are leaving they were packing the car in the parking lot and I see the man pull his phone out as he gets in the seat with his gloves still on. At that point the gloves became useless and he just transferred any potential germs from the gloves used in the store to his phone. While, not a huge deal, to me it emphasizes that most precautions the ""general public"" take outside of the general guidelines to STAY AT HOME as much as possible and DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE/WASH YOUR HANDS CONSTANTLY, are mostly placebo in nature.

The other example I saw that actually angered me was a woman in her 60's shopping with a N95 mask sitting on her head like a pair of reading glasses while talking to someone right next to her in an isle. Full PPE such as N95 masks needs to be limited to medical professionals as shortages start to occur and when you remove PPE after using it, no-matter the length of time, it becomes functionally useless, hence the shortage, as PPE is generally one use items.",1585323330,flnpex0

So most already have masks to start wearing immediately, meaning they had plenty of masks, and it was socially acceptable to wear them.

Please do not believe this as actually true. China at a minimum is probably under reporting the totals by an order of magnitude.

13483,brunomchd1994,"Looking at the number of positive tests per state, we realize that 75% of cases are in 25% of the states (Pareto principle apparently). If this principle is correct, 40% of cases are concentrated in 1.5% of the territory. Therefore, testing only 1.5% of the population (it would not be exactly that but in that order of magnitude) it is possible to reduce the transmission of the virus by 40%. Lockdown measures seem to reduce the transmission of the virus by 35% per day to around 5% per day, which prevents the number of infected people from multiplying by 65 in 14 days, but still increases it by 50% every 14 days (1-1.05¹⁴ = 1). This is because the lockdown appears to have an efficiency of 85% of a perfect quarantine. If 90% efficiency were achieved, the number of infected would drop by almost every 14 days (1–1.035¹⁴ = 0.6). Doing the massive tests and lockdown simultaneously, the country would have a 50% reduction in the number of infected people every 14 days. If the tests are repeated after these 14 days in the new 1.5% of the population, in 14 days of continuation of the lockdown the number of infected people will drop another 80% (1–1.017¹⁴ = 0.2). If the same process is repeated once more, the number of infected people will drop another 90%. In another 14 days and massive tests it will drop 95%, and then 98%, reaching zero cases for an initial number of infected from 20,000 to 100,000. In other words, the virus would be defeated in 70 days, requiring 3 million new tests every two weeks (which would cost R $ 1.5 billion), and the number of deaths would not exceed 200 across the country. Asian countries managed to identify most of those infected with massive tests and other monitoring measures that only exist there, today they hardly register new cases or deaths and are more concerned with preventing the entry of infected people into the country. These countries did not take full quarantine measures as in Italy because of this high capacity to find infected people in the population. European countries, on the other hand, had to opt for the lockdown to contain the virus, but this measure only extends the epidemic by reducing mortality, it does not defeat the virus as in the case of Asian containment strategies. This measure combining mass tests following the Pareto principle and lockdown seems to me to make some sense at this point and be the best possible solution outside of Asia.

13486,KingNickSA,"That is dependent on two things though. First, that there are enough masks for everyone, or at least, more than enough for medical personal when there is a shortage pretty much across the board atm. Second, that also relies on a large portion of the population doing so to ""significantly reduce the odds of them spreading the virus"" as confirmed cases are thought to be only 50% of current infected. In a population as large as the US, especially with all the mixed messages between the news and government recommendations, that simply isn't feasible. 

While, it does reduce the odds of unintentionally spreading the disease. The only way to 100% guarantee that you will not get it is to guarantee that you have not come in contact with it. As I have repeated several times, STAYING AT HOME and   NOT TOUCHING YOUR FACE/WASHING YOUR HANDS CONSTANTLY, are the best and most foolproof methods of preventing the spread and these simple steps are having a hard time getting people to follow them.

Given Asia's general higher population density, I would guess that masks would have a greater effect as well.

The *entire point* of the lockdown was because people weren't taking the social distancing seriously. Many still arent.

Also, have you not heard about the shortage of masks? Hospitals and medical facilities barely have enough masks as is, what makes you think we can get enough masks for everyone to wear all the time?

I'd also like to see some sources that say wearing a mask will prevent you from catching the virus. Everything I've heard up until now indicates that simply wearing a mask will NOT protect you from the mask. Unless youre talking about a full face shield which is even less practical.

(predictions where 3-4% on the low side) . In perspective .2 to 1% is the death rate for the common flu. If this gets over 1% then hospital system gets over whelmed.

Knowing of me and knowing me is not the same thing. 
I will bet real world cash you don’t actually know me. We have never gone anywhere together and I would almost bet we haven’t had more than 1 conversation. 
I know that because you have me about as wrong as it gets. 
I do go way out of my way to help people pretty well constantly. Well people who need help due to no fault of their own or a simple mistake. 
I do not help users and abusers of the system. 
People who fit that criteria do not like me because I will call them in their BS and send them on their way. 
Also if you attack me in any way I will no longer help in any way! 

Now I do self promote certain things to get attention for my business. 
But I always do way more than what I advertise or tell people. 
A good example was the car we gave away for free. 
I advertised 1 we gave away 3! 
Well technically 2 cars and a moped. 
But that’s neither here nor there! 

Your clearly a Vindictive person, which is why you #1 misrepresented my add horribly to make it look like something it wasn’t! 
#2 wont use your real name or contact me so we can work out any issues. 
You just want to misrepresent me and bash my business from a dark corner hiding behind a fake name! 
So you go ahead and keep being you! 
Keep being a fake critic of anyone who tries to do good. 

I’ll keep being me, as long as I am able I will help others. 
But quite frankly I did the toilet paper give away thing to try and get attention for my now failing business! 
We were doing great then this virus stopped the car sales business flat in its tracks right after I bought a bunch of cars. 
When my floor plan runs out in about 30 days The company will seize my remaining inventory and close my business. 

Thanks to my wife’s couponing addiction.  I had plenty of extra toilet paper and sanitizer that’s why I said name brand would very because we’ve had this stuff for months sitting in the pantry. 

I tried to leverage that for attention to sell enough cars to stay in business. 
That plan failed! 
I gave the TP away for free anyway. 
But didn’t sell a single car. 
At this point I have them all prices at my cost because I’m not trying to profit I am just trying to get the cars off the floor-plan before they close me down. 
This is the only way I feed my family of 6. 
It’s also where I get the resources to give to others. 
So yes I am worried about all this! 

I was simply Trying everything in my power to keep my business alive. If you think that’s a bad thing your beyond help. 

Again I don’t see how giving a product away for free becomes a bad thing! 

If you want to actually talk to me call me or talk to me. 
I’ll be happy to talk to you, I am actually very easy to get along with! 

If you had actually talked to me you might learn something about me, you would learn I am not the guy you think I am. 
Although I did appear that way to customers who got their cars repoed from me. That’s one of the reasons I don’t do BHPH anymore. 
I never collected from some people because they were in legitimate trouble so I simply canceled their debt. 
Others were users of the system and I chased them down and got court orders to pay and More. 
I treat people accordingly. 

Whatever happened to make you hate me so much I am sorry. 

I would bet however it wasn’t personally between us.

Husband goes to work and comes home.
We take walks around the neighborhood.
That's all we do in public anymore lol I am so bored. 


Why ? Because I'm not a medical expert, the ones that are are telling me this is the best and possibly only way to save lives right now. I can give up one year of my social life to help slow the spread as not to overwhelm the hospitals (and remember, if they are overwhelmed not only with Covid kill more patients but other medical conditions will get lesser care as well and people will die from other treatable things not because the doctors and nurses don't care but they won't be able to manage care effectively). Hopefully we get a vaccine sooner than later.

We’ve been mostly homebound since Saturday, March 14 except for two harrowing trips to the grocery, a few quick takeout food runs, and several trips to my elderly parents’ (81 and 76) house 1.5 miles away to deliver groceries and chat briefly.

Been keeping Grubhub and DoorDash in business. And we are both fortunate enough to have office jobs that transition well to work-at-home. Our jobs both have work from home orders until April 7 in accords with Holcomb’s showdown order. But rumor is they, and Holcomb, will be extending those orders until May 4. And we’re prepared for that.

Our biggest concern is, of course, our parents. Our dad has a host of underlying conditions (thankfully none pulmonary) and immunosuppression. So they’re adhering to the shutdown and physical distancing even more than we are. Indiana is projected to hit its case and daily fatality peak on or around April 14, and a reasonable scenario for a return to relative normalcy by May 15-20. So we’re prepared for that timeline.

I see way more traffic around than I’d like. Grocery trips are maddening due to almost no one even attempting good physical distancing practice. But my County (Bartholomew) still only has 7 confirmed cases, even though I think it’s safe to assume 10x-20x that exist.

 Any number of factors would help the situation by orders of magnitude, but they mostly fall into the hypothetical or ""would'a, could'a, should'a"" category and therefore have no use in the common discussion. Give me one study or verified source that says masks have less than a 50% difference in effectiveness vs social distancing/isolation, and I will agree with you. But ignoring the facts  (shortage and the debated efficacy of anything less than an N95 mask) does nothing more than give people something to fixate on, worry about, and debate when  STAYING AT HOME and NOT TOUCHING YOUR FACE/WASHING YOUR HANDS are the most important and simplest things everyone can do in the crisis and is considered by most experts, to be the #1 thing people should be doing to create the biggest impact on flattening the curve.",1585427178,flrsxha

Only one other person besides the cashier was there shopping. That was last Saturday, so I have no idea what it’s like now.

13984,sla963,"I am not a doctor, and talking to a doctor would be your best solution.  However, having (probably) had COVID-19 last week, and after having read a lot of people's descriptions of their symptoms, I offer the following questions to help people speculate about their PAST illness (if you have a CURRENT illness, call your doctor!):

1. **Did it progress in waves** \-- you had one symptom, it would go away, you had a completely different symptom, it would go away, etc?  I had four distinct waves of different symptoms over a week.  They came fast and often left fast -- for example, my runny nose lasted about six hours.  One of the cruise ship victims reported a high fever that lasted only a few hours.  If the answer is yes, you had waves (both waves of different symptoms and waves of feeling bad versus feeling well), then maybe you did have COVID-19.  If your illness behaved normally -- you felt a few small symptoms, they got worse, they changed a bit in location but were generally the same, and then they eased off and disappeared over time -- then the answer is probably no, it wasn't COVID-19.
2. **Did it go into your lungs** so that you had trouble breathing normally?  I had a mild case but even I had to breathe carefully and deeply for a couple of days.  It was most definitely and obviously in my lungs.  If the answer is yes, then maybe you did have COVID-19.  If the answer is no, then it was probably something else.
3. **Did it come on quickly or slowly** \-- COVID-19 has a long incubation period and flu has a shorter one.  If you think you got COVID-19 from someone two days before you showed your own symptoms, it's barely possible that it was COVID-19, but it's much more likely that you caught the flu.  The average incubation period for COVID-19 is five days.  One reason I'm fairly sure my illness was COVID-19 is that I showed symptoms after I'd gone into self-quarantine for several days.
4. **Did you give it to someone else, and if so, what were their symptoms** \- COVID-19 is infectious.  If you had it, did you give it to anyone else that you know of?  What were their symptoms like?  Even if your COVID-19 symptoms were unusual and didn't fit the pattern, it's unlikely that you AND the other victim(s) ALL had unusual symptoms.
5. **When did you have it** \-- If you think you had COVID-19 back in Nov 2019, the chances are astronomically high against it.  A month ago?  Probably it wasn't COVID-19, but maybe.  Now?  Very possibly.  COVID-19 has spread, so the more recent your illness is, the more likely it is to be COVID-19. 

My experience is that COVID-19 behaves weirdly.  People seem to think it's like a terrifyingly bad flu, but it's not like the flu at all.  The flu hits you, you suffer, and then it wanes -- all in one long bout of illness.  COVID-19 hits in waves.  For example, by the time it hit my lungs, I had just about no other symptoms.  I wasn't feverish, I was barely coughing, my throat and nose were clear, I actually felt pretty good ... except I needed to breathe deeply to get enough air.  Yes, I had a mild case, but it was utterly and completely *weird*.  

However, even if you're *sure* you had it, I'd still play it safe and continue to behave as if you hadn't.  For one thing, we're not sure yet about immunity.  For another thing, if people see you walking around and failing to take precautions, they'll think you're an asshole covid-denier who might infect them.  If a covid-denier sees you brushing off the possibility of getting infected, maybe he'll feel emboldened to do the same thing.  Probably it's best to play it safe and take precautions even if you're 99% sure you've had it.  

And if you've read this whole long post because you're trying to self-diagnose your current illness?  Just call your doctor and report your symptoms; that's the best way to get a reliable answer.  With luck there will even be a test available for you now, and you can get a DEFINITE answer (both whether you have it, and if so, when you recover from it).  Absolutely the best approach, both for yourself and for everyone else suffering through this pandemic.",1585492962,flu1cym

Idk how they are updating the model but by the original metrics of the study we crossed the threshold on March 16th and should have all 4 measure in place by March 23rd. It's a week later than that and we still havent put the 4th measure in place.

14450,cand86,"From [Dr. Daniel Grossman](https://twitter.com/DrDGrossman/status/1242813643479232513):

&gt;*What about the argument about banning abortion saves personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and gowns? It’s important to recognize that if a pregnant person continues their pregnancy, they end up using a lot more gloves, gowns, and masks than with abortion.  Patients have a couple of pelvic exams and ultrasounds during prenatal care, all of which require gloves, and then use multiple sterile gloves and other PPE during delivery—even more with a c-section.*

&gt;*Here’s what a first-trimester abortion in a clinic requires in terms of PPE: 2 pairs of gloves (1 for the ultrasound and 1 for the procedure) and a reusable face shield. A gown and mask are not usually required.  That’s it.  You can’t tell me that cancelling abortions is going to free up enough PPE for hospitals considering the scale they're requesting.*

&gt;*If this were really about preventing COVID-19 and saving PPE—not about banning abortion—government agencies would encourage the use of telemedicine to provide the abortion pill. Telemedicine [can be used safely and effectively to provide the abortion pill](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28885427).  Medication abortion can be safely provided without requiring most patients to have an ultrasound or blood tests. @RCObsGyn [just issued guidelines](https://rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/2020-03-21-abortion-guidance.pdf) for abortion during the pandemic, basing the assessment on patient history. Ultrasound is used when necessary. During the pandemic, it would be possible to provide medication abortion through 11 weeks of pregnancy without an in-person visit &amp; by mailing pills to a patient. This would reduce the patient &amp; clinician’s risk of acquiring the virus, and not a single piece of PPE would be used.*",1585623237,flzgoo3

I read the IndyStar article about all the restaurants that are afraid they won't make it through, and that really freaked me out. The communities near me (some in Ohio, because I live right on the line) rely very heavily on small businesses and have had fairly decent rebounds over the past couple of years with new places opening up. I'm so afraid if we keep choking those businesses to death during all of this, that we're going to go back to empty storefronts and buildings everywhere and erase every bit of progress that's been made. We need people to be smart about this. Limit exposure if you can and take all the precautions you can if you need to go out.

This, to me, is a gross misuse of government authority. Holcomb is essentially playing a game with lives, bargaining that the lives saved with PPE gear in Covid hospitals will conteract the lives saved in abortion clinics. This, I feel, is an unethical call to make, especially citing the very limited amount of PPE gear actually used by an abortion clinic on a day-to-day basis.

If youth don't clearly understand how pregnancy and sex works then they may engage in sexual activity and get pregnant more often. Your assertion is that youth simply must abstain because YOU know that you cannot get pregnant without engaging in sex.  However...

Your belief fails to take into account the VAST amount of mis-information that comes along with the conservative take on sex education. I engage regularly with youth who think that they can't get pregnant if: 

* They don't WANT to...
* Their body rejects pregnancy certain days/times....
* Their partner pulls out...
* If they have a certain body temperature...
* Are sexually abused by a parent or caregiver because they are family

This comes almost exclusively from youth with conservative or religious backgrounds. Yes, technically you cannot get pregnant without sex. True. But you don't understand that many youth who live in conservative families do not have the right information OR access to contraceptives. And...they keep those belief into adulthood. And...those people have kids when they cannot adequately care for them...And the cycle repeats.

When pro-life folks say they want to stop abortions are they talking about the 1-3% of rape, incest, danger to mother's life, or baby development issues? No. But you keep bringing it to that because there is no sensible justification for the remaining cases. 

You're dishonest if you think pro-lifers are dumb and intellectually lazy if you keep bringing it back to the small number of cases mentioned.

14824,HomeBrewThis,"Sensible justification for an abortion is exactly what I brought up. Poverty, abuse, neglect as a cultural pattern that inhibits youth development are a good justification to have an abortion. Developmental issues, life of the mother, and rape/incest are even better reasons for an abortion. 

You think it's ""clear"" but it is not. Data shows that youth understanding of healthy sexuality is not clear, especially in conservative or religious households. The same is true of medical facts around pregnancy. In fact every justification conservatives make for the ""life"" of a child boils down to a religious one. 

The conservative justification for keeping a baby rests on your faith. Not fact, and not science. They feel it. They believe it. It's the ""common sense"" argument that fails so often. Sex means pregnancy, that's common sense! Of COURSE it's a person. That's common sense! 

I'm not going to convince you against your faith.

Edit: And to address your assertion that I think conservatives are ""intellectually lazy""...that's not what I said or implied. Research shows that conservatives place what they believe to be true over what can be objectively proven to be true. They also tend to teach that onward to their children.

Trump has enacted laws to allow him to do this because of a crisis (not saying he is in the wrong for that, every president would do this). Stronger restrictions aren’t always a bad thing it simply depends on what the end goal is. Also government systems are different from how economics and corporations act. The European socialist countries that are idolized by Bernie and his followers are still capitalistic. However American capitalism and how our laws control what businesses can and can’t do are different from those of Europe. 

I realize that are people who don’t always make the distinction and they go around spewing death to capitalism as if socialism is the better alternative but in reality it’s not and anyone who has done even a small amount of research into the main candidates running would see that capitalism is still the model for all of them. Bernie, who is the furthest left, seeks more government involvement with a safety net for citizens and hopes increase the standard of living through governmental means. On the flip side somebody like Trump would seek to do it through individualistic means. I hope that this person wasn’t just one who spews death to capitalism for no reason. 

If they person who wrote this is someone who doesn’t spew nonsense. I assume doing away with the capitalism as a whole was not the intention. I think what person was trying to say (I hope) was the American version of capitalism is failing. We have huge corporations essentially screwing people over. All these companies are against paying taxes, they find loopholes, they want deregulation of their industries, they do everything to bust up unions/organization, they donate huge sums for political campaigns, they move away from America for cheaper labor or register in another county for lower taxes and environmental regulation, they want to keep wages low if they employ Americans, the list goes on and on. However when this virus hits and hurts *everyone* they’re the first ones in lines seeking government assistance. Then when they get it they give bonuses to CEO’s and buy their stocks back. They don’t seek to help their employees at all. The money was to keep the business afloat not make a profit. I get helping industries with tax money. I don’t think we should let them collapse but at some point we have to step back and question things. We’re giving some corporations a lot more than they give us and I’m not talking in strictly taxes or monetary earnings. This is the kind of stuff that causes people to doubt American capitalism because it’s driven by greed. There is a reckless disregard for many things because of greed.

15023,GuyInNoPants,Stick to getting your news concerning the virus from the CDC.  They make these great little posters with pictures and small words.  Are you seriously asking how coughing is related to breathing?,1585758158,fm4ozkr

15031,TommyBugati,"We will see if a million dead from incompetent leadership and a faulty medical system can change that. Either could catch COVID and die as well.

Also your attitude is one of the big reasons why America sucks. Less than 30% of possible voters voted for the incompetent bubbler. Maybe instead of disparaging people, you could encourage those in your sphere to take part and responsibility for the democratic process. Then you could be part of the solution rather than being part of the problem. Or at least just stay out it, so your do nothing attitude doesn't infect anyone else.",1585758836,fm4qa9u
15032,Tyraniboah89,"Some of the comments in this thread are a prime example of the effectiveness of right wing disinformation campaigns. 

Before we bash democratic socialist proposals and safety nets, maybe be consistent in your beliefs and stop supporting the democratic socialist institutions in place already. Don’t apply for unemployment or food stamps, don’t apply for Medicare or Medicaid, don’t take the stimulus money, take those “blue lives matter” stickers off of your car windows, send your kids to private school, don’t claim social security when you get old, don’t use public roads, and stop saying you support the troops.",1585759101,fm4qsvg

15037,Tyraniboah89,"We already have a strong centralized government, and our economic system is already **heavily** socialist. What do you think the enormous handouts to corporations are? Trump’s tax plan was all about wealth redistribution *towards the top*. What do you think public schooling is? The police, firefighters, and military? How about unemployment and Medicaid/Medicare? We are already where you fear we are, in terms of a strong central government with socialist tendencies. The only thing these people want to change is where that money is going. I.E. The handouts to the wealthy need to be curbed or stopped entirely, and in lieu of that, the money needs to better benefit the people that are working tooth and nail to generate it.",1585759618,fm4rs82

15041,Alford513,"Not exactly sure what you're trying to say there. I mean I get what you mean but DemSoc is just a kind of socialism, with a (contemporary) focus on electoral politics, reforms, and a historical aspect of opposing marxism-leninism. Socialism is just the umbrella term here. As for communism, depends on who you'd ask it means either a stateless, moneyless, classless society or just interchangeable with socialism.",1585760135,fm4srqw

15043,11teh11,"The asymptomatic carriers are pretty much the death knell for meaningful prevention measures. If people feel okay they will go out, period. That's just how people are. Banning large gatherings and closing businesses will slow it a bit, but if half of infected people are spreading with no indicator that they're infected, it's all fucked.",1585760385,fm4t98w
15044,11teh11,"It's a hammer and sickle. This isn't ""democratic socialism"" (btw, lol, if you have to specify democratic, that means socialism is by default totalitarian) it's communism.",1585760452,fm4tdoq
15045,Tyraniboah89,"The fact that it’s all just under some umbrella term *is* the problem. Authoritarian socialism a la Venezuela or Fidel Castro’s Cuba is viewed in the same light as what Bernie proposes, or what’s in some European countries.",1585760452,fm4tdqb

I'm still working 6 day weeks, though a few of our customers have shutdown due to covid so we're down to 8 hour days. I know of a few business's around me that are closed, but Noone I know personally is following it. I work in the RV industry and were still working, so somehow people must still be buying RVs, so RV distributors and sellers must still be open.",1585760948,fm4ubeh
15050,cad870,"I'm half Korean, born &amp; raised in Indiana and this just adds another layer of worry (besides the obvious virus). I haven't experienced racism since I was younger and when I go out (to walk my dog) or sparingly to the store, I will wear a baseball cap and keep my head low because it takes me back to what I experienced as a child.

They don't own or drive cars themselves, but increasingly families are hiring drivers to take their children to school if it's not in walking distance because they feel it's a safer option than using the horse and buggy (having grown up in an area that had a significant Amish community and seeing how drivers often react to buggies, this is 100% a valid concern)

They're not Pentecostals, they're not JWs, they're not CCS.  They happily see doctors, and go to hospitals when needed. They'll ride in ambulances. They may not always accept the prescribed treatment, but that usually has more to do w/thinking about allocation of communal resources (they refuse insurance and so have to come up with payment entirely within the community) than a categorical rejection of modern medicine. They don't own or drive cars themselves, but increasingly families are hiring drivers to take their children to school if it's not in walking distance because they feel it's a safer option than using the horse and buggy (having grown up in an area that had a significant Amish community and seeing how drivers often react to buggies, this is 100% a valid concern)

They keep a phone around for emergency use, and many will use cell phones for business purposes. They participate in capitalist markets. Many of them will keep a generator (or, nowadays, solar panels) around to power devices needed to comply with food safety requirements (this has been a major point of dispute in many communities, and not all communities have come down the same way on it, but the point is that it was an open, debatable question).

Increasingly, they vote.

They travel long distances when needed or occasionally even just for pleasure, usually by train though if time is of the essence or there is an ocean crossing involved then by plane as well.

It is the case that counties with significant Amish populations tend to be largely rural in general, and so they have the same issues that rural counties in general are seeing with testing (but also the benefits of lower population density), but there's nothing specifically Amish about that.",1585764321,fm51018

15099,gitsgrl,"&gt;How the fuck do you not show systoms?

There are lots of viruses that can be transmitted without showing symptoms (eg. HIV and other STIs are most notable/talked about- until now). The virus is living and replicating in your body but there is no reaction. COVID-19 is the illness caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus. These carriers have the virus but are not showing signs of the illness.

&gt;Can the virus be spread by just breathing on soneone?

Yes! The virus can be carried up to 27' and linger for hours in the air.  [http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2020.4756](http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2020.4756)

&gt;What does coughing have to do with it?

It is one of they symptoms (for people exhibiting symptoms) and coughing sprays air/droplets around more than regular breathing. But people can carry the virus, not show symptoms, and still infect others because regular breathing exhales air and vapor from inside your lungs that carry the virus that is replicating inside you.",1585765800,fm53rsk

15112,The_One_X,"One of the things that I have never liked about the reporting about this virus is the focus on the amount of deaths. The danger of this virus was never how deadly it was. While it is more deadly than the flu, it is still not a super deadly disease by percentage. The real danger of this virus has always been how easily it transmits between people. This is something that people have not realized because the media was always too focused on the amount of deaths it causes. 

If it had an infection rate similar to the flu it wouldn't be a big deal, it would just be a very bad flu, but it wouldn't overwhelm hospitals. With hospitals not being overwhelmed the vast majority of people would get proper treatment, and the mortality rate would be a lot lower. With such a high infection rate, though, this results in overwhelmed hospitals which results in higher mortality rates. 

If the focus was on how infectious this virus was maybe we could have been better prepared for it, and places like New York, New Orleans, and Spain would not have treated it as a low risk situation and cancelled their parades and festivals.",1585767950,fm57vra

Raising the prices of the products will often result in people only buying what they need instead of hoarding supplies.

So, in that vein hate crimes can take on many dimensions.. act of social terror.  Person X didn’t simply beat up a gay person, they intended to send a message to the gay community.

Add to that, ever hear how fair the trials of white person/white jury was versus black person/white jury?.. especially in the south?  Yeah, so the feds have added hate crime to their repertoire for when local justice is frankly complete injustice.

So I would agree that in a just and unbigoted society hate crimes and protected groups wouldn’t be necessary.  But, because they’re are too many people who act and behave completely based on ignorant bigotry they’ve “forced” society to create these laws.

I also hold that simply having a child be born without any interest in the outcome or responsibility of that child's life beyond it leaving the birth canal is morally corrupt at best. Evil at worst. That is a scientific OR moral argument. It can be had without faith at all. 

The unborn are not people. They are not a person scientifically or conceptually. In fact, the religious belief that life begins at ""conception"" is relatively new. For a very long time it was the formation of the heart that made a person, and before that the ""breath of life"" upon birth made a person. Those are also all...***religious*** arguments. And further, conservatives only agree on this perception of personhood (at conception most recently) ***until*** they are asked to pay benefits or taxes on those unborn ""people"". When you bring money into the picture, their absolute faith in personhood of the unborn evaporates. 

Personally, I think abortion can be a difficult decision that has serious consequences. Some consequences may be negative. But data and study upon study continue to show that abortion availability, positive sexual health education, and an understanding of contraception all have WAY more benefits than forced parenthood. Both on the individual and society. We can rely on science as far as your'd like, I'm happy to cite my sources. However, I am a youth worker and I can see it, every day, with my own eyes the benefits abortion has provided and the need for active healthy sex education.

This is semantic, and it's absolutely NOT true. Nationalization is a form of socialism! Iran has a socialized healthcare industry, america has socialized K-12, and England has socialized helathcare.

You're not doing yourself any favors by harping on this point. 

If ""nationalized ownership"" is NOT socialism, than I guess the USSR wasn't a socialist country. 

&gt; You can't analyze a specific industry in a bubble secluded from the rest of an otherwise capitalist state.

You ABSOLUTELY can, just like you can analyze specific private bubbles that exist in China under an otherwise communist state.

This entire exchange is getting tedious and pedantic, becuase you don't want to discuss the merits of socialist policies, you want to debate language and make these baseless definitions of nebulous terms.

I'm sorry, but I won't let you do that becuase it's not really helping anything. If you want to have a conversation, let's do it, but if you start that conversation with a bunch of forced, limiting definitions...then what's the point?

&gt; What about the people who are not legal citizens?

That's not a conversation of socialism, that's a conversation about borders and the social contract. 

&gt; What about the overseas exploited labor on which developed countries rely? Common ownership means common ownership not national, or majoritarian.

That's not a conversation about socialism, it's a conversation about globalization, trade, and neoliberalism....these are tangential, but not directly related to the debate at hand. 

&gt; I'm making an argument not to ""win an argument"" but to reject the notion that social welfare programs define socialism and hence what socialists want.

HERE WE ARE FINALLY! This is what I was trying to pull out of you. I agree, which is why scholars generally differentiate between ""socialism"" and ""democratic socialism.""  But that doesn't mean that democratic socialism ISN'T socialism, it's just a watered down version of it. Democratic socialism is supposed to be the fix, it's the controls that capitlaism requires to fix its faults (supposedly).

The thing is, a lot of socialists DO *just* want meager fixes and bandaid, they want to just nationalize a few industries, leaving the mechanisms of the capitalist system largely in place. 

...and the thing is, despite how much I agree with you (im a libertarian-socialist, myself), I just want to help as many poor Americans as possible (especially black Americans), and the quickest and most practical way of doing that would be to nationalize our healthcare industry and eliminate student debt.",1585839170,fm7y862

15429,Chief_SquattingBear,"Sentience is a fairly controversial means to determine value of life. 

But even with a basic definition, scientifically an unborn person is capable of those aspects. If you wouldn’t agree with that, then what’s the difference between an unborn person and a born person other than location and aesthetic?

Also, homogeneity is a poor argument for personhood. Referring to a person as a cluster of cells is applicable at all aspects of a person’s life. Right now you are a cluster of cells. Very unique cells that are unlike any other organism and a zygote or a blastocyst are simply developmental stages in the lifespan of a human. Infants look significantly different than adults, but they are still people. 

Every time you take those unique cells and allow them to develop, you will get what you call a person. They don’t develop into a vestigial organ, they’re not a tumor, or a parasite, but again, a person at a different developmental stage. 

This will boil down to whether or not you want to accept the unborn are people. It’s arguable, but I’m going with the developmental science in saying this is a human.

Also, it doesn’t matter how a person is treated, they’re still a person. I agree not taking care of vulnerable people is wrong, but that doesn’t mean it’s ok to kill someone to avoid hardship.",1585844401,fm87sc3

15603,muirshin,"This is an incorrect reading of the data. But I want to explain why because it is happening a lot. First the problem is that the data itself doenst mean anything.  900 cases, 3000 cases, none of that has any real meaning on it's own. The time frame is meaningless as well. Also the only thing this does help to show is that exponential growth is not happening. Again this is because the numbers don't mean what they first appear to mean. 

Let's start with the first day (day 1) in this data set. Day 1 has 981 confirmed cases, 24 deaths, and 6,936 tests. If you look at only the confirmed cases and compare that to the last day in this data set (day 7), 3,039 cases, it does appear that over a 7 days you have had a nearly 310% growth. That would be pretty alarming. The problem is that this is entirely false, for many reasons. The number of test being administered, the population of the data set, the unknown day 0 quantities, even just knowing how many are new cases versus newly identified cases would make this better. The one thing this data set is good at showing is the value of confirmed vs tested. 
So for day1 we have a value of 14.14% confirmed of tested. At day 7 this value is 18.66%. So in 7 days we have have a confirmed to tested rate increase of 4.52%. This is a far cry from 310% when not reading the data correctly. Still though this has issues because again. This is not explaining if these are new cases or just newly identified cases. To more accurately understand what is happening you would need to start with a date and only factor in new cases where symptoms were noted after the start date. Doing this you would be able to get a real understanding of the growth rate. Also 16,285 tests is a poor population size for a state of 6.8 million. It is only 0.23% of the population. Not large enough to make any determination of the greater population. 

Sorry this is long but is see this issue a lot. This data as interesting as it looks, and even with it being accurate is basically useless ,and that is a lot of the problem. We don't have a good idea of what is actually going on. Not nearly enough to draw any real conclusions from.

15609,The_One_X,"Actually, these numbers tell us very little about where we are. You have to consider that these numbers are only the publicly reported numbers. These numbers lag behind the confirmed cases by at least a day, maybe as much as 5 days. Then it also takes time before people become sick enough to go get tested which can add another 5+ days to the lag time. Add to that we are playing a lot of catch-up with old cases. We are probably still 5 to 10 days away from seeing the effects of our mitigations showing up in data.

15616,The_One_X,"&gt; As difficult as it might be for so many people (financially and in terms  of self-discipline), we probably do need a much more strict lockdown 

This may seem counter intuitive, but going into a stricter lockdown is a bad idea. You cannot stay in lockdown indefinitely, you have to let people get sick and recover from the virus. Otherwise as soon as you exit lockdown you have another outbreak on your hands. The only hope to stopping outbreaks of coronavirus are herd immunity. Until we have a vaccine, which is still a long way off, the only way to build that herd immunity is through people getting sick and recovering. You just want to do it at a rate that does not overwhelm hospitals.

At best, a lockdown is just biding your time until you can have an actual solution (i.e. enough masks for everyone). At worst it is a misguided attempt by politicians who feel like they have to do something, but were too incompetent to actually be prepared for the inevitable.",1585866632,fm9dp26

Development is exactly what I am talking about. Those cells fall along a line of development that may one day reach personhood. In the meantime they not sentient,  are fully reliant on a host, and incapable of independence. The best actual person to make decisions on what happens to that developing cluster is the mother. 

The reasons for aborting the development of those cells are wide and varied. The reasons can include knowledge that there will be developmental decline, death/harm of the mother, or disability. Another reason may be that any person that MAY develop will be uncared for, abused, or neglected. The healthiest time for those difficult decisions are early and the mothers choice alone. 

Why? Because this may not be not a religious decision. It may have moral implications for the mother personally but it is nobody else’s choice but hers. Developmental science does not consider those cells people, they are not the unborn. To say otherwise is incorrect. We could argue “potential” life all day long. Masturbation? Wrong because it’s all potential wasted! Donating eggs? Wasted potential! Stem cell research? Wrong! That was a potential person! It’s all horseshit, unless you have a religious stake in the game. 

I think everyone agrees that potential exists. But until that potential is realized through birth or viability the choice to have an abortion is healthiest and best made by a mother. At NO TIME should personhood be determined by someone’s religious beliefs, something that is as wide and varied as all the people on this earth.",1585868912,fm9hm8v

Religious schools don’t adhere to educational standards (or facts at all, honestly), and they are heavily discriminatory in their admissions. For-profit charter schools often perform **much** worse than their public counterparts, but get excused when they file an appeal to continue receiving taxpayer funded vouchers after two years of D or F grades. 

We’re pushing more money to the wealthy, allowing our kids to receive much worse education, and getting fuck all in return. And it’s because voters **like you** buy into their bullshit narratives about public schooling.

As for schools, even if you don’t have a kid, those schools educate the next generation and people around your community that you live in. Without that community of people you wouldn’t not be where you are today. Idgaf how independent you think you are. You, and everybody else, relies on each other indirectly.

I saw that you think our public school system sucks. It does, however maybe instead of just blaming the teachers blame the system that doesn’t help the teachers. You think maybe the bad schooling has to do with the fact that public school teachers have to use their own money to run their classrooms? Why else do you think kids have to donate supplies at the beginning of every year. Growing up so many of my pencils, expo markers, tissue boxes. Why aren’t these things provided for the teachers? As we saw years ago through some articles that were spread around, some schools show pictures of a microscope because that school can’t afford to buy a single one.

What’s wrong isn’t the fact that they’re taxing us. What’s wrong is where the majority of our money goes. It goes to the military-industrial complex, gas and oil subsidies, farmer subsidies, corporate tax breaks and bailouts. We should be putting more money into education.

Indiana seems like one of the lowest in the u.s. I normally bring in 1200 bi weekly and now I'm getting 235 a week it's a joke. And the fact other states are already getting their $600 add to their weekly benefits seems unfair. And it seems like our governor isnt doing his job to best of his ability. And it seemed like a week/ week and half they said 3 weeks for direct deposit people. Even though 3400 isnt much. I'm not trying to act like a baby. I am grateful we are getting some aid here. Just feel unemployment isnt fairly judged. I work in the motor industry and the keep extending their shut down dates so who knows when we go back?

Tony Sizemore, on the death of Birdie Shelton

Eli SaslowMarch 28, 2020
She’s dead, and I’m quarantined. That’s how the story ends. I keep going back over it in loops, trying to find a way to sweeten it, but nothing changes the facts. I wasn’t there with her at the end. I didn’t get to say goodbye. I don’t even know where her body is right now, or if the only thing that’s left is her ashes.

From normal life to this hell in a week. That’s how long it took. How am I supposed to make any sense of that? It’s loops and more loops.

An oral history of covid-19. First in a series.

She transported cars for a rental company. That’s where all this must have come from. People fly in from somewhere for a meeting and fly out a few hours later. You’ve got germs from all over the world inside those cars. I didn’t like the fact that she was working so hard, 69 years old and still climbing in and out of Ford Fusions all day, driving from Indianapolis to St. Louis and back with bad knees, bad hips, diabetes, and all the rest of it. Sometimes, she hurt so much after work I had to help her out of the car. I guess I should have told her to quit, but nobody told Birdie anything. She liked to drive, and we needed the money.

I think she’d been feeling bad for a few days, but I don’t remember much about what happened early on. She wasn’t a complainer, and I’m not always the best at noticing. There was a cough somewhere in there. Probably a touch of a fever. But this was a few weeks back, when those things didn’t mean so much. I thought she had a cold, or maybe bronchitis. She would get that sometimes, lose her voice and be fine a few days later, no big deal. But then she woke me up at about 4 in the morning and kept pointing to her throat. She said she couldn’t sleep. Said her eyes hurt. Said it felt like somebody was pounding on top of her head. Birdie’s usually one of those who wants to rub some dirt on it and keep moving, so when she told me to take her to the emergency room, I knew it was serious. I knew she was sick.

First it was a fever of 103. Then the doctors decided it was pneumonia and went ahead and admitted her. Then it was pneumonia in both of her lungs. If anybody was thinking it was the coronavirus, I didn’t hear it — at least not at first. Nobody in Indiana had it yet. Even if it was killing people in Washington state and starting to infect people in New York, it was basically happening on TV.

The best precautions weren’t taken in the early stages. A few nurses wore gloves or masks when they came to see Birdie, but that seemed normal for treating pneumonia. I didn’t wear anything, and nobody really asked me to. I was lying next to her in the bed or sitting in a chair and holding her hand. She didn’t have much other family, and if I got up to go out into the hallway for a few minutes, I’d kiss her goodbye.

Would it have gone any different if they knew what it was? Maybe. Or maybe they would have quarantined her right then, and I would have lost a few more days with her.

See, I could analyze this to death. I’ll be doing this for the rest of my life.i",1585961590,fmd8ass

It was hard for me to sit there. I’m almost ashamed to say that, but it’s true. She was in the bed, and I was usually a few feet away in the recliner. It was two or three days in that room, but each one felt like a year. I’m not a natural caretaker, and never claimed to be, but it seemed like no matter what I tried, I couldn’t help her. It was just watch, wait, touch her forehead, apologize. I couldn’t do anything. Nobody could.

She was taking so much oxygen, but it was never enough. She had two little tubes put in her nose, and she couldn’t get enough air. They put a big mask on her face to get her oxygen back up, and that made her claustrophobic and panicky. She got real freaked out. I tried to count breaths with her. I kept saying: “Easy. Easy. In, out. In, out.” I couldn’t distract her because she was so deep in her head with panic. It labored her to talk. It labored her to breathe. I said, “Don’t talk then, honey. Save your energy.” There was a TV in there, but neither of us could focus on it. I sat in the quiet with her, for whatever comfort that might have brought her. I don’t know. I listened to her breathing. I watched her. When she was asleep she was taking these real quick, short breaths, like she was gulping air more than breathing it. When she was awake, she was kind of mumbling to herself. Maybe it was the medication they were giving her. I hope to God it was the medication. She was talking about how her eyes hurt, her insides hurt. She would clutch her fists and hit the bed and stuff, and you don’t really know how to help somebody in that frame. I mean, when she’s just clutching her fists and moaning and — I don’t know. I don’t know what I could have done. I sat there for as long as I could and then I got up every few hours to pace the hallway, or I’d drive eight minutes home to feed the dogs. I was starting to go a little crazy myself. I couldn’t keep sitting there, feeling helpless, listening to her breathe.

It was an awful time. I should be thankful she’s not suffering anymore, but she did suffer some.

It got worse. Her breaths got raspy. Shorter. They put her on life support. They rolled her across the hall one afternoon and tested her for the virus. At some point in there, I went home after midnight to check on the dogs, and when I came back early the next morning there was a sign that said “No Visitors” taped to the door of the hallway that led to her room. The whole thing became confusing to me. They said I couldn’t go in. They said nobody could. I sat in the waiting room for hours. I peeked through the window down the hallway once and saw them moving her to a different room. It looked like she was sleeping with the tube down her throat. The doctor said she was heavily sedated to stay comfortable. I’d like to believe that, but I don’t know if she was comfortable or not.

When they said the test was positive, that’s when I started thinking this virus was a death sentence for her. She had every underlying condition it attacks. Damaged lungs. High blood pressure. Her body wasn’t strong enough. She was lying there waiting to die.

The doctors told me to go home, but I didn’t. Most of the time I sat by the elevators in the waiting room. Nobody else was in there. Sometimes one of Birdie’s friends would come sit with me. The doctors kept saying, “No change.” “No change.” It had been five days now since she’d woken me up pointing at her throat. They sent a chaplain to talk to me. Their voices kind of kept getting softer and softer. Everyone knew what was coming. I was up most nights and sleeping some in the day. My body wore down. I started coughing, and they told me I didn’t have a choice. They said I needed to go home and quarantine.

I walked circles in the house. I’m 62, fairly healthy but not indestructible, and now I’m worrying about Birdie but also about my own mortality. Pretty soon the hospital started calling me to ask about unplugging her. They said her kidneys were shutting down. That it was my decision. I told them: “How can I turn her off without looking at her? I can’t take your word on this. She might be doing jumping jacks for all I know. I need to see her.” That’s when they started talking about setting up a video call, so they could take her off some of the meds and I could say some kind of goodbye.

I’m not a techie. Birdie liked to tease me about that. When I got with her six years ago, I still had a flip phone. She liked going on Facebook, and it kind of pissed me off when she was on her phone all the time. The only friends I have are ones I can see and touch. But now I’m talking on the phone for hours with some nice lady from hospital IT, who’s telling me how to download some kind of app. She asked if I had an iPhone, but I don’t. I found one of Birdie’s old ones, but I didn’t have the password. So now I’m getting frustrated, trying to get this video chat to work on my old Android. The lady said my phone needed to be charged to 50 percent for the video to work, but my phone hasn’t seen 50 percent in two years. It only charges if it’s turned off, so I started turning it off and back on every few hours to check if anyone had been calling about Birdie. And it’s like, you know what, is this really what I should be doing right now? Is this really how I’m supposed to tell her goodbye? Finally the phone gets to 50 and dies out of nowhere. Fifty again but I need some kind of password. I said to hell with it. This isn’t going to work.

The doctor called the next morning. Birdie died at 10:20. So I didn’t have to unplug her, and I didn’t get to see her.

They held a press conference since she was the first to die in Indiana. They said we got to say goodbye over video. I guess it’s a nicer story. I don’t really blame them. I’d like to find a way to sugarcoat this thing, too, but I can’t. Anything good I could say about this would be a lie.

They told me to isolate and stay home for 14 days from the last time I saw her. I’m kind of losing track of how many it’s been. I have some depression issues, and it would be real easy for me to go to bed and pull the covers up over my head. I could bury myself in this thing and let my mind keep running loops. I’m staring at her clothes in the closet. Her curling iron is on the bathroom sink. Her car’s out front that we owe money on. I have no idea what I’m going to do. I don’t know what bills are paid up and what aren’t. She handled most of that. She looked after me in some ways like she cared for everybody, whether she knew you or not. That was always her nature. Anyway. Yesterday afternoon, they cut the power off, but I figured out how to get it back on.

I haven’t eaten much, and it’s probably making me weak. I’m bone tired and coughing like crazy. They called me back to the hospital for a chest X-ray, but the doctors said I looked good. No fever. No trouble breathing. They decided not to even give me a test. They have 12 nurses quarantined over there now and a whole floor of people with the virus, but I got lucky. They told me I’ll be fine.

The problem is most people are illiterate when it comes to statistics, they do not understand what makes a statistic good and what makes a statistic bad. This is a bad statistic because there is absolutely no context, which allows people to use it to forward their preconceived opinion. That can be downright dangerous if it is influencing how people act.

Sweetwater and Sweet Family Team Members, 

We wanted to provide you with an update on our plans for next week.

Throughout this very unique season, we continue to be grateful for all of you who have worked so hard to adjust - especially for those of you who have shifted to working from home and those who have chosen to come in to keep gear moving through our Distribution Center. You are all truly making a difference in people's lives. We are sending equipment to hospitals, teachers, nursing homes, churches, musicians (at their homes and places of business) and families. They use these tools to teach, entertain and communicate with each other. So whether you knew it or not, you are making people's lives brighter and better in these unprecedented times. 

For all of you currently doing your job remotely, we'd like for you to continue to do so through April 20. Please keep staying closely connected with your manager to ensure you have everything you need to be productive and to do excellent work. 

For those employees who have been unable to work remotely, we are asking that you return to work starting on Tuesday, April 7. For some of you that will mean setting up a new remote work situation if your manager approves it and if your work can be productively done from home. For some, such as those working in the Distribution Center, that sill mean reporting back to your regular role. And for a few whose work is not in the DC but cannot be done remotely (like the Retail Store team and others on our campus which will still remain closed to the public), this may mean temporarily taking on a new role for the next several weeks so that you can come back to work. Your manager or department leader will be speaking with you by Monday or sending a separate message to provide additional details about how this impacts you. In all of this, we continue to follow the advice of government and health authorities who recommend allowing for remote work when possible while creating clear ""essential business"" exceptions to the stay-at-home order for ""distribution centers"" and for businesses that sell ""audio and video electronics.""

For those returning back to work at our Distribution Center, we'll soon be sendinf a separate message with additional details - including outlining the many new steps we're taking to help ensure your health and safety during this unprecedented time.

In all cases, we look forward to having our team back in full force caring for each other and serving our customers well. As always, if your have any questions or concerns please speak with your manager or an HR team member. We'll continue to stay in close contact with leading health authorities, will adjust as needed and keep you updated along the way.

16192,JoseMikey,"That blog is scary, especially the name and subtitle, weird sense of humor.

As for the article itself, he forgot when Singapore did it. The strategy used by Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong works when you have very limited cases (Singapore, Taiwan) or slightly more but with a well defined cluster (South Korea)

In The United States and Europe the authorities overslept. While you can try to argument the strategy on a state basis we overslept that too as cases have long bin in all 50 states.

Also, The EU, the borderless Schengen area, closed down or semi closed down borders early. And it didn’t stop the countries with less cases to also explode and their borders, open for say 30 years and between countries are easier to close than our state borders, so isolating some states with stay at home and using the Singapore method in others would also not work.

So while we all like the Singapore strategy, with no lock down, just masks and some social distancing, that could have been implemented in early February, when we already had cases but zero tests.

Last but not least, the dude even did not do his math properly. Did not look at Lombardy and Wuhan. US stay at home orders are new and not in all states. Lockdowns work and do flatten curves. But not so fast.",1585997265,fmeb8sf
16193,MannDude,"Been training for my Appalachian Trail thru-hike that is/was scheduled for later this year, but it's beginning to look as if I'll need to delay it from the scheduled June 15th start date to later into July or even August for my southbound hike.

Usually I do training hikes on the Knobstone, Hoosier National Forest, or other areas of the state. But I wanted to stay local and didn't want to have to stop along the way.

16194,touchmyrick,"I went to the academy and the best way to describe it is college with a curfew. You have to sign out when you leave the building and state where you are going, but for the most part as long as you are back before curfew they dont care what you do. 

It's a big shock and some people couldn't handle it and returned home. They essentially treated you like adults if you in return obeyed the few rules and treated them like adults.

Classes were great, my first semester I had no classes on Thursdays.  It follows college credit hour rules and scheduling. My fiance (who I met at the academy and have been with for the last 6 years), even had a class from 6:30pm-9pm on Tues/Thurs, just to give you an idea of how college-like it is.

To answer your questions from above, my parents weren't crazy by any means, but being away from them prepared me for what life was really like. I was super sheltered in small town indiana, in fact I never met an Asian person before going there. It opened my eyes up to the world and what reality was truly like. 

It's also true that I had almost no friends at my current high school, because I was the loser who didn't play sports and got all A's. My ""friends"" associated with me because I let them copy my homework. I talk to 0 people from my old highschool but my friendgroup I made at the academy is still going strong.

I don't know how money is now, but when I went to the academy it cost 800/semester. (2010 was my graduation year).",1585997699,fmeblp2

We still aren’t doing that in any meaningful way here in Indiana or the US.",1585997968,fmebtqo
16197,T_kash_ham,"I agree with you that the authorities overslept. What is frustrating is that everyone is screaming for more of a lockdown, yet very little is spoken about in regards to getting more tests, which all experts agree is how we ultimately contain this thing. People seem to think that a lockdown will solve everything in 2 weeks time and that is unfortunately just not the case. 
The general public also seems to not realize that a prolonged shutdown increases health risks for those who lose their jobs, impoverishes so much of the citizenry, puts abuse victims at an extremely high risk, harms the homeless as shelters are shut down, has serious implications for mental health and suicide rates, ...the list goes on and on. The point is, this lockdown mentality is not a sustainable solution and something else needs to be done.

I was at Ball State while she was attending so we would meet up and I did my best to support her. Really sweet gal. She later went to IU and ended up doing something in the recording industry. If it is something you want, go for it. The village (area around Ball State) has had a major overhaul so it’s an enjoyable “neighborhood” to be in.

Actually they are getting a raise - 

&gt;  On top of this benefit, unemployed workers will receive an additional $600 per week for dates of unemployment from March 27, the day the CARES Act was signed, until July 31. After that, individuals who are still unemployed will continue to receive their state-administered benefit for the remainder of their 39 weeks.

While it is likely there could be a drug, medical device/procedure, and/or vaccine in the future, some of those could take a minimum of four months, possibly more like twelve or more.  If things stay like they are, herd immunity may never come because it will be too slow gaining the numbers and the immunity may wear off after one or two years.

My advice is to slowly re-open small scale gatherings.  Reopen restaurants for dine-in, but maybe use a calculation of how many people allowed, space them apart, etc..  Large gatherings like pro-sport events, schools, etc. are where we get into trouble.  Tens of thousands of people, some getting drunk depending on the event, not washing hands enough, not wearing a mask, spreading the virus.

16377,MyIndianaLife,"Most of our popular state parks are a drive from some of the urban centers.  I'm wondering if parks like Fort Ben are getting somewhat crowded.  If the inns/buffets are closed, the pools aren't going to open, no shelter renting for family reunions, etc., a good percentage of the normal visitors are not going to visit this year.

I also have some issues with closing the national parks.  There have always been hints of having to reduce traffic and stuff.  While it would take a while, I think blocking off every other parking space at popular trail heads, strict enforcement of overflow parking (tow and ticket vehicles), and restricting visitor entry points would allow for people to use the parks.  If this is going to go on for months, a lotto system would be nice.  Still keep the gift shops, visitor centers, restroom facilities, etc. closed.  That will at least allow for the diehards who aren't just their for an Instagram photo to visit.

At some point in time though, absent a promising treatment, herd immunity will need to be built.  35,000 people in the Great Smoky Mountains NP is vastly different from 70,000 people in Lucas Oil Stadium.  Since rangers won't be working visitor centers, having to clean restrooms, etc., perhaps install some decent shelter shacks at popular trail locations and limit traffic in and out.

Sweetwater and Sweet Family Team Members, 

We wanted to provide you with an update on our plans for next week.

Throughout this very unique season, we continue to be grateful for all of you who have worked so hard to adjust - especially for those of you who have shifted to working from home and those who have chosen to come in to keep gear moving through our Distribution Center. You are all truly making a difference in people's lives. We are sending equipment to hospitals, teachers, nursing homes, churches, musicians (at their homes and places of business) and families. They use these tools to teach, entertain and communicate with each other. So whether you knew it or not, you are making people's lives brighter and better in these unprecedented times. 

For all of you currently doing your job remotely, we'd like for you to continue to do so through April 20. Please keep staying closely connected with your manager to ensure you have everything you need to be productive and to do excellent work. 

For those employees who have been unable to work remotely, we are asking that you return to work starting on Tuesday, April 7. For some of you that will mean setting up a new remote work situation if your manager approves it and if your work can be productively done from home. For some, such as those working in the Distribution Center, that sill mean reporting back to your regular role. And for a few whose work is not in the DC but cannot be done remotely (like the Retail Store team and others on our campus which will still remain closed to the public), this may mean temporarily taking on a new role for the next several weeks so that you can come back to work. Your manager or department leader will be speaking with you by Monday or sending a separate message to provide additional details about how this impacts you. In all of this, we continue to follow the advice of government and health authorities who recommend allowing for remote work when possible while creating clear ""essential business"" exceptions to the stay-at-home order for ""distribution centers"" and for businesses that sell ""audio and video electronics.""

For those returning back to work at our Distribution Center, we'll soon be sendinf a separate message with additional details - including outlining the many new steps we're taking to help ensure your health and safety during this unprecedented time.

In all cases, we look forward to having our team back in full force caring for each other and serving our customers well. As always, if your have any questions or concerns please speak with your manager or an HR team member. We'll continue to stay in close contact with leading health authorities, will adjust as needed and keep you updated along the way.

In Europe, where the epidemic hit earlier it’s done the same way and at present talk about re-starting the economy with the help of masks and tests is staring, as it seems most countries thing that two months is the absolute maximum of lockdown the economy can handle. And we all know that a total economic collapse would mean more victims than the pandemic itself. 

Also the reassessment is a good time to implement changes, for instance what is considered an essential business. Again based on data.

16602,18bbambi,"I attended the Indiana Academy, and graduated two years ago in 2018. There are certainly advantages. It will prepare you for undergrad, make you an independent person, and I deeply cherish the friends I made there and the experiences I had with them. 

However, I suspect that many of the people posting on this thread have not attended the Academy in recent years because the situation seems to have deteriorated rapidly starting with my seniors (the class of 2017.) 

The Academy makes a lot of false promises. If you think attendance at the Acad is your ticket to an Ivy League, you would be sorely mistaken. And graduation from the Academy is not as impressive to colleges as what you might be led to believe. And in recent years, the social environment and atmosphere has gotten progressively worse. (Also the academy will /not/ prepare you for the SAT, there is no kind of SAT prep offered by the Academy and with my heavy coursework load, I felt that I didn't have a lot of time to prep for my SATs.  Frankly, if I did not go to the Academy, I think that my SATs would have been a significantly higher.)

It is a stressful environment, there are a lot of demands that are placed on students inside and out of class. (Like wellness hours, academy service hours, etc.) On top of this students are heavily policed by SLC's and as the years progress there are more and more restrictions with steeper penalties. I have heard from multiple reputable sources that at least a third of the class of 2019 did not return for their senior year because they felt the Academy jeopardized their mental health, and that several wings had to be closed for the 2018-2019 academic year. 

CW: sexual abuse/violence

Since I arrived in 2016 it seems that this has culminated in a very hostile atmosphere between the student body, teaching faculty, and the administration/student life. So much so that while I was there students unionized three times (that I know of.) The last of which involved 50 students and was because of the administration's egregious mishandling of multiple cases of sexual abuse/violence. (The problem was with one particular administrator who is still there, and essentially got a stern talking to.) And many students of color felt that the administration did not care about their needs or concerns and that the Academy created a hostile environment for students of color in particular. This led to the creation of the Latinx Student Alliance and the Black Student Union at the IA.

When I talk to older Alum's it seems that the Academy in its heyday was an exemplary institution. But frankly, I and everyone I know who has graduated from the Academy has mixed feelings. If you generally like your home community, your family, and the school you currently attend offers SAT prep &amp; AP classes, I would say stay where you are.",1586122666,fmj4611
