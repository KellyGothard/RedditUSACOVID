I only mention this because I want to make sure I give her the best visit possible since she's well enough right now to come see me.  It's a short visit.  They will arrive about noon Friday and leave sometime Sunday.  We plan to spend sister time on Saturday just shopping and doing sister stuff.  Her husband will probably go into DC on his own that day.  Sunday I think we may try to do brunch at Le Dip and a museum of their choice before they get on the road. 

My question is about this coming Friday afternoon.  She's a creative and artistic person.  I've gone to a lot of art shows and markets since I got here (example Holiday Market in Penn Quarter last week) and always would think how she'd love seeing see the creativity and artwork at those events.  So, would Eastern Market be a good place to take them after we have lunch at my place?  Or is there some place better?

Before I tried to use them on the bus the first time, I tapped it at the metro station (what I was told to do when I called to see how to load them on my card). Tapping did nothing, so I clicked into a section that looked like it might (I think it was called SmartBenefits or Benefits or Pass or something) - did that a few times on three different machines but it kept cancelling out. Didn't want to miss my bus, so I gave up and just got on the bus without loading. Next morning, still nothing had loaded when I got on the bus. Called and was told just to tap it again (gee, thanks). Next morning, had to take metro (classically, two buses didn't show), and tapped in and out of the metro. Still nothing loaded. Tapped again on bus this morning, and still nothing loaded. Called and was told just to tap it again (so helpful), or to load my own money again and take a ""fake trip"" by tapping in and out of the metro. Since I've already done all of this, I'm doubtful either will work now when it hasn't before. WMATA says they can't load SmartBenefits on their end (which sounds crazy). They also said that my card might be demagnetized if it was near my phone or debit card (which I also find unlikely, as I kept my Charlie/T card in the same phone case as I have now for literally four years nonstop with no issues, and often had my debit/credit and/or ID cards in there with it), but gave no solution other than to buy a new one.

98,_Yeezus_H_Christ,1578006404,ej60do,Nan,"Hello Reddit, 

I‚Äôm in need of some help. My apartment has been without heat since 12/16. I live in a privately owned condo in DC. I contacted the owner of the condo early on 12/16 to inform her of the issue. She contacted the building manager to find out who works on the units in the building. The first available appointment was 12/27. The HVAC tech came out and inspected the unit and told me that it needs to be totally replaced. He also informed me that there may be asbestos in the drywall. I contacted my landlord to let her know what he told me and asked her to follow up once she received the quote. According to the tech, the quote was supposed to be sent to my landlord by 12/30. The landlord informed me that she would also contact the building manager to inquire about the asbestos. Today, the 2nd, I texted her to ask about the status of the repair. She told me that she hadn‚Äôt received the quote and hadn‚Äôt heard back about the asbestos complication. After pushing her, she called a different company. They will be arriving tomorrow, but I had to take off work to accommodate the appointment. 


At this point, I‚Äôm a little ticked off. The apartment is freezing, the asbestos issue is terrifying, and I can‚Äôt seem to get my landlord to move on anything or follow-up without my persistence.

We've got the answer for you!

The Make/Fix Anything Project is popping up at the Cheshire in Adam's Morgan on Monday! We'll provide the tools, know-how, and some craft materials (but can always use more!). You bring your imagination, humor, and any project you want to work on. The point is for you to learn how to do it yourself, not for us to do it for you.

We can help teach you how to FIX broken bikes, lamps, clothes, household materials, broken hearts, the world's problems....

We help teach you how to MAKE costumes, art, sculpture, hopes, and dreams.

Or we can all figure it out together as the spectacular creative weirdos we are.

We'll be in The Cheshire, 2412 18th St. NW (go up the alley from 18th and turn right) from 6-9 pm on Monday, January 6. We appear at the Cheshire (an innovative, multi-use art space) on the first Monday of the month and at the Arlington Library on the second Monday of the month.

For those of you who are unaware, a Doula is a non-medical birth assistant who provides physical, emotional, and informational support to a laboring person and their family. A Doula is NOT a replacement for a medical professional nor are they a replacement for a partner/mother/sister. A Doula‚Äôs assistance highlights everyone who is present at a birth while catering to the needs of a birthing person.

I‚Äôm certifying with DONA International, and to obtain that certification I need to assist 3 births and collect evaluations for those births (postpartum, of course). My package would include two prenatal meetings, support during the birth and for a few hours thereafter, and 2 postpartum visits. Because you would be doing a tremendous favor for me, I would not charge a full fee for my services, but instead ask that you cover my transit. 

I‚Äôm excited to continue my certification process. If you or someone you know is giving birth in the District of Columbia in December, January or February, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks for reading.

309,Barnst,1578484690,elrs35,Nan,"As usual, the DMV takes lots of crap for sending everyone home for a bit of slushy snow.   I‚Äôve seen folks point to fiasco a couple of years ago, but many may not know or remember that relatively minor snow storms have simply broken our region on multiple occasions.   So, for those for something to throw back at those snotty relatives, a brief timeline:

* January 2016:  With local officials focused on preparations for a weekend storm that would turn into [second highest recorded snowfall at Dulles](https://www.wusa9.com/mobile/article/weather/weather-blog/here-are-dcs-15-worst-winter-storms-of-all-time/65-598322161), no one was really paying attention to a small system rushing through the area on a Wednesday afternoon that Capital Weather Gang said would be a [‚Äúmini event‚Äù](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/20/pm-update-periodic-light-snow-a-risk-into-the-night-noaa-gathering-extra-data-ahead-of-the-storm/).  The storm burped out just a bit more snow and ice than expected onto untreated roads just as rush hour began, and the region [simply locked up for the next 9-10 hours.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/01/21/an-inch-of-snow-icy-roads-unleash-9-hours-of-traffic-chaos-across-d-c-region/)

* January 2015:  Despite days of forecasts calling for more than two inches of snow, northern Virginia school officials in the morning see clear roads and decide the event is a bust, so decide to keep the schools open.  They are [forced to apologize](https://wtop.com/weather/2015/01/schools-slammed-delayed-snow-cisions-recent-winter-weather/) for a decision that was called brainless, reckless, a miserable failure, and unacceptable.  As a result, it now seems to be official policy for Fairfax schools to close on reports of snow within 50 miles.

* January 2011:  With snow forecasted, the federal government closes two hours early.  Unfortunately, the snow also arrived two hours early.  And was heavier than expected, dropping three inches in an hour.  [Carmaggedon](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/carmageddon-1-year-later/1929019/) traps people on the roads overnight.

* February 2008:  With the presidential primary election ongoing, freezing rain sweeps through the region in the early afternoon.  In addition to the normal road closures and accidents, road crews somehow screw up the ice treatment plan for Mixing Bowl, prompting Virginia State Police to warn, ‚ÄúAvoid the Mixing Bowl at all costs.  It's completely iced over.‚Äù  The results are [predictably bad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/02/12/ST2008021202302.html?sid=ST2008021202302)

I‚Äôm pretty sure I missed some other instances that were less dramatic but still rough at the time.  

The theme that emerges is storms hitting in the mid-afternoon that aren‚Äôt expected to be that bad, but wind up putting down more than expected.  In some cases, just a *little* bit more at the exact wrong time was enough to turn the area into a parking lot and trap people late into the night.

It‚Äôs pretty easy to make fun of regional officials for getting it wrong and sending folks home to easily, and you can point to specific bad decisions that made each of those situations worse.  But from their perspective and experience, better to take some teasing and a lot of happy snow day memes than a region full of infuriated people trapped on icy roads until 10PM.",washingtondc,A brief history of DC-area snowy commuting fiascos

2) (am female) so are dress flats appropriate footwear or still too open?

3) The class is apparently a full day. Is that actually the case, and if so, what's the deal for lunch (pack a lunch, cafeteria on site, vendors, etc)?

I have a lot of experience in public policy, law, and social science research due to my Global Studies major and various internship experiences in the past. I am also an Economics major, so I'm qualified for business/consulting internships. 

I have a lot of the basics covered--some major think tanks with paid internships and a couple consulting firms. Does anyone have any other ideas (maybe somewhere you worked as an undergrad, or somewhere you work now)? I'm interested in public policy, governance, corporate social responsibility, consulting, lobbying, international affairs, etc. My research experiences specifically include rule of law, access to justice, ethnic conflict, and macroeconomics; I've also been really involved in domestic politics as a high schooler and undergrad.

My parents live in the Dominican where it is same price to have a cosmetologist come to your house for beauty treatments, ie gel manicures, lashes, etc. They are women (usually) who are trying to make extra money. The two services I have found here are crazy expensive to have this service. I‚Äôve looked on google, Facebook, Nextdoor. As a client who is a regular every two weeks, wouldn‚Äôt there be a nail tech or each service provider who would want extra money and come same time same place?! My step mom provides this as she‚Äôs a cosmetologist in the DR- yes you have to have your own equipment and be organized but it works. It saves time, is consistent and way easy and she gets way better tips. The prices in dc are double for this which is too much since I live in downtown dc. I have looked for the same thing for eyelash refills; in Seattle I went to a neighbors house who ran her business for select friends- and she would travel to houses no problem. Mobile tanning is big in other cities but not here- they have spray pop up tents that you put in a room to work with when they come to hotel or house. All of these are same price as salons- maybe just a few dollars more but not double. How can I find these at home services in dc?! Or find someone who wants a reliable, regular client?! I understand it probably is business registration licensing issue but also seems like in this city with high income, high maintenance young professionals like myself someone would be interested in providing or know how to find someone in need of extra clients!

But if you're wondering what is going on with crime in the city then take a look at this. Antoin Gaskins, case number 2019-CF2-15741. Multiple open cases to include where he pistol whipped his pregnant girlfriend. Gaskins plead guilty and is pending sentencing for Felon in Possession of a Firearm. DC Superior Court Judge Steven Berk released him to see his girlfriend give birth to his kid (the same one he pistol whipped) and told him to return to the courthouse by 2pm. He did not return to the courthouse. 

City police arrested Javon Gunter, case number 2020 CF1 000212, for Pre-Meditated First Degree Murder While Armed, who on video followed, chased and shot the victim wounding him and then walked up within 10 feet of him and shot him approximately seven more times with an AK pistol chambered in 7.62x39.

Thankfully I filed a police report the day the package went missing and I‚Äôm submitting a copy of it with my petition to contest the fine. In a neighborhood that is besieged by daily package and property theft, it feels especially injurious that DPW is issuing fines to the residents who are the victims of theft.

473,SaidenTzakol,1578873582,envw2o,Nan,"TLDR: I was a bashful and missed my chance to say hello to a handsome guy with a dog named Reagan.

So today I was getting lunch at Martin's Tavern in Georgetown with my friend--it was a nice day and, while I don't eat out a lot   cause this town is a bit expensive for a government employee, I wanted   to enjoy the great weather. They had this great patio in the shade and a   varied menu where my friend and I could both get something to eat. Pretty standard for a pub right?

Well   in the middle of our conversation about nothing in particular, I can't but help but notice that the handsome fellow at the other end of the   patio is smiling at me. Now you need to understand, I'm a pretty big   nerd so being a wallflower comes naturally to me and I'm unaccustomed to   attention. Trying my best to not spit out my coffee all over my white   cotton hoodie, I smile back. It then occurs to me *I'm not wearing my glasses* and he could be just looking down the street at which point I've now   made an donkey of myself. Shaking it off I go back to my conversation.

Still,   he's really handsome in a rugged way and over the course of the meal, I eventually build up the courage to pass his table, situated by the   entrance of the bar. Excusing myself to for the restroom, I venture pass   his table and... chicken out. He has a beautiful German Shepard and  two  friends. I'm not the greatest at approaching a solo guy, let alone  when  he's with his friends. Leftover trauma from accidentally  approaching  too many straight guys in Georgia. Going inside, I curse  myself and  waste three minutes washing my hands so it's not too obvious I was just  doing a drive-by viewing.

On  the  way out, I freeze in my tracks. He's just sitting there, looking  at me  and smiling. Nerd instincts kick in and I blush and rush past,  literally  stumbling over my own feet to find the fastest escape route.  During all  this, this extraordinarily handsome man just nonchalantly  leans forward  to pet his dog and asks, ""Who is this Reagan?"" But it's too late--I'm  already headed back to my seat. Was that an invitation to chat? Who are his two friends? What if one is his boyfriend?

During   the last ten minutes of my meal, I can't help but glance over numerous   times--but I'm too nervous to do anything except wink. My friend and I   eventually depart and spend about ten minutes across the street at Georgetown Optician, There, I stand outside praying like a high schooler that he'll come over briefly and say hello. Obviously I'm disappointed   when it doesn't happen because *this isn't a stupid coming of age story*. So eventually my friend and I leave down Wisconsin.

About   ten minutes later I finally tell my friend all that's transpired and helps me garner the courage to come back with my number written on scrap   piece of newspaper like its 1999. Only the gentleman and his friends have left; the busboy is clearing the table.",washingtondc,Lesson Learned: Seize the Day

&amp;#x200B;

These are 100% fact so not worth contemplating any types of related ""what-if"".

\-The loan is with Wells Fargo.  I have been through the process to request a modification.  I was denied.  The loan will not be modified under any scenario.

\-The figure to bring the loan current is not something I can come up with under any scenario.  With fees and expenses, all said and done that figure is 75-100k.

\-I have passed the time when Wells Fargo will consider a short sale.

\-The home has about 500k in equity in it.  I can't lose it.

\-The home was listed for sale one week ago.  No offers yet but my agent is expecting two low but not awful offers in the coming days.

\-I have a hearing set for Friday where they will likely set a sale date for the home.  If that date is set, I am almost guaranteed to get nothing.  I am in Florida and can't attend.

\-The house is currently rented with two tenants under lease in the two units that comprise the home.

\-If an emergency bankruptcy is my best option, I have no issue with that.

714,houseyak,1579510442,eraquw,Nan,"TLDR I was recently punched out of nowhere in the grocery store and nobody will show me the footage so I can see what happened

It was 11:45 on Saturday night.  I was walking home and stopped at Safeway to pick up some midnight snacks.  I was definitely buzzed but not sloppy or blackout.

I picked up my things and was waiting in line for self checkout.  Two guys were arguing about something while they checked out at different machines.  

One guy looked rather like me I guess‚Äîwhite, 6‚Äô1-ish, kinda skinny, bearded‚Äîand the other guy was around 6‚Äô3 or 6‚Äô4, rotund, black, clean-shaven, and was wearing a matching NFL hat and scarf.

I couldn‚Äôt hear what they were arguing about, who started it, etc. because I was listening to music.  The guy that looked like me checked out and walked away, still chirping about something over his shoulder.  

A moment later, the other guy (let‚Äôs call him Cowboy, although that wasn‚Äôt actually the team on his hat and scarf) checked out and walked away.  I was next in line and went to his machine.  I could hear Cowboy making remarks to the Safeway staff about ‚Äúwhite gentrifiers‚Äù as he walked.

I started scanning items but was soon met with an error message‚Äîhelp is on the way, return item to bagging area, etc.  Looking at the machine, I saw that there was an unpaid for item, a pack of Icehouse tallboys, left over from Cowboy‚Äôs order.  I guess he scanned them and took them but didn‚Äôt pay for them?  

The Safeway lady came over to check on the error.  She noticed the missing tallboys and sent the very small security guard after Cowboy.

I was just trying to pay and leave, but they actually brought Cowboy back to the machine and demanded that he pay.  He insisted that he did, but it didn‚Äôt sound like he had the tallboys on his receipt.  I was just standing off to the side, trying to give them space to resolve everything, still listening to music, not really looking at them.  I definitely didn‚Äôt intend for him to get tracked down over the tallboys, I thought she would have just voided them.  I wasn‚Äôt doing anything rude and I looked normal, although I did sort of look like the guy he‚Äôd been arguing with.

The Safeway lady said something like ‚Äúyeah, they‚Äôre not on the receipt, sir‚Äù when suddenly I felt a heavy blow to the side of my face.  Again, I wasn‚Äôt looking in that direction.  But it seems like Cowboy suddenly punched me and ran.

The punch didn‚Äôt knock me out, but it knocked me down, bloodied my nose, blackened my eye, and swole up the side of my face pretty good.  Cowboy was a big dude and it felt like he caught me pretty clean.  I lost a thrown softball in the sun last year and took it to the left side of the face and this felt a little harder but to the right side.

I got up quickly, didn‚Äôt lay on the ground or anything, but definitely feeling like ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù and a little disoriented and it seemed like Cowboy was now gone. 

The security guard was very apologetic, as was the Safeway lady.  They gave me a few [napkins](https://i.imgur.com/0jzft4R.jpg ) for the blood on my face.  I had to ask for more.  They resolved the error message.  I paid and left.  A young couple checking out next to me was shocked about the whole thing and asked me repeatedly if I was ok.  I felt ok, punched, but not too bad, and just wanted to eat my damn beef jerky.

I went home and ate and iced my face and watched Godzilla and went to bed.  I also bruised my hip and elbow a bit when I fell.

Sunday morning, I had a 10am softball game on the mall.  On the way back, I figured I‚Äôd stop by Safeway and see if I could get a look at the security footage.  The incident was in the self-checkout area and should be on film.  I still looked pretty gross but I had sunglasses and stuff.

I was rather surprised by the indifference at Safeway.  The very same lady who gave me extra napkins now shrugged and told me that the manager who could show me the footage was ‚Äúin the back‚Äù and (thus unreachable) but that he probably couldn‚Äôt show it to me anyways.  She recommended I come back 5 hours later after the shift change when the night manager might not be ‚Äúin the back.‚Äù  I‚Äôll note again that I‚Äôve been coming to this Safeway since 2012 and am familiar with the staff‚ÄîI joke with this lady about our shared taste in candy sometimes.

I went home and showered and decided to take another run at the manager.

I should mention that I have no interest, negative interest, in getting Cowboy at all arrested or bothered about this.  It‚Äôs no big deal, it‚Äôs not fair, turn the other cheek, etc.  I was just hoping to review the footage so I could get a clear idea of what exactly happened.  I‚Äôm also up for a promotion at work and my girlfriend was out of town so I wouldn‚Äôt mind knowing exactly how I ended up with a funny-looking face, and confirmation that I‚Äôm not secretly in a Fight Club.  I also feel like I actually took the punch pretty well and wanted to double-check that.  

And I‚Äôm curious as to what exactly happened, because I wasn‚Äôt looking.  What exactly spurred the punch?  Where did Cowboy generally go?  What did the security guard (who was standing right there) do about it?  Was I on the ground for longer than I remember?  What happened to the tallboys?

I managed to get the manager out of the back.  I explained what had happened and he was apologetic as well.  He said I couldn‚Äôt look at the footage without a subpoena.  He also wrote down the email of a corporate ‚Äúloss prevention officer‚Äù (Craig K) on the back of a money order log page and recommended I email him.

Neither option sounded attractive.  I‚Äôd be emailing Craig in the middle of a long weekend.  And what if he was in the back?  Or if he too demanded a subpoena?

I also doubted that a subpoena was strictly necessary.  I wondered what would happen if I came back with a police officer and asked to see the footage.  Again, not trying to get Cowboy in trouble.  I would stop short of filing reports etc. so I figured the cops would be reluctant and it probably wouldn‚Äôt work, but there was a station in the neighborhood so I walked over.

The two officers I dealt with were incredibly rude from the moment I was buzzed in.  I tried to explain my situation, although they didn‚Äôt really listen, and they repeatedly demanded to know why I didn‚Äôt file a report as soon as it happened.  At this point it was only about 12 hours after the incident.  They insisted that they would need to assign a detective, open a case, press charges, arrest Cowboy, I would need to go to court, testify, be cross-examined, etc. and if we did all that then I could see the footage.  I explained that wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for, and tried to make my exit.  

They harangued me as I left, repeating the steps and scoffing at me for not reporting the incident when it had happened at midnight the night before.  At this point I was showered, wearing a button down shirt and jeans, and wasn‚Äôt talking or looking crazy besides the swollen face and black eye etc.  At one point they asked me if I was a police officer myself, which I thought was a pretty odd question given the circumstances, but they were probably just mocking me.  

There was also some other dude in the room, not a cop, just a guy (but his dad was a cop, apparently) and he was freely offering his thoughts on the situation the entire time.

So here we are on the evening after this whole thing, about 28 hours after being punched, and this is I suppose where it will end.  I still have less interest than ever in bringing the criminal justice system into Cowboy‚Äôs life.  I hope I have a clear enough recollection to answer awkward questions.  The swelling will hopefully be mostly ok by Tuesday, although the black eye and the cuts may still be there.  

Overall I just felt like this was a crazy interaction with the modern world, and it definitely gives me renewed empathy with those who have to deal with more serious issues through these systems.  The interaction with the police was particularly black eye-opening.  I can only imagine how difficult that would be if I was reporting a sexual assault or really anything that mattered, or if I was more distressed or confused by the situation, or couldn‚Äôt speak the language well, etc.  It was truly unhelpful and stupid.  I know that‚Äôs not always the case, but over the course of my life that‚Äôs definitely been the general trend for me and my friends when it comes to personal interactions with police, if not much worse.

If anybody has any reasonable ideas regarding obtaining the footage or some other way to gather information about the encounter, I‚Äôm all ears.  I‚Äôm also open to ridiculous heists.",washingtondc,Got punched at Safeway any tips?

First, I messaged the mods to clear this first, because I know how annoying it is to see 3929889 mens haircut posts on here.  

**For any future redditors searching for 'mens haircut' go to B&amp;C Hairstyle on 16th street, they do an incredible job and it's like $22**.  They take venmo now, which puts them ahead of Diego who I think is overrated for a cheap cut anyway.

So for my actual question:  I've had the same longer haircut for like 7 years, but my hair is starting to thin.  I am terrified I am going to wind up with a trumplike combover thing if I don't reassess what I have going on here.  The cheap spots, and even a lot of the expensive barber shops are more order takers than anything in my experience... and I'm not sure how to tell them what I want, as I don't really know what will look best for my hair.

What I'm looking for is a place that can give me a simple, easy to maintain hairstyle  that works with my hair, advise on what products I should be using, and will tell me how to have one of the B&amp;C type spots get close to what they are doing.  I just kind of need a consultative hair reboot, am bad at doing it myself and have no problem paying to get a better idea from an expert.

I've seen both David Rios and Neven @ Ian McCabe recommended.  Anyone else you guys would point to as a good place to accomplish this mission?  I will be a total mark and buy the products they want to sell etc.  Assume price isn't an issue, although I'd prefer to spend less than $100 if possible unless it's going to be magical.

I lost my DC drivers license on Dec 18 at Dulles airport. Over the last few weeks I‚Äôve been holding onto hope that the airport, TSA, or airline lost and found would find it - but alas it looks like I will need a new license.

To order a new ID online you must know your drivers license number. I cannot seem to find mine on any documents that I have around the apartment and really do not want to go to the DMV with stacks of paperwork.

I‚Äôm sure that somewhere along the way, someone has taken a copy of my license while living here. Any suggestion / ideas would be greatly appreciated. So far I‚Äôve checked my new hire paperwork from my job and all copies of documents from automotive stores.",washingtondc,Drivers License Woes

The Senate will (very likely) be in session for the impeachment trial on Saturday, and Bernie will be there. We should meet up outside the Senate and rally to support Bernie and to make it so the media cannot ignore his support, given all the impeachment coverage, and to support a fair and just impeachment trial. Honestly I want to get a huge, energetic crowd there, but even if just a couple people want to join I think we should go for it. Hell, I'll go alone.

I've never organized anything like this and if enough people are interested I'd gladly work with or pass this off to someone with more experience (or if no one does then to get a sweet team together to make this happen!)

**I will be outside the Senate 2 hours before the start of impeachment proceedings Saturday!**

I don't have a Facebook, so if someone else makes an event there I will link it in this post!

Once that's done we could share that via Twitter and use the #ILikeBernie to get it started trending and use #IAmNobody as the event hashtag... but perhaps some of you have a better idea!

Are there groups we should reach out to? Are there any major DMV area Bernie groups that could blast some emails, help us organize, and bring more supporters?

This morning (Wednesday) I badged in and it charged my cash balance, but then this afternoon it showed a balance of $162, which was reduced when I badged out.

I did not expect to see a number balance after the unlimited took effect since I understand it is a use it or lose it.  But if they were going to show a balance, I would have expected it to be the $162 for unlimited plus the prior balance. Hopefully my prior balance is hiding in the background for longer than usual trips or when my month is up.

833,dazedbeancounter,1579812912,esz9xz,[Quality!],"Hello Capital of America,

Would you believe I'm having trouble finding my people in this incredibly talented and knowledgeable bubble?  I know y'all are out there, however few you are. I'm looking for those who see past the physical sparkle of earthly possessions. Who recognize true richness is found in the connections we make with others. 

Me: Forever a cynic and distrustful of societal structures.  I feel most at peace in nature, I dream of escaping society to sit under the trees with the breeze in my hair.  Can talk about space and the stars for hours, whats out there? Are they real or just breathing holes for our cage? The jam band scene, filed with weed and bass is where I am most comfortable but I'm looking to drastically expand my comfort zone. Lets get the basic DC questions out of the way. I moved here for a job, I've been here a little over a year now and my home state is Colorado.  

Adventures I'd like to have in 2020: Mushroom hunting, especially magical ones. Camping somewhere other than Shenandoah. Never have I ever been kayaking. Volunteer somewhere I'm passionate about. Explore these gorgeous museums I was so excited about during my move yet have somehow avoided them this past year. Some type of play, symphony, orchestra, ballet... the Shen Yun show is catching my interest. Looking to put a stamp in my newly acquired passport. Full moon gathering at COSM. Something you are passionate about and would like to share with me. 

I am only looking for friendship, its not a hard line but I would prefer people closer in age to 30 or above, open minded with an exploration streak is a plus. 

Reply back with your adventure list and maybe we can find one to explore together. Or where you find your peace? Why are we here? What is the purpose of life? My favorite topic... your existential crisis and how you found your way out, or maybe you haven't yet and would like my 2 cents. I look forward to discovering my new friends; come and find me in all this noise :)",washingtondc,Are you my friend?

960,dcmods,1580131040,eunrf0,Nan,"As the subreddit approaches 100,000 subscribers, we would like to open a discussion on the current rules, clarify how they are implemented, and receive feedback from the community.

**Current Rules** 

Full descriptions can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/about/rules/)

*No memes/image macros*: Memes are only allowed during government shutdowns, OPM closures, and during the period between a championship win and the parade. The exception to the parade rule is when the parade is months after the win as we‚Äôre seeing with the Mystics. We will always make an announcement when the meme ban is lifted. A meme/image macro is a low effort or image-based post that‚Äôs meant to be funny or make fun of something. For example [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/afdr0o/a_pic_i_snapped_earlier_of_the_costco_parking_lot/?st=k53ztis1&amp;sh=03df558a) is a meme post whereas [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/csfe6m/intersections_of_washington_dc/?st=k53zur11&amp;sh=26c49117) is a regular image post that‚Äôs always allowed.

*No Solicitations*: This rule covers buying, selling, job-related, surveys, and other solicitation-related posts. Buying/selling goes on r/DCDump, however, we will allow the post if you are giving away something FOR FREE, especially if time is a factor (for example: giving away tickets for a concert that you cannot attend at the last minute). Events should be kept to the weekly events thread that is stickied Weds - Sun. Job-related posts should be directed to r/dcjobs and housing directed to r/dcforrent. Automod does remove some of these posts. The mod team receives a notification when a post is auto-removed in modmail and we generally do check and approve fairly quickly if the post does not break the rules. In addition, do not post any referral codes. 

*Relevant to the region*: While this subreddit is DC focused, we do welcome our users from the surrounding area and have always allowed posts about happenings near DC in MoCo, PG, Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax, and other nearby regions. We‚Äôre an area of sharing and that is reflected in our subreddit‚Äôs size relative to the subs for nearby regions, with this subreddit acting as an anchor for the DMV. What is not allowed are posts that are not relevant to the local community, this is r/washingtondc not r/politics. Timeliness is also a component, posts of old articles will be removed.

*No reposts*: Reposts are not allowed. Please keep updates on breaking news to the most active thread posted within the past 24 hours. In instances where many posts are submitted at once, the mods will attempt to preserve the post that is seeing the most activity and is from the most credible source, not necessarily the submission that came first. If it's a breaking story, please check /new/ before submitting. We will try to include a link to the first post in our removal reason.

*Keep it civil*: No slurs no racism, no anti-LGBTQ, no bigoted, no ableist language, and no concern trolling around this issue. Comments like ‚ÄúI bet I can guess the race‚Äù is absolutely a dogwhistle and is subject to mod action. There is little patience for trolling, slap fights, or pile-ons. Certain topics also tend to attract drama and uncivil behavior and will be closely monitored. Thread locking and bans will occur if there is any brigading. We‚Äôd also like to point out that our subreddit is a lot of tourists‚Äô first impression of our city so consider what you represent here.  

*No illegal activity*: Posts encouraging, promoting, or otherwise supporting illegal activity will not be tolerated. This includes inquiries into where/how to purchase fake IDs, promotion of illicit drug use, underage drinking, fraud, etc.

We understand the marijuana laws in DC are a complicated situation. We have to ultimately comply with [Reddit‚Äôs sitewide policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/reddits-policy-against-transactions), and so no posts regarding purchase, sale, gifting, or otherwise transacting in marijuana are allowed. We do not want to get banned or draw the ire of the admins, r/DCents already got banned over this policy (plus, no one wants a sub over-run with weed solicitations). Posts that discuss news or policy issues related to DC which otherwise concern marijuana or other illegal activities may be allowed, but are heavily moderated and will be locked without notice if they become vehicles for helping users buy/sell marijuana or otherwise engage in illegal activities. Wiki posts outlining the law are welcome, so long as they do not implicitly or explicitly give recommendations for buying/selling/otherwise acquiring marijuana. 

*Time restricted photos/videos*:  Tourist area photos are allowed to be posted Friday - Sunday and on holidays.. Please keep in mind that photos posted on Sunday may persist on the front page into Monday and Tuesday; we will not remove them if they were posted during the safe harbor. We allow photo posts during the week as well that do not depict traditionally touristy parts of the city. Creepshots of random people and homeless people are not allowed. Vlogs are also never allowed.

*Rule 0*: Please do not try to cleverly circumvent the rules listed here. These rules exist as general guidelines, by and for the community, and are flexible. The mods have discretion to remove posts/comments if they are viewed as toxic to the culture of the subreddit or otherwise disruptive.

We are open to suggestions to update any of the rules listed, though we are most interested in discussing your thoughts on rules 6 and 7 as they seem to cause the most strife among users. If there are any rules that you think need additional clarification or items added to fall underneath them, please let us know and we can discuss.

**Update on Questions Policy**

Low effort posts, especially regarding commonly asked questions, will be removed and directed to be posted to the monthly small questions thread. This includes frequent questions that can be easily found on Google, such as those about barbers, gyms, where to live, can I afford to live here, etc. (unless it has some new and unusual factor). Before making a new post, please consult the [subreddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/wiki/dcfaq), use the reddit internal search, or Google, or consider posting in the monthly small questions thread. If you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù recommendations please define what ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù means to you and be as specific as possible of your needs. DC is an expensive city, affordable here can feel super expensive to someone from a lower cost of living area.

**Local Media Accounts**

We love that our local media interacts with us. WTOP, WAMU, Fox 5, Washington Post, and others have been great contributors to our subreddit and have spurred a lot of quality discussion. However, if you are using us to write an article or gather information please disclose it. If you are affiliated with local media in an official capacity and will be posting as such, please let the mods know so we can give you a special user flair.

**The Subreddit Wiki**

Did you know that we have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/wiki/index)? Anyone can edit it! We need your help to update and organize it so that we can have a more central source of useful information for tourists and residents. Specifically check out our new [Metro](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/wiki/metro) page and help us build out our [restaurant recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/wiki/food). Please let us know page ideas to add to the index so that you can fill them in easier.

Do not troll/vandalize the wiki pages. Doing so will result in a permanent ban. When making edits, please list some reason for your revision.

**Subreddit Icon**

[We currently do not have a subreddit icon](https://puu.sh/F2yQr/5ef3924020.jpg), if anyone has an idea or original design for one, let us know! 

**Call for New Mods**

As we approach 100,000 users, we would also like to put out a call for new moderators. The day to day work is fairly low with the occasional busy periods, and we ask that you be able to join the mod team in our Discord. If you're interested, please post below. Include some info about yourself if you'd like. If you think someone else would be good, please either tag them or if, they've posted, upvote their comment/reply to let us know you support them.

**Coming Soon**

Be on the lookout for a demographics survey and state of the subreddit posts in the coming weeks/months!",washingtondc,2020 Rules Discussion and Mod Search

Pros: 

*  It's super conveniently located, smack dab in the middle of everything. 
* The neighboorhood CID is great. I've been consistently impressed with how they communicate information and keep residents informed. I also love how they solicit feedback from residents and act on it. 
* The liquor store literally has everything you need and is well organized
* Safe and clean 

Cons: 

* We need more public gathering spots. They have a LOT of spaces in the works, but it'll be a year or more till they're ready. 
* The Safeway is a terrible grocery store, terrible selection and so expensive 
* It looks very corporate at times, a lot of the buildings are the same looking 
* The farmer's market is small 
* I want more food truck/quick grab options, or maybe window side pick-up type options. Where I can get like a taco or a cup of coffee without having to go into a restaurant. 
* Need better Asian food options 


Overall I'd recommend it, it's so close to everything else it's not that inconvenient.

991,ShadowDancer11,1580221036,ev6502,Nan,"By decent I mean equaling any deli in NYC that serves up coffee in a greek paper coffee cup for $1.50 and half-and-half that is real cream, not half skim and half water. That's my minimum baseline standard. 

My contract transferred to a location near the Capitol Building. In that time, I swear, I cannot find a damn decent cup of coffee anywhere around here. I'm floored by the number of eateries in the area labeling themselves as ""gourmet this and that"" or ""serving you since 19 blahditty blah"" but cannot get coffee right?!

Every shop I have tried between Union &amp; the Constitution, the coffee is any of the following: 

* Watered down and weak
* Near flavorless (cheap beans)
* Tastes like charred coffee (over roasted beans - probably bought for cheap)
* Tastes like it was brewed through a sock
* The water is soft and leaves a bit of a off aftertaste. 
* All of the above! 

Thus far I have been to to the Illy shop in 101 Constitution next to Charlie Palmer, West Wing Cafe,  Sandwiches by Phillip, Capitol Cafe, Firehook, Cosi, etc. etc. 

I tried Blue Bottle at Union Station but $4.50 for a piddly 8oz cup of coffee every morning? Take a hike. Oh and they don't accept cash! Good luck with that policy, guys. I'm sure there's a civil rights discrimination lawsuit on the horizon for you. 

I've even tried Chic-Fil-A, McDonalds, and Dunkin in the station. \*Starbucks is overpriced junk. Yes, I was slumming but I was desperate! Au Bon Pain's coffee barely made it but it lacks body. 

Pitango Gelato and Compass, are both pretty good but a bit too far away after I get off the train and again, on the pricey side for a daily morning cup.",washingtondc,Need A Recommendation For A Place That Makes a Decent Cup of Coffee Anywhere Between Union Station &amp; Capitol Building

Hi All,

I have been a **biomedical engineer at a start up company in Rockville, MD for two years now.** I have done everything from biomedical to electrical and computer engineering while here. I went to Boston University and got my BS in Biomedical Engineering, a minor in Electrical Engineering, and a concentration/research in nanotechnology. I then went to Northeastern to get my MS in Bioengineering where I focused on Medical Devices and performed research in nanomedicine.

At my current job, I am focusing on **MRI technology:** all of the nuts and bolts since we are building them from scratch. I love the experience I have gained and how hands-on this job is; I truly feel like an engineer.

However, **I don't know if the engineering life (nor start up life) is for me**. I want to find a job that is more structured, utilizes my organizational and communication skills, and allows me to use my technical background to advance companies/science/research/etc.

Having been taught to look for jobs SOLELY in medical device/pharma companies, I find myself wondering what else is out there in Washington, DC.

SO MY QUESTION IS: **Does anyone out there know of a good fit for someone with an engineering mind that wants to delve into something else like law/policy/government/consulting/etc in the DC area?** I would really like to stick within the city of DC or Arlington. Thanks so much!!!",washingtondc,Biomedical Engineer Looking for a Career Switch in DC

Yes, I know, I know, it's February and you might be losing a little of the new year's excitement steam under the cold and gray skies. But that's more reason than ever to get out of the house and do something with your hands!

The Make/Fix Anything Project is popping up at the Cheshire in Adam's Morgan on Monday, Feb 3. We'll provide the tools, know-how, and some craft materials (but can always use more!). You bring your imagination, humor, and any project you want to work on. The point is for you to learn how to do it yourself, not for us to do it for you. 

If you have a complex project, feel free to contact us ahead of time so we can tell you what materials to bring and make sure that we have the right tools for you. You can message Jenn over Reddit or Matt at  [https://www.facebook.com/makefixanything/](https://www.facebook.com/makefixanything/).  

We can help teach you how to FIX broken bikes, lamps, clothes, household materials, broken hearts, the world's problems....

We help teach you how to MAKE costumes, art, sculpture, hopes, and dreams.

Or we can all figure it out together as the spectacular creative weirdos we are.

We'll be in The Cheshire, 2412 18th St. NW (go up the alley from 18th and turn right) from 6-9 pm on Monday, February 3. We appear at the Cheshire (an innovative, multi-use art space) on the first Monday of the month and at the Arlington Library on the second Monday of the month.

This person advertised the price as inclusive of all utilities, as well. The price itself isn't ""too good to be true"", though, and does come across as a bit high (~$1450).

I was able to visit the room in person, and asked questions. It turns out that this person would create a lease between us (or whoever decides to take that room), instead of me going through the building management company and adding myself as an official occupant, and it'd be for 1 year, and utilities would be covered, unless there was ""abuse"" of utilities, in which then we'd pay the overage. 

A few questions I have:

a) Is this common, especially in corporate-owned buildings? I thought those companies tended to ban subletting. (FWIW, my current building, owned by Bozzuto as well, bans subletting, but I know it depends on the building.)

b) As I understand it, I'd be paying the roommate directly each month for this set amount, there'd be a lease between us; AND another lease between them and the apartment building. Are there any risks in this arrangement? 

c) Anything sketchy-seeming about this arrangement? They seemed nice enough, and not sketchy at first glance, but I wanted to check and see if I was missing anything.

1074,lostboythrowaway69,1580396199,ew6m2f,Nan,"Hey guys.

So I'm going through a point in my life where I need to make a huge  decision. I need to pick one place to work/live for the long term.

I'm a single 28 year old asian male with a crap ton of student loans to payoff. Currently finishing up a residency program in medicine and interviewing at 2 locations for jobs. Keep in mind, both practices want me to stay long term...like at least 8-10 years or even til retirement. I love going out and ""dating around"" but I feel like I need to start taking relationships more seriously and consider settling down soon.

Here's the downlow:----------------------------------

(1) First Location: Dallas, Tx

* PROS:
   * Great job prospect - possible equity/buy in
   * No state income tax
   * Lower cost of living
   * One of my best friends lives there
   * People seem friendlier?
* CONS
   * Far away from family
   * Less diverse
   * Not sure if I would want to stay here for the rest of my life

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Second Location: Washington DC (job is in DC but may live in northern virginia (cheaper Cost of living) or DC)

* PROS:
   * Great job prospect - possible equity and complete buy out
   * More diverse/More asians (I don't know ...sometimes I feel more comfortable with more asians around even though my closest friends are white/black)
   * Have a couple of friends here but not as good as the one in Dallas
   * Seems like a more dateable scene? possibly more chance of finding someone to settle down with
   * Closer to family (parents live in southern Maryland)
* CONS:
   * Much more cost of living than dallas
   * Income tax is 8.5%
   * Seems like it is more hustle and bustle/ ruder people
   * Not sure if I would want to stay here for the rest of my life - but could see myself here since it's much closer to my parents (southern maryland)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm honestly losing sleep from this even though its somewhat of a good problem. What do yall DC natives think?

I live near East Falls Church so I ride my to the metro and then metro to Reston and either head back east or bike west to the breweries out towards Sterling/Ashburn.

Basically, I have a friend coming to visit in a few months and he wants to do that with me. So we considered doing the bike share for him,. The problem is the furthest out bike share is in Reston and you only get 30 minutes per ride and even if you do a day pass you have to ‚Äúdock and undock‚Äù it every 30 mins or you get charged. The bike share program makes sense if you were inside the beltway or DC proper but outside the beltway it‚Äôs harder to do it.

I‚Äôm wondering if he should just bite the bullet and buy a day pass and then buy a cheap bike lock to have when we were at the breweries and get charged extra for the more time.

Our flight to Dulles is scheduled to land at 4:25pm on Saturday, April 4. Our flight to Tokyo departs at 12:30pm the next day. Neither of us have been to Washington before and we are keen to see/do as much as we can in the short time we will have.

Tentatively, the plan is to book a cheap hotel near the airport, quickly drop our bags off after we land, and then get downtown. I‚Äôm guesstimating that we won‚Äôt get downtown until about 6-6:30. Was thinking to go straight to the White House, walk to the Capitol Building, and stroll through the National Mall to see the Washington Monument, Lincoln, MLK, FDR and Jefferson Memorials. We‚Äôd love to actually go into some museums or go on a proper tour through some historic buildings but figure we don‚Äôt have much time, so probably best to just walk around and see what we can see. 

I know there are other memorials and such in the National Mall ‚Äì are there any I didn‚Äôt mention that we should make sure we don‚Äôt miss?

Other sights or suggestions for things we should try to fit into our brief visit?

Areas or specific places to go for dinner and drinks? Also, any food trucks or anything that might be around the Mall at that time on a Saturday night if we wanted a snack to hold us over until we got to a restaurant?

How should we get around ‚Äì uber, taxi, public transit?

Should we stay in a hotel near the airport or downtown? If we stay downtown, we could maybe do a bit more sightseeing in the morning, but then we would have a longer journey to get to the airport, so maybe not much point since we should get to the airport by 10:30am and I‚Äôve read that traffic getting there can be pretty bad. But maybe not so bad on a Sunday morning?

Yes, I know, I know, it's February and you might be losing a little of the new year's excitement steam under the cold and gray skies. But that's more reason than ever to get out of the house and do something with your hands!

The Make/Fix Anything Project is popping up at the Cheshire in Adam's Morgan on Monday, Feb 3. We'll provide the tools, know-how, and some craft materials (but can always use more!). You bring your imagination, humor, and any project you want to work on. The point is for you to learn how to do it yourself, not for us to do it for you.

If you have a complex project, feel free to contact us ahead of time so we can tell you what materials to bring and make sure that we have the right tools for you. You can message Jenn over Reddit or Matt at [https://www.facebook.com/makefixanything/](https://www.facebook.com/makefixanything/).

We can help teach you how to FIX broken bikes, lamps, clothes, household materials, broken hearts, the world's problems....

We help teach you how to MAKE costumes, art, sculpture, hopes, and dreams.

Or we can all figure it out together as the spectacular creative weirdos we are.

We'll be in The Cheshire, 2412 18th St. NW (go up the alley from 18th and turn right) from 6-9 pm on Monday, February 3. We appear at the Cheshire (an innovative, multi-use art space) on the first Monday of the month and at the Arlington Library on the second Monday of the month.

Like the person will literally be standing within 15 feet of a trashcan and they'll just toss their bottle or trash on the ground. It's so shameless that it almost feels like they're trying to make some kind of statement out of the act.

It really makes my blood boil every time I see it happen, but I never know what to do when I see it. Calling the police seems like it'd be overkill, and besides the person would be long gone by the time they got there. I've thought about saying something to the litterer, but my guess is that these people are incapable of shame and that I would put myself at risk by causing a confrontation with a complete stranger. Today, I was actually contemplating starting a Tumblr or Twitter account called DC Litterers and then snapping a picture of people to publicly shame them, but some of the litterers are probably minors and it might cause some blowback.

My boyfriend accidentally left his phone on the metro while we were in DC. We realized almost instantly and rushed back. Talked to the station manager and checked the trains later on. We tracked the phone getting off the train at Greenbelt (the last stop on the yellow line) and then it sat there for an hour before we believe it was turned off. We don‚Äôt think someone stole it because who would sit at the last stop for an hour THEN turn it off. I am hoping it got turned it and the station person left it on simply to receive texts/calls and then turned it off. We filed a report with lost and found on Thursday night when it was lost and have not heard anything. The bad scenario is whoever was working at the station stole it and never turned it in.

This happened Monday night around 10:00 PM across from the Giant grocery store in Columbia Heights. 

I just got back into town from out West. I was hungry and tired, so I stopped by &amp;pizza to get food-to-go. Got food, and began walking home with food in hand and small carry on luggage. Across the street, I see a group of 6-8 teens, some of them on bikes, hanging around the parking garage entrance. I noticed one of them carrying a pole or stick around 4 feet long. Didn't think much of it. 

I continue walking with my headphones on. One of them gets behind me and hits my backpack with the pole thing. Not too hard, but it gets me to turn around. At this point, I am confused, and said something like ""what the hell are you doing?""

He starts laughing sort of in a joking way. At this point, I don't feel threatened, just confused and cautious. I then turn around and notice another kid with a pole. I'm not sure what to think. I couldn't quite tell what the poles were made out of. I take my eye of the second kid for a second, and he swings and connects with the right side of my head. 

At this point, I am shocked and still confused as to what the hell is happening. Luckily, the pole was made of really light plastic. Although, it still hurt a bit. I think he took another swing and it hit my right hand. At this point, adrenaline kicks in, and I lunged towards the kid who hit me. He starts to take off across the street and drops the pole in the process. I pick it up, and the other kid starts backing off. I start to take inventory and decide to get the hell out of there, with the pole in hand. I didn't want to give chase since I had a backpack and luggage. Couldn't leave those unattended. 

This whole thing occurred in about 30 seconds, I'm guessing. Shockingly, there didn't seem to be anyone out there. I walk around that area all the time, day and night, and never imagined something like this happening. 

I am fine, just some minor swelling/redness on my ear and bruise on my hand. 

Please be safe and vigilant out there, guys and gals.

Does anyone know some good surf fishing spots to check out?  I.e. not too far a drive from DC, public parking, good structure/features for fishing.  I prefer working a shoreline to fishing a pier.   I have all the standard  gear and have a good enough grasp of the fundamentals that I should be able to pick up the nitty gritty of tackle, bait, and methods from watching and chatting with other anglers, I'm just not sure where to get my initial foothold.   If you can also recommend a good shop nearby that would be happy to advise and outfit an out-of-towner, that would also be very helpful.

I'd be looking to target saltwater sport fish.  Rock fish (stripers to me) are an obvious place to start with the spring migration approaching, but I'm always down to wrestle a blue fish and am also interested in going after some species we don't have up North - drums, cobia, sheepshead.  I'll fill the cooler when there's some (non-threatened) tastee bois around, but 90% of my fishing is catch-and-release.  

Thanks!",washingtondc,Surf Fishing Spots on the Chesapeake

My wife just got a new job in Lanham, and I'm starting in Mclean in the next couple of weeks. We picked this neighorhood since she has a short drive to get to work and I can just take the silver line. We are late 20's with no kids and I grew up in Bethesda so I know the DMV fairly well. Although I've never really had a reason to spend much time in this side of DC. 

We are currently choosing between a 1 bdr for 1600 and a 3 bdr house for 2700 that the landlord said we could airbnb the extra rooms in. 

Is this a good neighorhood to live in? Or would it be better to try to live closer to the center of the city?

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct place to post this but I figured why not, I‚Äôm getting desperate. I‚Äôll make this long story short (ha). I moved to DC almost three years ago in May. A job or the like didn‚Äôt bring me here, I moved here out of my own volition with my own reasons, goals, etc. People tend to be taken aback when I mention that. Ever since my relocation from Oklahoma (yup) I have had some good fortune during my time here. Both of my living situations have been truly unique and from what I have gathered, quite rare in some aspects. I‚Äôve had a handful of jobs as well. And that is where this post gets to the point: I have been jobless since September after a contract non-renewal and barely scraping by. I will admit and with unease (simply because I know this is not the case for everyone) that I do have a financially ‚Äústable‚Äù backing. Therefore, my rent and some of my expenses are ‚Äútaken care of‚Äù. I can actually hear all the eyes rolling at this point, please stay with me. I live a humble life here and would say that I am thriving, as Oklahoma doesn‚Äôt really offer much to those outside the heteronormative lifestyle. In fact, most of my good fortunes in DC (living situations, jobs) have been simply because I am gay. As of this summer, if things do not pick up in terms of job searches/opportunities (no luck now) I am debating moving back home simply because of expenses. While I am not completely torn up about that idea because of x amount of reasons, at the end of the day I think I wouldn‚Äôt take it very well. Being a transient city, a 2-5ish year tenure sounds about right in a place like this, yes. I would rather not find excuses to ease this option but simply find something to keep me here. I have a few gigs for extra cash (nothing consistent). My experience is all over the place - and no, I don‚Äôt have a masters degree. I know what I am up against in this market. All that being said, has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how did you mend it rather than something like luck? I could go on but I‚Äôll stop there for now.",washingtondc,Thriving in DC

Some choice quotes:

""Metro must fix inadequate, inconsistent or outdated track safety and maintenance policies that lead to some track workers essentially winging it and others skipping key maintenance or inspection procedures, the first-ever audit from the independent Washington Metrorail Safety Commission found.""

""Among the issues, Metro has failed to do proper rail safety checks on dozens of hot days; there are conflicting or missing directions about safety-related speed restrictions and quality control; and there is no evidence proper lubrication refills are happening on curves, which would mean more wear and tear, more noise, more energy use and an increased derailment risk.

There is also no evidence most supervisors are doing required quality checks of repairs each month. Seventeen of 20 mainline track inspection quality control spreadsheets were either completely blank or fell short of the minimum four checks per month.

Metro cannot even say for sure whether it creates work orders to repair problems identified by track inspectors or a high-tech track inspection vehicle, and had no evidence of work orders for some other key maintenance work.""

""Supervisors do not get specific training on their jobs after a promotion, workers are using outdated inspection forms in rail yards, some equipment operators are sent to make track repairs or use certain equipment without proper training, and Metro does not have written training requirements for track and structures positions anyway, despite those being required by Metro‚Äôs own System Safety Program Plan.""",washingtondc,"[WMATA] Significant track safety and inspections problems, per WTOP"

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Mayor Bloomberg has faced more heat lately for some of his past stances on issues such as stop-and-frisk and the claim that the end of redlining was responsible for the financial crisis. Do those stances concern you?


Mayor Bowser:

&gt;I am grateful that Mike has explained those positions, especially as it relates to stop-and-frisk. He did it again to people last night in Houston, recognizing it was a policy that had unintended consequences, and that he wished he had put a stop to it sooner. I think that is the mark of a good leader: recognizing when they have made a mistake, and doing everything they can to correct it. But what‚Äôs also important, and I know what African-American voters across our country are interested to hear, is what is your plan for black America. How are you going to create more black homeownership and close the income gap between blacks and whites? What are you going to do to create jobs and help small businesses grow?

I've seen a few resources online listing murals and their locations, but all the good ones seem out of date. Please list all your favorites, what murals you consider the most iconic, and what areas of town have high concentrations of murals. 

Thanks!",washingtondc,Murals of DC: Where are your favorites? Which are the most iconic? Where area of the city has the most murals?

My take is this, I walk with confidence, head up and make eye contact with the driver. If they slow down safely for me to pass, I give them a thank you wave and job/fast walk across the road. They let me go so I want to let them get on with their day. The assholes that almost run me over then slam on brakes, I tend to give a ‚Äúdude it‚Äôs a crosswalk sign, slow down‚Äù look.

I can't drive yet but I have a well paying job in a shitty neighborhood (NE, Langdon, industrial). I'm going to admit I'm pretty racist here in that all the men who have cat called me are black.

fake beard, a cap, and a pair of large loose denim pants.

Additionally if I am perceived as a very small man I may not be able to fend off the more violent attacks an actual man may face in such a dangerous area, ie teen bike gangs, juvenile delinquents, others who want to pick a fight. Therefore I'm afraid to cross dress but would feel more comfortable being out of  a man's radar as a sexual object.

Head to Phillip's on 1st St, b'twn D &amp; E St. NW.  Ask for the *French Toast Breakfast Combo*.

Most places in DC, you can't even get a bag of chips and a soda for $5.80, let alone a complete breakfast. 

Now, the caveat is that it's arranged as a sandwich. That's not a deal breaker. The syrup and butter are not on the sandwich. They are put in a separate containers. When I arrive at work, I deconstruct the sandwich - which amounts to taking the french toast off the top and bottom - and put it all on a paper plate, but most times I eat it as is.

I, sigh, met a man through OkCupid about 6 months ago who responded quite poorly when I told him I was not interested. We had gone on 2 brief dates, and something just didn‚Äôt feel right to me. He responded with a barrage of angry texts that quickly morphed into angry phone calls and later emails. The last email he sent me (this is insane) was asking me to stop contacting him. He wrote that I was harassing him and making false allegations. I wasn‚Äôt, but I think he wrote it so that if I did report him the police would question my actions.

For the past few months I have been receiving very threatening texts from random google voice numbers. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs him, but I have no reason to believe it would be anyone else. I never had such a negative experience ending any sort of relationship.

This evening I got another text from him. I wasn‚Äôt sure who it was, so I asked. He wrote me back stating that I was a psycho, weird, an asshole, etc. etc. Normally I would just brush off his behavior as annoying, and another example of why online dating is the worst. However, because he knows where I live, and seems to be a bit vindictive in his actions, I would like to file a report just in case. Might I add, he is a government attorney with access to many databases.

1995,MoldySixth,1582444376,f86jy9,Nan,"From: [https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/6qcyhd/catcalling\_in\_dc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/6qcyhd/catcalling_in_dc/)

As  well as my previously locked post where I was upfront and professed my  prejudices, I'm going to be clear about one thing. MOST women do not  feel safe on the metro. I'm a woman, I get harassed and catcalled on a  weekly basis. I'm 5'3, 100 lbs, I don't stand a fucking chance with most  men who come after me. The consensus is: Keep your headphones out. It's  dangerous to not be aware. Head-swivel. And the other consensus is:  Keep your headphones in. You can tune out the creeps that way. And you  know what? I already waste 3 goddamn hours of my life on the Metro and  as much as I chose to do this, I have a RIGHT to feel safe and I have a  RIGHT to listen to music or podcasts and not have to worry about being  harassed, subjected to demeaning behavior, or threatened.

For  this paragraph, men need not interact. Women, you know what I'm talking  about. Relentless staring, intrusion of personal space (men sitting  next to you when there are plenty of other seats), intimidation tactics,  men saying ""How are you,"", and when you don't respond they say,  ""Entitled bitch,"" or ""Bitch"", ""Are you married?"" in my case, ""You only  date Chinese people? CHINGCHANGCHONG,"" ""Come fuck me"", ""I would lick  your ass"", ""I would (verb) that (private bodypart)"", lewd suggestions,  rude gestures, being jacked off to yadda yadda yadda-- these instances  are \*just\* the tame ones. Women who have been ejaculated on (if no one  believes me on this one, I can try to find the link and edit this post  with the link), groped, generally not being left the fuck alone when  trying to get from point A to point B.

\*\*\*Let's  cut to the chase. There's strength in numbers. We're all likely to be  making the same commute. This thread is to match girls up with other  girls as train-riding partners. You can either post here with your  starting stops and ending stops and the time you expect to be there or a  meetup place. If mods allow it, I'll start by posting my starting point  and ending point along with the times.\*\*\* This doesn't even have to be a  friendship. Just try to have someone to be with you so you're less  likely to be singled out and violenced.

I  don't want to be responsible for anything going wrong, so coordinate  amongst yourselves and be smart-- don't just agree to meet up with  someone somewhere. Ask for verification or physical description, video  call the person so you know they're legit, meet in a public place with  your metro-buddy, chat and establish expectations. That said, violence  doesn't always see gender. Be careful with who you choose and always be  on guard.

Also,  women, I encourage you to tell your story. If you have been harassed or  made uncomfortable on public transport or even just being in public for  fuck's sake, write your story in the comments. The one I linked above  had men saying ""damn, I didn't even know women were subjected to that  behavior"", we need to raise awareness. I bought mace (Maryland,  represent!), I dress like a man (I still look feminine but I hide my  hair), and it still happens. It still happens. IT STILL HAPPENS.  It  happens every day and I know all of you just have to stand there and  take it, just like I do. It doesn't have to happen anymore.

We  don't have to accept this as an inevitability. We can be smart. We can  be proactive. And I want to leave with a closing statement. If something  is making you feel uncomfortable, forget about being polite or looking  socially acceptable. Make. A fucking. Scene. Yell. If someone is groping  you or cornering you, yell about it so bystanders know. Keep your  camera on so you can take pictures of offenders and SHARE this with MPD  (seems like they don't do anything, but here's a link you can report to:  ( [wmata.com/harassment](https://wmata.com/harassment)).

\*\*\*Also,  to men who also may feel unsafe on the metro, given that there seem to  have been ""rowdy"" groups of ""teens"", random stabbings, shootings, and  other violent happenings on the metro, I suggest you do the same in the  comments and try to find a riding partner. For either gender, what the  MPD does for any of us is LAUGHABLE. LAUGHABLE. Do a search in the  comments of any of the below links.

Sources  used for this post. They are anecdotal, yes. But this isn't about  statistics. It's about hearing what you're saying, having the same exact  experience as you, or being afraid of having one as an inevitability.  I've heard you through the years, I know why you write these posts and  why there are these news stories on here. It's not because you're  sheltered, you're a baby, or that you're making a fuss out of nothing.  DO NOT feel shamed into silenced. You aren't being fussy, you aren't  being a wuss. Most crimes are criminal on criminal. Most of us will not  be a victim to random violence. BUT. Being a random victim to random  violence could be the end of your life.

Hello all,

We are GMU students developing a new dating app called SpecUdate for people 18+ in the DMV area including Washington DC!

The SpecUdate mobile Application will initially serve to help singles in the DMV to connect online! The main difference between SpecUdate and other dating apps will be that on SpecUdate, users will create their own personal ""Get to know me"" games for other users on the App to play (Two Truths and a Lie &amp; Truth or Lie). When two users connect, the result of this game will be used as an icebreaker tool before chatting. The beta version will release May 2020. We have almost 1,000 email sign ups in the DMV area. If you are interested in the app, please sign up with your name and email at [Specudate.com](https://specudate.com/) to be notified upon beta release! Every sign up counts! Thanks of listening, you can learn more about SpecUdate at [Specudate.com](https://specudate.com/) or check us out on social media (@Specudate Instagram/Facebook/Twitter). Inquiries can be sent to [info@specudate.com](mailto:info@specudate.com).

Best,

Some background info on me: late 20s guy from the Midwest with a background in healthcare analytics (on the insurance side and also for a large third party vendor) the past 6 years or so. My real passion is to ultimately get involved in some form of policy work whether with a think tank, NGO, or the government. I visited DC about a year ago to check out the big International Relations grad programs offered by the schools in the city (Georgetown, American, JHU, George Mason). I fell in love with the city, however I have a hard time pulling the trigger on potentially 100k of grad school debt that these programs might put me in. 

I've been thinking about trying to get a job within the healthcare space (whether insurance companies, health systems, provider groups, third-party vendors) in DC, and once I'm there trying to pursue something more along the lines of my long-term career interests. Honestly, I've lived my whole life in the area that I'm in now, and I just feel like I'm at a now-or-never moment in my life where I need to go somewhere and do something different. Based on my long term career interests and the cultural/social amenities on hand, I think DC is a good fit for me.

As everyone on this sub knows, DC is expensive, so ideally I would want to have a job lined up before making the move. The problem is I know it's not easy finding a job somewhere when you're currently out-of-state. So I'm wondering for all the out-of-towners on this sub who moved to DC from elsewhere, how long did it take you to find a job, and in what industry?

That means...your bike is probably stuck in a garage somewhere and kind of rusting out, if you can remember where you put it at all...? But you really wanted to bike more this year...? (OK, maybe I should stop making this about my own bike habits.) 

Anyway, if your'e excited about Spring and the upcoming bike season, but know you'll need a tuneup and want to learn how to do it yourself, we have the event for you!

Join us at the Make/Fix Anything Project this Monday, March 2 from 6-9pm at the Cheshire, a multi-use art and event space in Adam's Morgan. We will help you teach you to make or fix ANYTHING--for FREE! This month we're partnering with [The Bike House](https://www.thebikehouse.org/) for an especially bike-centric event. We provide the tools and know-how and you fix it yourself!

Don't worry, though...if biking isn't your thing, we'll still help you with clothing and small appliance repairs, ridding the ocean of plastics, and mending your broken heart. (Practically) nothing is off-limits! If you do have a niche project that you want to work on, however, we ask that you let us know ahead of time so we can be prepared with the right tools and advise you on the proper parts to bring.   

[The Make/Fix Anything Project](https://www.facebook.com/makefixanything/) is a nonprofit movable makerspace that pops up in [The Cheshire](https://www.thecheshiredc.org/) every first Monday of the month from 6-9 pm, and at the Arlington Central Library every second Monday of the month fro 4-7 pm. 

Click here to learn more about the event and mark it on your FB calendar:  [https://www.facebook.com/events/243571873334606/](https://www.facebook.com/events/243571873334606/) 

To get to the Cheshire, go through the alley at 2412 18th St. NW and turn right at the back of the building. The doors will be immediately on your right. Feel free to post questions or propose projects!

2186,Ibtc26,1582838477,faj6jn,Nan,"A resolution to my insanely high water bill in December (link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/ecj1ec/1600\_november\_water\_bill\_help/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/ecj1ec/1600_november_water_bill_help/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) ) yes, it has taken this long. The water bill total actually increased from $1600 to $2049.50 since the high consumption was split between two bills periods. They tried to tell me on the phone it was a leaking toilet and they also told me since we had an electronic meter there was nothing to check - the readings were valid. I contested both bills and submitted a plumber report to them on 1/8. 

On 1/10 DC Water after ""investigating"" for 2 days found our charges valid, saying that we needed to pay the $2049.50 or petition within the next 15 days from the date of the findings letter. Of course, that letter dated 1/10 was not mailed out to us until 1/15 (thanks DCWater) and wasn't received until Friday night, 1/17. Which effectively cut our time to write and mail back our petition to them in half. But we petitioned and the next Monday I called the water division of the DC People's Counsel for legal help. I highly recommend giving their office a call if you have a high bill like ours and need help dealing with DC Water. 

Flash forward to Feb. 14th and we get a date for our hearing with DC Water - March 11th. Our 2 bills are on hold until the hearing. The People's Counsel is also requesting documents and info from DC Water on our behalf as well during this time. I know having them communicate with DC Water gave our petition some teeth. And with a date for the hearing, the People's Counsel schedules a Skype call to go over documents with us and schedules one of their legal reps to attend the hearing as well.

But yesterday when I went into my account to check daily usage and pay our bill that isn't on hold, I noticed that February usage was crazy. On Feb. 5th our usage showed us using NEGATIVE 318 CCF of water (approx. -238,000 gallons). The opposite of our current problem. If you use negative water does DC Water pay you?

https://preview.redd.it/jj9kv9jl9jj41.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8117898219dad91ef2436d5557a9503ebe35f71e

In any case, this morning DC Water called me and said that apparently our meter is broken, they'll be adjusting our charges, and the hearing is cancelled. This afternoon they issued the adjustment of minus $1789. Which is AMAZING, but I'm also wondering if they saw that crazy day in February and decided we were right? Or maybe that was their meter check? In any case, working to get an adjustment dragged out insanely long and correspondence with DC Water was a nightmare. I know this post is long, but if anyone else runs into this issue I hope this can help you or provide a light at the end of the tunnel.

TL;DR: DC Water charged us $2,049 in water bills for 2 months. We contested, petitioned, and won an adjustment after 3 months of bureaucratic bullshit.",washingtondc,$2000 Water Bill - UPDATE

It started a few weeks after I moved in (I figure he was on vacation at first), and since then there has been constant cello and bass playing coming from next door. At one point he had a group over for practice, after which I left a note on his door asking him to please consider finding a private space for band practice (I figured this was a nicer route than the upstairs neighbor who took to pounding on the floor). After that he came over to talk to me which is how I learned he's a professional musician who gives lessons out of his apartment and also practices there in his free time. He was very apologetic and said he didn't realize the sound traveled between apartments (though I'm incredulous) and that he would no longer have band practice at his apartment, but obviously the lessons have continued since that's how he makes his money.

I recognize that he's paying money to live there and he can do what he wants inside his own apartment. But I did not sign on to living next to a music studio and had I known this was the case I probably would not have moved here. There's no quiet hours in my lease I can point to. He doesn't play very late in the evening, but it's how often it is that's irritating. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

I've attended the IZ orientation and registered myself with the program, so right now I'm entering lotteries. I'm a teacher and my income puts me two pay raises away from the tippy top of the 80% MFI range. I did the math, and after accounting for fixed expenses, groceries, and gas, I'd be left with about $300 at the end of each month (there is some variation, but I crunched the numbers assuming the lowest paycheck I ever get - base pay without any additional stipends added to it).

An open letter to the woman who called me an asshole on the metro Friday night

Hi,

I'm not exactly sure what you think happened on the Metro around 7:00pm Friday at DuPont.  I thought that I'd let you know my perspective.  

When I got on the train I decided to stand rather than sit.  I don't mind standing and I was only going a few stops.  I thought that I'd leave the few remaining seats for those who might need or want to sit.  A couple of other passengers were also standing.

Before the train got to DuPont Circle it occurred to me that I should move away from the doors as I was not getting off at that stop.  I found a new place to stand where I wouldn't inconvenience anyone getting on or off the train.  I didn't bump into anyone and no one bumped into me.  You walked to the (still closed) doors (the train was still moving) and said ""Asshole"".  You didn't say it to my face, but you didn't say it under your breath either.  It was clear that I was supposed to hear it.

Our conversation went something like this:

Me (confused and not at all confrontational):  Was that meant for me?

You (very angry): Was that so difficult - to move away from the doors?

Me (still very confused and somewhat hesitant): No...it was really easy...that's why I did it.

You:  Heaven forbid a guy act like a gentleman in this city!  Instead you have to be a dick!  Just what this city full of dicks needs!  Another dick!

You exited the train at DuPont Circle.

In the future I'd hope you give your fellow city-dwellers a little more leeway when they act to correct some thoughtless or absent-minded action they have taken - especially when they correct themselves before it causes any inconvenience to you or anyone else.

From your tone I got the impression that you thought you were doing your part to make the city a more courteous place.  I would suggest that you were doing the opposite.

Sincerely,

A-Hole on the Metro",washingtondc,A-hole on the Metro

I'm seeking advice on moving, such as where to look, if I need a car, if full time jobs are competitive (and the average pay), etc. I'd also appreciate if you could enlighten me about how much money I would need per month to live decently (metro pass, rent, home internet, all that).

I have some savings, about $4000, and would most likely be paying for everything myself, unless I can find a roommate!

2387,jobbunsure,1583272177,fd26ap,Nan,"Hi all,

I need some advice on how to deal with my building management. In november there was a fire in my apartment building and extensive water damage due to the sprinklers. They had to replace the dry wall in my apartment and repaint, etc. Since then we haven't had kitchen cabinets and they've been giving us rent concessions but stopped doing so in February.

This week they told us that the cabinets would be installed, but when they came in to do the work they tore off all the cabinets in the kitchen and took away the sink and counter without any notice. So what was to be a small job has resulted in us being unable to use the kitchen and it's a tiny apartment with an open layout, so we have dry wall bits all over our apartment. It's really frustrating because this wasn't communicated with us. Is there anything I can do besides move out when my lease is up?

Thanks for your help!",washingtondc,Issue with building management

I've lived in the Bay Area pretty my whole life so I think moving somewhere new would be exciting and a change of pace. My job will pay $120- 150k depending on bonus so I would have some flexibility on housing.

My main reservations are: I'd be leaving all my friends and family. My cousin does live there which is nice but he travels 50% of the year. Additionally, being a true Californian, anything below 50 degrees is frigid so the weather will take a lot of getting used to. 

The reasons I'm leaning for it are: I would still be living in a big city so I'm sure I can find new things that interest me, make friends, and get a feel for the culture. I think the job would be really really interesting and there's a ton of upside in trading so I could make a really significant income over the next 3 years if I take it. Lastly, I feel like the Bay Area has become so techy and has really changed the Bay Area culture.

2521,the_ranch_gal,1583515181,fegphi,[PSA],"Hey friends!! So theres a lot of misinformation out there, but yesterday I went to the hospital with a SUPER high fever (delusional), chest pain, shortness of breath, weak, totally out of it, sore throat, minor coughing. I had the flu and the cold this year, so I was worried I had the coronavirus and wanted to be tested quarantined. I have never had any respiratory problems in my life and am a healthy 27 year old woman except i always seem to get sick. 

Anyways,  I want to Holy Cross and I tested negative for influenza, strep, and my chest x ray came back normal, so they diagnosed me with some type of ""virus,"". The doctor said it could be coronavirus, but that they wouldnt test me because they only tested children and those with further complications, of which I had none. 

So I got discharged and am now quarantining myself in my home. 

But!! When I get better, I'd love to help out those who think they have it but nobody to take care of them. I can get you meds, be a comfort buddy (I have 2 adorable puppies), make sure you are hydrating, eating soup/tea, drive you to urgent care/the hospital, etc. I just moved to DC so I know how it is to try to fight a sickness alone, and I felt so lonely and hopeless and the whole time I wished I had someone to care and watch Netflix with. 

I know this seems weird but I'm just a caring young woman in general and totally want to show off my dogs :p. Just kidding, I care about you! 

Anyways, message me for your number and I'll see what I can do for you all. I'm feeling much better but the doctor said I should wait until the 8th to resume my life. So just keep me in mind!!

I found some studios available at the Woodner for $1200 utilities included, and for the location (I like the Mt. Pleasant/Columbia Heights area) and price it almost seems too good to be true. 

I've looked it up and seen some rather alarming reviews online (along with positive reviews), but I always try to take those with a grain of salt. A lot of the reviews about ""safety"" seem to maybe be more...racially tinged rather than based on fact? Complaints about ""strange characters"" and ""section 8 residents""...so I'm leaning towards discounting those, although safety is important to me. And then some reviews mentioning bed bugs...I don't expect any place I move into within a city to be completely pest free, I just expect that it be dealt with swiftly, but I do have a bit of PTSD around bed bugs as I had them last summer and it was exhausting. 

Curious to see if anyone has lived here or known anyone who has and has overall enjoyed it. Again, I don't expect to have a perfect experience living anywhere that is going to fit within my lower budget, I just don't want it to be a nightmare.

GW has reached out to these students to provide additional resources and support. We are also providing space for those students who live on campus to self-quarantine. We are working closely with the DC Department of Health, monitoring the situation and preparing for potential impacts to our campus and the surrounding community.

There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on the GW campus or of GW students at this time. However, we are taking precautions. Students who may have been exposed to the coronavirus that are symptomatic, including having a cough, fever, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing are encouraged to reach out to the Colonial Health Center at 202-994-5300, or their healthcare provider right away.

Please continue to visit the university‚Äôs COVID-19 website, go.gwu.edu/covid19 and stay updated on the latest campus messages and guidance.

We're looking at a 120-130 person wedding in central DC. No one seems to do buffet or family style, or they claim it's more expensive than plated service, which is odd to me... maybe family style or buffet are more common on the West Coast (where I'm currently based)??

Is an $18k quote for 130 people normal?! We were hoping to keep catering to $13k or less. Is that a pipe dream? The venue allows us to BYO booze, so this is just for food, staffing, basic rentals (the venue provides chairs and tables, so this is just glassware, silverware, linens, etc.). My friends in CA and MA are paying $10k or less for catering services!

I'm trying to research how to negotiate with a caterer, but wanted to get an idea of whether this is a normal catering range in the area! Any tips for how to negotiate with DC caterers? Is it helpful to bring in other proposals to show them what other caterers are quoting? Everyone seems to price things differently (and not every caterer will provide a line item breakdown), so it's hard to compare.

However, until recently I never used the buses because they were new and unfamiliar and seemed complicated. I would just walk the 1.25 miles to the metro station, partly just because I really enjoy walking where I live but also just because I was avoiding the bus. But recently I broke my foot so I can‚Äôt walk anymore and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm paying $30/day to uber to work. Turns out they‚Äôre really not that hard, especially when you know your most useful routes, and they cover practically every square inch of this city and a crap ton of the greater DMV, they‚Äôre quicker and come more often than you think, and they only cost like $2. That‚Äôs like 1/8 of an uber ride. And you don‚Äôt have to tip a bus driver, although I actually think they should be allowed a tip jar. Although I guess it could cause some route altering preferential treatment hanky panky for big tippers. But anyways, it‚Äôs a really efficient way to get around town and DC has a top shelf bus system. Like I had to take the bus in Colorado Springs for 6 months after a little glug glug vroom vroom incident (I was a reckless, selfish child in college). Trust me, you really appreciate DC‚Äôs bus system after using one in a city of like 200,000 people out west. There it‚Äôs just a half hearted attempt to check a box and not a serious attempt to make a system people can rely on to get around town in a reasonable amount of time. I can actually use DC‚Äôs buses for time sensitive stuff like doctor‚Äôs appointments and go basically anywhere. The bus I took in the springs came once every 75 minutes and was somehow still +\- 15 min off the scheduled time. And the route took like 35 minutes too because the city is so damn spread out. And there were no screens telling you how many min to the next one",washingtondc,Don‚Äôt be afraid to take the bus. It‚Äôs not as complicated as it seems and this city has truly excellent bus service by American standards.

As of now, I‚Äôm not wholesale cancelling the meetups for a set number of weeks.  That said, I‚Äôve decided to not hold it this week due to 1) an abundance of caution wrt the current public health situation and 2) by coincidence, I‚Äôll be out of town this week.  It looks like it‚Äôs in everybody‚Äôs best interest to avoid large gatherings, and cramped DC bars are not really the environment for that.

I‚Äôm thinking the happy hour status will be on a week-to-week basis.  I‚Äôll make a weekly go/no go post every Thursday like normal.  In the meantime, everybody stay safe and healthy out there.  Avoid touching your face, don‚Äôt hoard medical supplies, avoid large groups and travel, yada yada yada, refer to the subreddit Coronavirus megathread for more information.  

If you‚Äôre new to the city and you‚Äôre looking to make new friends, I hate to say that it‚Äôs kind of difficult time to do so; just sit tight and wait for us to resume.

When I brought this up at the dealership, they aggressively told me that everyone pays taxes and that I would get a refund come tax season. Well now as I file my taxes, I haven't found anything at the state level for DC that will allow me to claim this/get a refund back.

On March 11, 2020, in order to provide additional coordination for the District‚Äôs response to the coronavirus (COVID-19), Mayor Muriel Bowser declared both a state of emergency and a public health emergency. During this unprecedented public health emergency, DC Public Schools (DCPS) remains committed to ensuring the well-being of our students and school communities. Therefore, starting Monday, March 16 through Tuesday, March 31, DCPS will modify operations to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in our region.

In our ongoing efforts to address community health risks and ensure the continuity of learning for our students, DCPS will follow an updated schedule between March 16 and March 31:
Monday, March 16 ‚Äî Teachers and staff will report to school to plan for distance learning. No school for students.

Tuesday, March 17 to Monday, March 23 ‚Äî DCPS will take its Spring Break for students and teachers. There will no longer be a Spring Break period in April.

Tuesday, March 24 to Tuesday, March 31 ‚Äî Students will participate in distance learning. 

Wednesday, April 1 ‚Äî Schools will resume operations.
During this period, there will also be no school-sponsored activities such as athletics, extracurriculars, field trips, events, or afterschool programs.

We are grateful for the patience, flexibility, and cooperation our DCPS community is demonstrating as we manage the dynamic nature of this event. As we approach the next few weeks, we ask for continued patience and trust as the District navigates this unique situation. 

While this decision was made to prioritize the health and safety of our entire school community, we understand it will be disruptive to our families. With that in mind, I want to share some additional details about what distance learning will look like for our DCPS students and the supports we have in place for families over the next few weeks . . .",washingtondc,DCPS brings up Spring Break to next week; distance learning for the week after

2913,LittleSpiderGirl,1584116924,fi2cfk,Nan,"Yes, everything is subject to change lately. 

I posted a question last week about commuting into the District for a job interview on 3/12 and the good people of this sub helped me out.  Unrelated to Covid-19, the interview was postponed until 3/17. 

I'm aware the interview could be postponed again due to the virus.  However should it still be on, I'm now wondering about taking the Metro.  FWIW, at age 62 I'm a member of the target population.  

What are older workers doing?  Still using the Metro?  Are the trains less crowded right now because of telework?  

I could Uber in for the interview.  But if I get this job, I'd be a Metro rider everyday anyway.  I guess I'm just confusedly conducting a risk assessment.  

Thanks for any thoughts you can throw my way.",washingtondc,So is Metro ridership down? Asking for an older friend......

I really wanted to advise this person to live within his mean, get a place that is a little below the average so that he can continue to keep it afterward and won't have troubles finding another place to live, but I looked it up and the program requires that he pays 60% of his income and the government would pay the rest. So there is no incentive to live within his mean at all.

Also, 60% of his income? Don't taxes take another 25-35%? What does he have left afterward? What's the incentive for working? Shouldn't he use this period to train himself to have a better skill to earn more money afterward instead of working? How does this program really work? Does it really help people?

### Sick Leave for Exposure to Communicable Disease

An employee is entitled to use sick leave if health authorities or a health care provider determine that the employee's presence on the job would jeopardize the health of others because of exposure to a communicable disease. An employee is also entitled to use sick leave to care for a family member who has been similarly exposed. The use of sick leave would be appropriate in these circumstances even if the employee or family member is not sick but would be limited to circumstances where exposure alone would jeopardize the health of others and would only arise in cases of serious communicable diseases, such as communicable diseases where Federal isolation and quarantine are authorized, which currently includes: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and influenza that causes or has the potential to cause a pandemic. See [CDC's Legal Authorities for Isolation and Quarantine (external link)](https://www.opm.gov/leaving/index.aspx?link=http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/AboutLawsRegulationsQuarantineIsolation.html). This provides an illustrative, but not exhaustive, list of the types of serious communicable diseases where exposure alone would jeopardize the health of others.

Thousands of kids travelling multiple times then spending time together in close proximity while a highly infectious virus circulates, seems like a great way to control the spread of the virus. 

I‚Äôm certain that a good amount of those students will return to the homes of their parents in the meantime, some probably have their grandparents there too. Some of those kids should say goodbye to Grandma and Grandpa once they get home just to be safe, maybe their parents too if they‚Äôre of a certain age or have diabetes/a preexisting health condition.

On top of all that, a good amount of students who are unable to make it have been told what amounts to ‚Äútough shit, find someone else to grab your stuff for you‚Äù and been denied emergency housing. This includes several immunocompromised students that are considered HIGH RISK for the virus and students that literally cannot make it home and ones with high risk family members at home. A close friend of mine who lives with her father and grandmother who are both considered very high risk due to preexisting health conditions and age was essentially told ‚Äútoo bad, come get your shit‚Äù. 

The school is handling this in one of the worst ways possible that is guaranteed to cause infections rates to shoot up and some people, elderly and at risk family members of the students, will end up dying due to their negligence.

I (27M) grew up in the Tenleytown/North Cleveland Park area and after a series of serious life events in the last 6 months, I have been forced to move back in with my older parents after 7 years of living on my own. I am generally unashamed of this fact, but moving back here 2 weeks ago has made things especially difficult.

Between a horrible break-up down in NC, my parents being somewhat hostile toward each other (even before we have been forced to spend 100% of our time at home together), losing my job to outsourcing/automation 6 weeks ago, and my non-professional life revolving around music, live concerts, and trying my best to have a social life; Coronavirus has really messed with my mental state and my ability to re-assimilate into District life (finding a job, friends, etc.)

I'm sure some other people have been feeling even more isolated during this time and I am genuinely curious how you may be coping with the loneliness or feelings of isolation. Usually, I would just go down to the 930 Club, U St Music Hall, or any of the fantastic music venues and make friends with common interests but the social distancing and whatnot have made the opportunity to make new friends or even finding a job nearly impossible.

I don't know what i am expecting to get out of this post, but I don't really use social media during times like this and I'm not really in the headspace to start swiping on tinder.

TLDR: Just moved back to town, don't know anyone, don't have a job, trying to find things to do that may be slightly less lonely than sitting in isolation with 2 people in their 60s for the foreseeable future.",washingtondc,Just moved back to the District after 7 years in North Carolina...

I have two full-time jobs in DC, one has been furloughed. The other may be eventually, but it looks like we keep marching on this week, at least (I am a federal contractor at this job, private sector for other). Can I apply for unemployment for one job while still working the other full time? If the other furloughs, can I apply for UI both in DC? If not, can I cancel this one and move forward with other job, since that one pays FAR more?

There is also a question about which job is most recent that I can't really answer since BOTH are most recent. I figured it was really asking which job I am applying for, so I chose that one as an answer, but don't want to, through system limitations, commit UI fraud.

I've been following the Coronavirus news since December, and I am well aware of the danger that lies ahead, which I have mentioned. Owners and colleagues replies with, ""how would closing one or two weeks even help?""

It will help flatten the curve. Duh. 

Financially, I'm sound and not worry of long term closure. Health wise, I'm a healthy, non smoking/drinking 34yr male. Work wise, I am following the strictest sanitization rules after each and every client. Commuting wise, I walk 1 mile to work so I avoid as many people as possible.

So I am trying my hardest to be safe and healthy. Also staying as far away from my parents just incase I am asymptomatic.

Yes, I could leave or call out of work for two weeks, but that isn't always easier said then done. However I would like to be out of the salon as a team instead as an individual. Especially since I only do haircuts, and can't leave my colorist stranded.  

Do you know if DC Mayor will mandate a salon closure? Yes, I understand alot of people in the industry will be hurt, but it's already happened to restaurants. But it may save countless lives down the line in the long run.

As you know, we've cancelled our weekly r/washingtondc happy hours for the foreseeable future.  Bars and restaurants closed this week, which gives us a solid metric to track when we might return... but we'll play it by ear, it might even go longer than that.  See the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/fhiino/a_statement_from_ustannisfan24/) for more details.  In the meantime, enjoy the lovely spring weather from your basement window, and if you venture out for the (tourist-free!) cherry blossoms, make sure you bring a long stick to bat people away.


On a more serious note, I'd like to use my soapbox to advocate for our community during this difficult time.  People in the service industry, small businesses such as the bars we frequent, even friends and neighbors may not be able to keep on making their living while working from home.  If you have the means, consider supporting your favorite local business/watering hole/musician in this difficult time.  To keep this on-topic, I know that a lot of the bars we frequent with this group are offering meals to go (including booze!) or selling gift cards.  Check my post history to see some of our favorite spots.  Consider a donation to a local food bank too.  It's up to those with the means to support our community; if you're not in a position to do so, that is absolutely ok too.


**No happy hour this week.**  Keep checking here every Thursday for more updates and snark.

3359,LizLemonDonaghy,1584655007,flipm4,Nan,"Hi there r/washingtondc \- I know that many of you have been furloughed at some point in the past. I am getting furloughed at my job, albeit in the private sector so I recognize there may be differences. I know that while furloughed, I can apply for and receive unemployment. However, I have two questions about this: 

1. I know typically for unemployment, you have to demonstrate that you're looking for work. Since I'm furloughed, I won't be. Is this waived for furloughed individuals/ 
2. I also know that if you make any income, it is typically deducted from your unemployment check? Is this the same if you're furloughed? My company is paying is 20% to cover benefits so will the unemployment agency deduct that amount from my unemployment check (essentially wiping it out since 20% of my monthly salary is most of the max unemployment benefit)? If this is the case, do they deduct net or gross? Finally, do you know if they deduct payment made from using PTO? 

Obviously I will ask the unemployment agency too, but wanted to see if anyone knew in the meantime as I work on my budget. Thanks for any help!",washingtondc,Questions about unemployment for those that have been furloughed

I'm scheduled to be working in DC. I've been there several times but this time I'm actually staying there. Looking for pointers I can't find online.

It appears the whole White House area is premium demand zone for street parking. I believe this means it's a 2 hour limit between 7am-10pm, correct? I believe this also means you can't just park and refill with coins or ParkMobile throughout the day... and you have to move to a different zone?

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone who is savvy with the healthcare system could shoot a little advice my way. I just got my permanent residence card and dallied too long with getting the health insurance, until I started to cough a little a couple of days ago. The insurance will not kick in until April, so I am left with a decision to go to the hospital and struggle with the astronomic bills later, or wait until either the health insurance activates or the symptoms resolve or worsen.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am after is an advice about how to manage the hospital visit in a way that will cost the least while providing the necessary treatment - do make an appointment with a general practitioner or go into the emergency room directly? Do I ask the staff to make do with as few diagnostic procedures as possible? Are there any programs that have just been put in place for this situation? Are hospital bills negotiable at all? Every little bit will help!

We‚Äôre classified as ‚Äúessential‚Äù so we‚Äôre open even in the midst of the pandemic we‚Äôre in. Now the shop I recently acquired has a manger who is a mtf transsexual. When I asked the previous owner about the manager he said that she was a good worker and by all accounts liked by the other employees at that particular shop. However because the manager‚Äôs lifestyle goes against my morals and ethics I do not want to be associated with that manager personally or professionally. Furthermore as an open transsexual I have a feeling she may drive away customers who are uncomfortable with her identity. 

Now recently, I posted on r/legaladvice about jurisdiction on lgbt protection rights. My company is headquartered in Virginia and about 75% of my shops are in Virginia.(with the rest being in Maryland) Unfortunately Maryland has very strong LGBT employment rights and Virginia has just passed LGBT employ emend rights that go into effect this summer. However both the posters on r/legaladvice and a friend of mine who is a business attorney said that I probably won‚Äôt face legal backlash if I fire her on the basis of her sexual identity before June, when the law goes into effect. However, even if I don‚Äôt face legal consequences I‚Äôm still worried about the potential backlash in the community and social media. 

So I was wondering how LGBT friendly is the DC metro area. I‚Äôve been living here a while and I know the area very liberal, but I‚Äôm not sure how LGBT ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù it is. If word gets out I probably wouldn‚Äôt face backlash from the community in general right? Also is there a large transsexual groups here in DC?

Caveat I've not used it yet, but I was the one that posted a few weeks ago about helping others so wanted to share this. I saw it circulating on FB. From the creator:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So  I worked the last two weekends with my son to create a website that  matches homebound people with task/errand requests to volunteers in  their area. Think grocery runs, etc. It works anywhere in the world  where we can identify your location. It's called [Next Door Helper](https://www.facebook.com/nextdoorhelper/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA-n7v3VYNESoSfKothw9mSsrER5m9vYBdaTOxW7Yj8HpPsXsUJR-Loiwr7KtAQMHX_pg22NGMjyHuXabpQDaNBZMUwIHepSrdC94-_CrJqLLuxKx4qCEyjaB8Sv9VqhscCBFW3jzfn4Z0CUcWH44EraUbXLSa_gBtxdN1S3Rz4rVM7K815kG93Nu7qYhDKYMY01tTuRl0CT0SojkvGXlYxPfV8zAjY6RyXYG_oHYBBjS8&amp;__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARCz5lpbisCjCJPfM4ojBeI-bVfKb64BajcMoSI1aC7HFZd6d5chbnVHd0JZApwJXsSBUxWMJ59F-58sIQYFxVwILvmPjtf3W3V_TBLpPgoA0GeMi4jjl5bKJi5oCDv47Jclsr3ocqV5sK_JgM6fsCzR4gNnNEnAot6flE7chIkdVCH6LBk5JUDoVXuJnJoIfHhrVX0O_kRcRbfc7iGRVNjv3BdmjZiDosFcxfgjCCBN82E&amp;__tn__=K%2AF&amp;eid=ARC5ad-AzeaAt47qzaYvjtWt5Ip1lbb9pxrNUCLBSmDYyYrQEgADpirWgGJ07AL2lqBQZF-GzdefXY3h) and you can find it at [https://nextdoorhelper.org/](https://nextdoorhelper.org/?fbclid=IwAR1DhCiguBXix_B8mzYXypKjoBZsbaXvmenArU787Tic3-T9QgawHW8oWQc)   
   
&gt;  
&gt;Here's how it works:  
   
&gt;  
&gt;1. You register either as someone who needs help or someone who can help.   
   
&gt;  
&gt; 2. If you need help, you post a request. Volunteers will both see this  on their homepage and receive an email for requests in their area.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; 3. If a volunteer offers to help someone, the person in need gets an  email where they can accept the offer, decline the offer, or withdraw  the request.   
   
&gt;  
&gt;4. If they accept, an email is sent to both parties to work out the details. Each person rates the experience afterwards.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; For safety's sake, there should be NO CONTACT and NO MONEY EXCHANGED.  You need help? Just ask. You want to help? Just help and walk away.   
   
&gt;  
&gt; Hopefully the seriousness of the times we are in will minimize abuse.  But of course if people don't feel comfortable using it, don't.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;This is just our small contribution in the wake of the [\#coronavirus](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/coronavirus?epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCz5lpbisCjCJPfM4ojBeI-bVfKb64BajcMoSI1aC7HFZd6d5chbnVHd0JZApwJXsSBUxWMJ59F-58sIQYFxVwILvmPjtf3W3V_TBLpPgoA0GeMi4jjl5bKJi5oCDv47Jclsr3ocqV5sK_JgM6fsCzR4gNnNEnAot6flE7chIkdVCH6LBk5JUDoVXuJnJoIfHhrVX0O_kRcRbfc7iGRVNjv3BdmjZiDosFcxfgjCCBN82E&amp;__tn__=%2ANK%2AF)  to help us get through these troubled times.

I'm scheduled to move out of my current apartment in early April.  My current management company, UDR, has reached out to me saying ""we aren't sure if we're going to allow movers in the building come early April, would you like to renew your lease for an additional 12 months?"".  When I asked them to clarify their position on movers, they said ""we don't know what our policy is going to be"".

I understand these are unprecedented times.  But prohibiting movers is a backdoor way of preventing anyone from moving out.  Additionally, I received a promotion of a month of free rent to move in initially that was prorated across the duration of the lease.  Even if they kept my current monthly rate, the lack of that proration makes the monthly price tag unaffordable.  They made no mention of a temporary month-to-month arrangement

The cynic in me believes this is an excuse to lock people into an additional 12 month lease and mitigate the financial impact of COVID on their bottom line.  Is anyone else in DC dealing with this?  Any recommendations for resources?

Each time you open the map you will see the most recent data.

The map has a number of COVID-19 related overlay layers that you can turn on/off/restack. When the map opens, it shows the COVID cases by county.  Each symbol has the data for one county.  Blue lines show county boundaries.

Please take a moment to read the **‚ÄúMap tips‚Äù**.  That link is in the upper left corner.  On that page you will find the map legend and learn (1) how to make your own custom map links, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display.

I took him to the GWU ER. When we entered the ER both of our temps were taken immediately and we were handed a disposable mask. He was sectioned off in a quarantine waiting room and I was sent to the main waiting area. At 12:30pm the ER was vacant. 

He was triaged quickly and then sent to the back. I was not allowed to join him. The physician met him quickly, and upon hearing his symptoms ordered a COVID-19 test, a chest x-ray, and an EKG. 

The test came back 8 days later. Not 4, not 5, 8 DAYS LATER. When he asked for an additional mask or gloves to take home, they told him he couldn‚Äôt due to supply. He was only to come back to the ER if his temp went over 102 or his breathing became more difficult.

I have to go from the Rockville area to Downtown DC/Gallery Place. I did it last weekend and was nervous but survived. 

I was disappointed that there were quite a bit of people. By the time I got off there was at least one person in every row in the car I was in. I intentionally went closed to the end of the train, since people tend not to.

It's difficult to know if they're from coronavirus or something else, but one thing I've noticed, that makes it a little eerie, is that these are behaving differently than usual. 

For one, they often drive slowly. There's not really a sense of urgency in their speed compared to police cars or fire trucks. So these aren't necessarily emergency patients, like heart attack victims. They have their lights on, despite their relatively leisurely pace, but not their sirens. Instead, the siren is used sporadically--usually only sounded for a second when the ambulance approaches an intersection and is about to casually run a red light, or it's blared a little longer to indicate to other vehicles that they need to pull over. 

Given the posts about New York City and the endless blare of ambulance sirens many residents are experiencing, I think DC is going a different route and ferrying COVID-19 patients around with minimal noise pollution. Personally, I appreciate it. I don't want to think about what the city would sound like when this things hits its peak.

She informed me that they have received no information about this supposed waiver of the waiting period, or these increased benefit amounts. So neither of those things would be changing for now.

3888,h2xox,1585532444,frhu51,Nan,"So I live in a house in DC and me and two other girls are on the lease. I already posted this in r/legaladvice but I figured I would try here as well, since it's specifically relevant to Washington DC. 

When we moved in, the house was huge and our landlord told us she was okay if we had a ""guest"" (her words with finger quotes) in our basement, which is essentially a private apartment with it's own kitchen and entrance. Her only rule was that there was nothing in writing and that they knew they weren't on the lease. 

We notified our landlord about 2 weeks ago that the three people on the lease came to the agreement to break the lease. The only condition of the lease that applies to us breaking the lease early is that we forfeit our initial deposit. The two girls I live with both work in the hospitality industry and got laid off and I had been trying to break the lease for a while now, so it worked out perfectly. 

We told the landlord that our ""guest"" in the basement was requesting a conversation with her because he was asking for about 2 additional weeks before he vacated the premises. He also works in a restaurant and is SOL when it comes to an income right now. We didn't give him a lot of notice to find a new place and considering the current state of things (Covid-19), so he wanted to ask if he could stay an extra few weeks until he found a spot. 

We told the landlord and she lost it. She told us ""absolutely not"" and that she refused to have a conversation with him because she has no idea who he is and he isn't on the lease.... She told us to notify him that he is required to vacate the premises by April 1, when our last day is. 

All three of the lease holders have already fully moved out. The house is completely empty except for the ""guest"" in the basement, who is now squatting. 

My question here is two parts: 
1) am I or the other two leaseholders responsible for the squatters or financially responsible whatsoever to the landlord? 
2) Can the landlord even evict the ""guest""? I know DC has some of the most protective tenant laws, and I know it's illegal to evict someone right now. I don't want to see this guy go homeless because of a heatless woman, but to her point, she has no idea who is ""trespassing"" on her property and he wasn't on the lease. 

Not an ideal situation here for the ""guest"" in the basement, and I feel terrible about the predicament we have put him into, but I have no idea what is legally applicable here.",washingtondc,Question about evictions/squatters during Covid-19

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

I went to the DMV to get a driver's license and register in early march, but they turned me away because I had the wrong residency documents. Then the whole COVID-19 thing happened, and there is no way I'm going back in the DMV before this is over. I still want to register to vote though.  I found the  voter registration form online, but I'm a little confused about whether or not I need to send in residency documents.

Housing is sublet with Best Buddies International for people with and without Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) to live together. We are fully furnishing the units and subletting them at cost to be more affordable.  All residents must have or want to gain full-time or part-time employment. Additionally, all residents will be required to participate in 3 group meals a week, attend one group activity a week and support a fellow resident when needed. Examples can include: assisting with laundry, cooking or in an emergency situation.

Happy to answer any questions you have via PM. I have unit photos too.

Please remember to be kind during these challenging times. We are all quite isolated and alone, so taking a couple of minutes to say hello to an old or new friend may mean more than you think.

I'm pretty healthy but who knows what could happen in the next couple of months with COVID-19. I would mainly be using it to fill a monthly prescription and for going to the doctor if I have an occasional severe illness (usually only get really sick like once or twice a year). 

The best option on DC Health Link seems to be the Kaiser Permanente DC Standard Platinum 0/20/Dental for $396/mo. Does anyone have experience with this plan or know if it's easy to find providers that take it in the area? Other recommendations or advice?

We are in some really scary times and I hope everyone is keeping safe and doing their part to ensure they are keeping others safe. Nonetheless, life must go on and I am deciding whether I should make the move to DC after the virus is more contained. I am considering a job offer based in the city and wanted to know if it would be a good fit for me. 

To give you a bit of background, I am currently a senior at a university in California. I was born and raised in the Bay Area and have never lived anywhere else. I am considering a trading job at an investment company, which would require me to move. I'm really excited about the opportunity and think it would be great to live in the east coast for a little bit. 

I am curious about the culture in the city. I'd say I'm a pretty ambitious, young professional type, but I'd say I'm not the overly business-ey type of guy. I love talking about business with people who are into that sort of thing but understand most people don't really give a shit. I'm not very political and find people who make it the center of every discussion to be annoying. I'm really into fitness and love the active/fitness oriented culture in the bay. So I was curious of generally how people in the city are. What do people like to do for fun? Are people generally nice? What's the vibe?

With regards to cost of living, I'm sure no where would compare to the cost of living in the Bay Area, but generally how expensive is it to live in DC. My friend recommended living in Arlington, but the apartments look pretty pricey. I'll be making \~$130k so I have some flexibility but don't really want to pay more than $1500 for an apartment. Other than rent and utilities, my main expenses would be gym, travel, and eating/drinking. Generally, how expensive are bars/clubs in the city?

Anyway, onto more important matters.  It's hard ignoring the beautiful weather outside our ~~dank, cave-like apartments~~ zen home offices, but staying in is critical in preventing the spread of this deadly virus and lessening the burden on healthcare workers.  Also, remember to support our community by [giving patronage to local businesses and donating to food banks/healthcare organizations/etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/fl9q4n/no_happy_hour_2_cherry_blossom_edition/).  We'll need our local institutions (including watering holes) intact to return to normalcy after this madness, but they need us now.

I hope everybody is taking advantage of their time inside by picking up a new hobby (no, binging Tiger King doesn't count) or spending more time with their pets.  Much to my neighbors' chagrin, my guitar playing is really coming along.  If you want to share a new or old hobby you're practicing in quarantine, post about it below.  But again, and I can't stress this enough, binging Tiger King does NOT count.

Now, more than ever, we feel that it's important to learn how to make and fix things yourselves rather than relying on working supply chains!

If you're not familiar with the Make/Fix Anything Project, we're a collection of makers, artists, engineers, bike (and other) mechanics, and computer geeks, all with hidden talents to share. We will help you make or fix anything--for FREE! The catch is, we won't do it for you; we'll teach you to do it yourself. (This is much easier to convince people of when we're working via Zoom!)

What you'll need to do is go to the FB invite and reserve a Zoom spot here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/215903322807934?active\_tab=about](https://www.facebook.com/events/215903322807934?active_tab=about)

How it will work: People will queue in the Zoom waiting room. Based on your make/fix project, you will be admitted to a breakout video session with volunteer/s specific to your project. There will also be a main video area where people can work on things independently and hang out. 

If you have some knowledge or expertise of how to make or fix certain things and want to help others, let us know! You should also let us know if you want to fix something that might require special tools or parts so we can tell you ahead of time what you need to have on hand.

Finally, we are concerned about how the digital divide will affect us. The beauty of having Make/Fix in physical locations (especially libraries) was that it was accessible to poor and elderly people who could walk in and get help. If you work at a retirement home, homeless shelter, battered women's shelter, or any other place with vulnerable populations who would like to learn and/or work on projects and hang out, please reach out to us so we can figure out a way to connect.

Non-DC residents are also welcome! Though we're DC local, with the power of technology, we can now reach out globally with friendship and knowledge. Come hang with some creative weirdos!",washingtondc,This Monday: Make or Fix Anything for FREE--Social Distancing Edition!

I hope everyone is being safe during these times. I accepted a job in DC and I am looking to move around June. I previously considered Arlington but I decided that it might be better to live on the side of the Potomac where I work. I will be working downtown by the way! My MAX budget is $1500 but realistically I would like to be around $1350 because I also have a car (unless you have advice on how to avoid these astronomical parking fees like residential zone parking etc. üòÖüò™). With this budget in mind I‚Äôve found a few places that I‚Äôm interested in: 

Rhode Island Row Apartments- I‚Äôve seen some threads about the area but I was wondering if anyone else could provide any experience with it? Safety? I‚Äôm a 23 y/o female 

AVA NoMa - I‚Äôve also seen some conflicting info about NoMa 

AVA H street 

The Edison at Union Market

I value being by the metro and some walkability! I think as long as I am close to a grocery store I‚Äôm okay. I guess I could always Uber to bars or metro or something of that nature!

4205,JenPo,1586109267,fvhzk6,Nan,"Apologies for the double post! In light of the CDC recommendations that everyone wears a mask if/when they have to go outside, the Make/Fix Anything Project is pivoting its FREE online event to center around a mask-making theme.

We will have several volunteers on-hand from the DC Mask Sewing Group who will give tutorials on the various styles of masks, materials to use, and techniques for finding the perfect fit. These are professional sewing instructors who are generously lending their time and expertise! They will also include some ""no-sew"" options for people like me who are, ::ahem::, ""sewing mechanically disinclined."" 

We will also have our mechanical gurus hanging around to help with sewing machine maintenance, fixes, and anyone who doesn't know how to set up their kit! We'll have everything you need to learn how to make masks for you, your loved ones, and should you feel like it, health care workers.

This doesn't mean that we are ONLY doing masks, however! You can still bring any project you're interested in working on and we'll help you out! We'll have several different Zoom ""rooms"" for different projects and a ""common"" room for people to just hang out, make stuff, and chat. There will also be side Slack channels for people who need individual help. You're also welcome to just hang out, chat, and watch!

When: Monday, April 6, 6-9pm (drop in anytime)

Where: Zoom and Slack. Make a reservation under the Facebook event below. OR, if you don't use FB, that's no problem! DM me your email address and we'll send you the Zoom link when the time comes. I promise not to use it for nefarious purposes.

It was loud enough for me to hear distinctly from inside my apartment and unsettling enough for me to go out to the street and investigate.  Outside it was super loud and the birds were freaking out.  After a while it just kinda lifted.

Anybody else hear anything?  I'm in NoMa, if I had to guess it sounded like it was coming from near the mall, but again, it was kinda enveloping.

4324,Froqwasket,1586269920,fwlihm,Nan,"Hello all,

I live in the Kalorama/AdMo area, on the ground floor of an apartment that borders an outdoor parking lot. We've noticed that the parking lot staff have the bizarre morning ritual of using what appears to be an industrial vacuum cleaner to soak up the dirt and 4-5 leaves from every square inch of concrete. The machine is incredibly loud, to the point of our windows shaking, and typically lasts up to 2 hours (they go over certain spots over and over and occasionally switch to a leafblower to get dirt out from underneath the cars).

My question is, is there anything we can do about this, or are we SoL? They are careful to not begin until 9am sharp every day. Previously it was an annoyance when we would occasionally have to stay home and listen to it, but now that we are trying to work from home it has become a big problem. Will the police care about this if it's during the day? Are there are rules that pertain to completely unnecessary noise?

Thanks!",washingtondc,Bizarre and loud behavior from neighbor parking lot - any advice?
