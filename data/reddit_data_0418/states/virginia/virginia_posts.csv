Any advice as to what to do to help? I’ve considered befriending this kid and offering to take the dog for walks with my dog but it seems kind of obtrusive but it kills me to hear his dog quietly cry 💔
MORE DETAILS: The pup is a German Shepard, possibly 6 months but def under a year. She is gorgeous but I know GSDs and they are very smart and have a lot of energy that they need to get rid of. This kid keeps his blinds open so I can see he sits at his computer for most of the day/night. I came home yesterday around 630 pm and saw he was at his computer as usual (his window is above the main entrance and blinds are open). I went inside and could hear his dog quietly crying from the bedroom which is on the opposite of where he sits. When I went to walk my dog, I can see all the lights on in his apt, but the bedroom door is closed and lights out. I have the exact same floor plan so I know the layout of his unit. Also I don’t mean for this to sound completely creepy for looking in his windows but I’m really sad for his pup and want to make sure it’s not sitting in a dark closet all day. Anyways, I went to walk my dog this morning at 0500 and saw the kid still sitting at his computer but I could hear the pup still crying in the bedroom. I heard the kid go to bed around 0730 and the pup was still quietly whimpering in the “closet area”. I just got home (9 pm) and the kid is at his computer and the pup is whimpering from the bedroom/closet again, very quietly but very evident. This BREAKS MY HEART to think she may be sitting in a dark closet for most of the day/night. She is an intelligent breed that needs stimulation. Can anyone think of anything I can do to help?? I know animals aren’t really protected and this kid is giving the pup food/shelter. I just wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any creative ideas that could help this situation 😢",Virginia,Dog Rescue / Advice regarding neighbor dog

There is middle ground in the gun debate whether you see it or not. Going all the way to one side or the other is not the answer. Restricting purchases to one gun per month, background checks, red flags for people deemed a danger to themselves or others; these are, for the most part, reasonable compromises that I think even the hardcore 2A community could accept. However, the Democrat proposed bills backed by Governor Northam are outrageous. If you’re telling me that my Glock handgun that I use to defend myself and my family is an illegal assault weapon because it holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition you are out of touch with reality.... Possession of a 10+ round magazine gets you a felony akin to selling heroin? Possibly no grandfather clause or having a registry of every person who owns one of these “assault weapons”?

This is why people on the pro-gun side do not trust anyone who shows a hint of gun control. This is only enforcing the classic “you give an inch and they will take a mile” stigma that makes issues like this so polarized.

These are feel-good laws written by people who couldn’t tell you the difference between an AR15 and a black takedown Ruger .22 rifle without googling it first. Not based on fact, logic, or statistical analysis. Banning these supposed assault weapons will not help public safety in the slightest. The enforcement of the laws in and of itself has the potential to cause serious civil unrest. 

Wake up people, speak up if you disagree with these proposed laws. I am sick of seeing law abiding citizens, liberals and conservatives, who stand up for their constitutional right to self defense being labeled as a ______winger or anti- this anti- that. The right to self defense should not be a completely partisan issue like the Bloombergs of the world want it to be. I do not believe that every Virginian who voted for a Democrat is on board with banning the most commonly used self defense firearms. Please stand up and say something, because at the end of the day, the crazy guy who’s breaking into your home or attempting a mass shooting at your place of worship is going to have whatever gun he wants and as much ammo as he can carry, and we will be sorry we allowed the State to handicap us.",Virginia,A Good Chunk Of The Proposed VA Gun Legislation Is Absolutely Ridiculous

As someone who voted for Trump, and deeply regrets it, I know where a lot of the Alt-Right hangs out, and I like to keep tabs on it.  Like it or not, some major American History is unfolding in my state, and nation-wide.  Anyone who have been paying attention to these particular areas and to the situation knows that The Democratic Party took all three branches of State Government for the first time since 1992.  

The entire Red areas of the state freaked out about this.  There were suddenly huge mobs of people at every County and City board meeting.  FYI, these levels of government are separate in The State of Virginia, like in Louisiana.  These people demanded that, like Sanctuary Cities and Counties, that they make their counties ""2nd Amendment Sanctuaries"".  In short, the city and county level governments agree to not confiscate guns if the State Level Government enforces a gun confiscation bill.

Especially, Local, State, and Constitutional Laws, and who has power to do what if the crux of the issue here.  If someone has also paid attention to the Civil War, you will notice some eerie parallels.

The States Seceded because of their disagreement over how much power the Federal Government has over State Governments.  They think that State Powers should trump the Federal Government's.  A very libertarian, conservative concept.  Capitalizing on this outrage and political, various factions and fake news publishers, have created erroneous articles to kick the hornets nest.  For example; stating that the Governor is going to send in the State Police, and even the National Guard door to door to look for guns.  However, the Governor, staff, and Democratic Party, have said again and again that they are not in support of gun confiscation, but expanded background checks and red flag laws.  These words fall on death ears.  

In 2017, at Charlottesville Virginia, the Alt-Right, KKK, Nazi's, and other similar hate groups came out to demonstrate,  along with various leftist groups, and it turned violent.  Eventually, at one point, a terrorist act was committed.  An Alt-Right leader, who's name escapes me at the moment, rammed a car into a crowd of protesters against the Alt-Right and other's rioting in the town.  1 woman, and 17 others were badly injured.  Police Response was slow, and the were poor containment of this issue.  I see a repeat of this, but on an even grander scale, will repeat in Richmond this Monday.

Today,[ the Governor of Virginia declared a State of Emergency](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/478336-virginia-governor-to-ban-weapons-around-capitol-before-gun-rights-rally), banning guns around the State Capitol Building, where this demonstration will take place.  The Alt-Right and other people were outraged.  I've seen so many people planning on going, and joking about that edgy Nazi and Confederate rhetoric, which is very dangerous to normalize.

On top of this, The West Virginia State Government is going to hear on a piece of legislature, [HCR 8](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hcr8+intr.htm&amp;yr=2020&amp;sesstype=rs&amp;i=8&amp;houseorig=h&amp;billtype=cr), that will allow poorer, rural counties on the Virginia/West Virginia boarder, to vote on an invitation to join the state, to get away from ""the NOVA elite"".  Frederick County, a county just under the Eastern Panhandle, will be voting on this soon.  In that county is the City of Winchester.  A fun fact, Winchester, Virginia changed hands in The Civil War 72 times over the ~5 years in the war.  This is notable, because [The City of Winchester, circled](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Winchester-Location.svg/1920px-Winchester-Location.svg.png), is a big enough city in Virginia to have a separate level of Government than the county, who has not voted on or even considered this bill.  Winchester could become an enclave in West Virginia.

[This is a proposal for a new West Virginia with the counties joining in](https://redstatesecession.org/virginia-counties-can-become-a-part-of-another-state/).  I've even heard ideas of counties from Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio joining Virginian Counties turning toward West Virginia, eventually making an Appalachia State.  A big movement is growing in my state, and I fear what it brings.

Any thoughts?",Virginia,"I feel like we're in a state of flux, and a very dangerous time as a state with this idea of Counties joining West Virginia State. Some thoughts;"

273,273,iwillhideforlove,1579487795,er6nqn,Nan,"I needed to go to the gun show in Harrisonburg today.   “You’re joking right? You’re not serious? Why are you going to the gun show?” My girlfriend asked.  

“ it’s like the circus is in town again… But this time they have the biggest scariest meanest tiger that has ever been.“ I just feel like I needed to be there to experience whatever this was... the day before these people are marching on Richmond.   

I have a lot of raw feelings and opinions, predictions, observations, and more than anything, real life experience to share concerning tomorrow and all that surrounds it. 

My sisters will call me a snowflake… Correction… They already call me a snowflake. But I am all for second amendment rights with the same common sense that applies to our application of any constitutional right and any of our laws. My views Would include a lot of undoing what the powerful NRA has done in the past couple of decades. First and foremost I am for common sense. That starts with mandatory thorough background checks. This post is an about my beliefs, But I believe I should state where I’m coming from upfront.

I know gun rights extremists… Now these aren’t everybody, but because of my family, I’ve spent time with these people, and the rage that was building when Obama was going to take their guns has only lead to deeper and deeper rage because now that we have a “good people on both sides” president, these people are empowered to embrace the ugly people they are.——ESPECIALLY when they think they are among only their own kind.  Like in a gun show.  The day before Richmond. 

What do you see at a gun show in Virginia in 2020? 
These are expected and don’t set off alarm bells: New and used guns, ammo, accessories, knives,hunting stuff, political conversations vilifying the Governor, anything that’s Trumps name can be put on. 

If this was the culture, it might offend me but it’s just that we are very different. 

But the following sights tell me that as thousands paid their 10 bux this weekend to get inside the Rockingham County Fairgrounds, ANYONE who attends and is not surprised by this is in my mind racist: 

Four or five exhibitors with nazi merchandise or paraphernalia.  Not displaying it or selling it as reverence of WWII and vanquishing of a people who tried to exterminate Jews.  It’s completely obvious that the swastika as the symbol of evil of that time means something different.  It’s white supremacy! And by the love of Trump, the GOP, the NRA, and this “get your guns while you still can” culture of these shows, the thousands streaming through the building this weekend are not just ok with these nazi sympathizers, but I truly believe the Nazis displays are the pinnacle of the moral bankruptcy of these attendees. 

Also at the gun show:

Pins, T-shirts, etc saying things like “proud to be a deplorable” well you sure are.

Among other t-shirts one that displayed  a black machine gun with the words “its Because I’m black isn’t it?”  That’s very racist. 

Whatever your opinions about the confederate flag stuff, it’s alllll over the place in there. 

Gas masks, one with a sign saying “Richmond Gas Masks”  indication they think they need to arm themselves for a riot. 

The announcement “Be sure to register for the door prize. It’s the guns the Democrats love to hate an AR 15”

I took pictures of a large nazi flag at a booth, nazi pins and coins, “whole body sniper cover” gear, and the “Richmond Gas Masks” display.  Don’t know how to attach those photos to this post.  They made an announcement not to take pictures without consent, so I asked consent to take a picture of another nazi flag display and the guy said literally that I could if I paid him 2 dollars.  

Now some Second Amendment enthusiasts will say that displaying nazi Memorabilia and merchandise is only in recognition of World War II. In that case then, isn’t it strange that there are no AMERICAN World War II memorabilia?  

To wrap up this long post, here or some final thoughts and concerns.

Over the holidays I was in a conversation with people whom I believe are in most ways good Christian people who do a lot of good in their community and I know for a fact have intelligence. Given all that, and as much as I love these people, it’s almost impossible for me to not characterize them as somebody brainwashed And under the influence of a cult. Cult culture, in fact, is what I believe I observed at the gun show today.   This conversation Was about Civil War. They believe, that is Civil War is about to begin. I said “you think it might happen or will happen?” And all agreed to the snowflake writing all of this “will happen!”  To which I replied, “if that happens,  the republic is already lost.”   And when I commented that if it was red side against blue side than the red side with no question win a hot war Because they had all the guns, “well yeah” what is the matter of fact answer, as casual as if I had just told them the sky is sometimes blue.

Finally, tomorrow in Richmond, it’s Martin Luther King day. I wanna take you back to the comment over the PA, “it’s the guns the Dems love to hate.” It’s as if these people take joy in slapping you in your face with your beliefs. That’s why, whether it happened organically or purposefully, This gun rights march tomorrow, on a sort of sacred day for civil rights… And let’s be honest… For snowflakes if they want to call us that… It’s something I think gets them juiced up even more.

They are white supremacists. To the notion that displaying the rebel flag is hurtful to African-Americans they would say that it’s Heritage and that they have black friends. I’d sure like to talk to those black friends and see how OK they are with all of this. And I can’t even imagine what even one single Jewish person, if they even attended a gun show like this, would think about all of that Nazi stuff displayed with honor as a sports bar would post an autographed jersey. I was literally sick to my stomach. 

Second amendment enthusiasts love… Underline and bold the word love… Love the phrase “Law abiding.”  On Martin Luther King day, guns are forbidden around the capital.  I hope that they obey.  

Finally, as is the case anytime someone dares use their 1st amendment right to point out the opposite opinions of those beloved beliefs you have if your sacred, uncompromising even for common sense background checks cause. “Thuguvumunt,” I’ll expect to see the comments of the Cult of The Trumper NRA trashing me in any way disrespectful way they see fit.  If you are one of those—- thus is for you before you start typing your poison tirade. 

Sir or madam, You will have a difficult time convincing me you aren’t racist, so save it. I, and many others who believe like me, many of them. DEMOCRAT GUN OWNERS, want very much to believe you support the March that led to a State of Emergency tomorrow with no racist or nazi sympathies. I’m sorry that I Hope that history shows you on the terrible wrong side of this.  But as you have read this far, if you go to the capital in Richmond tomorrow, I pray that you go with as much determination to hold the peace as you have for standing up for your gun rights. Even bumpstocks.  Even machine guns with large magazines after school shootings and mass shootings almost daily in 2019.  Stand up for that... but in the names if Jesus and Martin Luther King, please be peaceful... and law abiding.",Virginia,"Nazi sympathy at the gun show today, and a sincere prayer for peace from a snowflake"

306,306,RickGnVA,1579564223,erm1qx,Nan,"Today was the highly anticipated and highly feared annual VCDL Lobby Day in Richmond Va. State police estimate that there was 22K in Richmond today for the yearly event. Personally I think that is a conservative estimate based on what I saw on 9th Street as well within Capital Square but for a rally that typically draws 800-1000 folks I’m happy. 

About 3/4 of those there (outside the fence) were armed with all manner of sidearms and long arms.  Despite social media, mainstream media and left leaning politicians claims there was no mayhem, there were no riots, the “threats” did not materialize despite a seemingly ripe mixture of attendees according to the aforementioned parties. Everyone was jovial, smiling and having a great time.  It was a carnival atmosphere not unlike Mardi Gras (except with no booze and a ton of responsibly carried firearms).  Richmond was the most certainly the safest city in the Nation at least today. 

WRVA reported that the only arrest was a young female that refused to remove a bandana. I haven’t heard of or seen any reports of other arrests. In speaking with about a dozen police on the way out they all said there were no issues they knew of. 

When we left we as well as the attendees were policing up any trash left as well as a sea of orange Guns Save Lives stickers that fell off in the bitter cold.  I saw some scraping them off the asphalt with pocket knives. I can say that Capital Square was left cleaner than when the sun rose this morning. That act juxtaposed by the mountains trash left after Sunday’s march in DC. 

We’ll done Virginia Patriots, well done! To our brothers and sisters that came from North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Texas, Delaware and others to stand with us, thank you for your support and being here for us today. We will be there for you if needed. 

To Gov Northam, Lt Gov Fairfax, Atty General Herring, Mr Bloomberg and other legislators who would remove our rights, sorry to disappoint you today.

I recently lost my job because my company went under and due to some really bad luck with rainy days I'm really low on my savings. I'm a young adult so I wasn't getting paid very much in the first place so it's not like I ever had a ton to begin with but...it's bad now. Am in the process of filling for unemployment but apparently it takes quite a while to hear back from what I've heard.

&amp;#x200B;

I owe rent to my landlord for my room I rent out in a couple days. It's $600 and I pawned my PC recently for $200 but don't really have any other assets I can pawn out I also don't really have anyone I can turn to. I'm a bit of an introvert and I haven't spoken with my family in a while because they're pretty...toxic. Very racist, very negative, the kind of people who will step on people to get their way. Mom is basically a big Karen.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm going to be homeless soon. I haven't lived in this place very long so I don't have a leg to stand on with making him give me an eviction notice...not that I would want to, that's just a dick move. He's not willing tow ork with me because he has 4 rooms he rents out in his house, and he uses them to pay his mortgage so he can't afford to lose a months of payment, which It otally understand.

&amp;#x200B;

So...basically, I'm going to be homeless. I've never been homeless since I was a child and I didn't think it would ever happen to me as an adult but...here we are. I'd be lying to you if I didn't say I was having panic attacks and feel like I'm going to pass out at any moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I got new employment lined up, but it's going to be 2 weeks before I can take the position. (I'm a junior tradesman who specilizes in Waterjet) but suffice to say I am going to be homeless. It would take a miracle to save me from it. I need advice on here I can go, what I can do, from other people put in this situation.

* Currently the program is only for processed cannabis (e.g. oil, capsule, lozenge, spray, cream, gel lollipop, etc.)
* There is a minimum amount of CBD/THC-A per dose (5mg) and a maximum amount of THC per dose (10mg)
* Dose refers to one unit of medicine (e.g. one capsule, one spray, etc.)
* Dosage refers to how many doses in a day (e.g. three capsules three times per day)
* There is no qualifying condition list. This means that if the doctor believes you would benefit from medical cannabis, you can be recommended into the program.

Now for some background on the SB976:

* It would allow for unprocessed cannabis to be dispensed
* It will be heard Friday morning in the Senate Education and Health Sub-committee: Health Professionals
* It is adamantly opposed by Board of Pharmacy, the regulatory agency overseeing Virginia's medical cannabis program

Below are the list of Senators on the sub-committee and their numbers. Remember, you will most likely be speaking with a legislative assistant, who will be tallying calls. Feel free to call them all even if they're not your Senator.

* Senator Barker (804) 698-7539
* Senator Saslaw (804) 698-7535
* Senator Newman (804) 698-7523
* Senator Edwards (804) 698-7521
* Senator Lewis (804) 698-7506

He gave me a ticket and I didn’t realize until I looked it up that Reckless Driving in Virginia is taken very seriously. After reading a lot of prior posts about reckless driving in Virginia I understand that I need to get a lawyer to have the best chance at reducing the ticket. However in a few of the cases that I read I saw that people were talking of the possibility of jail time. I wanted to post here to find out if I should seriously be worried about the possibility of jail time in my situation. I would ask a lawyer but it’s weekend and I figure most offices will not be open until Monday. 

In terms of my prior record, I have received one speeding ticket for going 79 in a 70 when I was 17 years old back in high school. I haven’t had any violations since. I am 21 now in my senior year of college and I was driving to school through Virginia. I have nothing else on my record.

Hi All,

My dad is an immigrant from China. There are sometimes language and cultural barriers so I have been helping him with a case that has been bogging us down for over 4 years.

In 2015 my dad and I were pulled over on I-81 for going 81 in a 70 zone. He claims that we weren't going over 80 but that is irrelevant now. As many of you know, going over 80 in Virginia is considered a misdemeanor and could result in a jail sentence of up to 11 years: [https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#points\_6.asp](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#points_6.asp)

We didn't joke around and hired a lawyer to get the charges reduced to improper control/driving. We ended up paying \~2k for the court and the fines. Picture of the public records show: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/P1LC1bB6KoGPa6LQ8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/P1LC1bB6KoGPa6LQ8)

Our family felt that everything was resolved until recently when we received this notice in the mail: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/P1LC1bB6KoGPa6LQ8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/P1LC1bB6KoGPa6LQ8)

Essentially, Massachusetts suspended my dad's license based on an incorrect charge from over 4 years ago. Looks like Virginia made a mistake and send out an offense that should have been reduced.

Thus, I was curious if folks had advice on getting this resolved? Also, are there any statues of limitations for traffic violations? Seems a bit ridiculous that a charge from 4 years ago is now being enforced.",Virginia,Massachusetts suspended my dad's license for a violation in Virginia from 4 years ago

I am a new resident in VA (from Texas) and got some questions for y'all about DMV related things... 

1. I am trying to get a VA license, registering + titling my car. Can I do all of this at the DMV?  
I am planning to line up early as possible on Saturday at the Sterling location.
2. I don't have a TX title on hand as BMW Financial has it. I have to request them to mail it to a VA DMV location. It's asking for an address, name, and org name. Do I just put in the address of the Sterling DMV address and maybe N/A for contact name? 
3. Related to #2... will I be even to get all my registration + title + licensing paperwork done without the title? I obviously have TX registration, etc.
4. I see on the website that Texas Emissions is valid (I got it done Nov. 2019)... anyone had problems with this? I already got a Safety inspection but not Emissions as I saw this on the VA DMV website.

The company I work for has an opening in the Richmond area.  I would have to live somewhere around Richmond or Fredericksburg, anywhere in between is fine also.

If I get the position I will be moving with my wife and two kids from frozen Wisconsin.

I’m looking for any advice you can offer on where to live.  We like being out in the country and if we move my wife hopes to land a job at the Henrico Doctors hospital as an RN.  We are looking to commute less than an hour to that destination.  I drive from town to town for work so my commute is irrelevant.

I love fishing and duck hunting.  I see Lake Anna and that looks nice.  Also tons of rivers etc.  

I love history.  I have been to VA Beach well over ten times for work and always liked the area.  Colonial Williamsburg is still one of my favorite experiences.  Never been to Richmond.

It seems we find a lot of reasonable homes for either sale or rent in Bumpas.  Aside from the awesome name, anything wrong with living up there?

I also own several firearms that by the sounds of it may not be welcome in VA much longer.  Thoughts on what’s happening with the gun bill?  Not looking for political opinions, just curious if there is a chance they won’t be allowed shortly after we move.  We would be moving around May after the school year.

**The priority is to find a place where we have easy access to fishing/beach. A bonus would be having some historic sites, national forests, or nice towns near to visit as well.**  
I've been looking Great Dismal Swamp or Fairy Stones Park, and there seem to be tons of great options but I'm just not sure where to start. It seems like to have easy access to fishing we would have to camp at most of these spots.

Got 2.5 in savings, saving since December. State tax return that's coming is 164.

Plan on living very frugally and investing as much of my income as possible to live on passive dividend income. 

No debt, nor do I EVER plan on having any.

Either bike or metropass 0 ~ 81 

Mint Mobile 20

(Tell me cost for health insurance if I need it, IDK if I do)

And... that's it right?

700-800 per month, right?

Save the amount under 1k and invest the rest, yeah? Dividend paying stocks.




Retirement:

I don't know if this is too much. I want to retire from mandatory work as soon as possible... to pursue my passions in the arts and media. 

I'd like a plot of land somewhere, something I'd buy in cash. Plop a trailer or manufactured home that I also pay in cash, and just spend my days building a house and maybe doing random work when I feel like it. I'd be interested in working together with people to make a small community on the land we buy, and make our own town with our own rules. But eh that doesn't matter as much as Financial Independence right now. 


Also I hate debt so please don't recommend college degrees with this student loan bubble I'm sorry. 

I'd live anywhere I need to, even DC. Plop me anywhere

Jobs need on the job training or no experience required.

I can work 60 hours a week, but I hope the people would be nice... uh... yeah that's it",Virginia,Help a 19YO graduating High School figure out life!

What will happen now? Is there a way to know if I've been convicted? I heard the police might mail out a fine weeks later, but waiting for it would give no peace. What should I do?",Virginia,Accidentally passed a school bus that just extended the stop sign

“In summary, the text of the Constitution makes clear that states do not have the constitutional authority to interfere with presidential electors who exercise their constitutional right to vote for the President and Vice President candidates of their choice. The Tenth Amendment could not reserve to the states the power to bind or remove electors, because the electoral college was created by the federal Constitution. Thus, if any such power exists, it must be delegated to the states by the Constitution. But Article II contains no such delegation. Nor can the states’ appointment power be expanded to include the power to remove electors or nullify their votes. Unlike the President’s right to remove subordinate officers under his executive power and duty to take care that the laws and Constitution are faithfully executed, the states have no authority over the electors’ performance of their federal function to select the President and Vice President of the United States. And a close reading of Article II and the Twelfth Amendment reveals that the states’ delegated role is complete upon the appointment of state electors on the day designated by Congress. Once appointed, the Constitution ensures that electors are free to perform that federal function with discretion, as reflected in the Twelfth Amendment’s use of the terms ""elector,"" ""vote,"" and ""ballot."" As we now discuss, this conclusion is further supported by the circumstances surrounding enactment of the Twelfth Amendment, as well as historical practices and sources.”)",Virginia,HB 117 National Popular vote violates the Constitution

Right now Bloomberg is leading (Monmouth Poll 2/18/2020). 

I know Reddit isn't where his bastion of support lies, but tell your friends, families and share it on Facebook.

We do not need another Billionaire in the white house. The insanely out of touch nonchalance Bloomberg has shown repeatedly for the working classes shines through every time he opens his mouth. Any interview he gives, the most recent debate, it's there. 

The staggering metric fuck ton of wealth differential between his net worth and everyone else on that stage is astronomical. If you add Sanders+ Warren+ Biden+ Klobuchar+ Buttigieg and then multiply ALL of that by 2414.0625 THEN you get Bloomberg's net worth. He has no legs, elbows, or knuckles to stand on lecturing anyone about their income. 

He looks like a good choice because he's been shaping the narrative about himself largely uncontested. He hasn't had to answer uncomfortable questions before now. 

All the articles about Stop and Frisk, Muslim Surveillance, Sexual Harassment, Large Scale funding of Republican candidates do not break through to a lot of the population the way $400 million in ads do. His campaign literally smacked together cuts to make it look like he was a star debator in Nevada. Beyond the usual spin. They just added 20 seconds of silence and faces taken from other points in the debate to make it look like he nailed his opponents. https://youtu.be/SAtnM1MO8yA

I strongly urge you to get your loved ones beyond the media level of local tv syndicates.  Anyone on Reddit is already getting some form of information beyond local news. These stations are owned in a huge way by not very many companies who have a very vested interest in sharing one point of view. Get beyond Fox, CNN, MSNBC. The best thing to do is find multiple outlets saying the same things. Reuters, AP, Politico, AFP are good go to sources. Again, I just try to find it in multiple places.

Hello all,

We are George Mason students developing a new dating app called SpecUdate for people 18+ in the Virginia area!

The SpecUdate mobile Application will initially serve to help singles in Virginia to connect online! The main difference between SpecUdate and other dating apps will be that on SpecUdate, users will create their own personal ""Get to know me"" games for other users on the App to play (Two Truths and a Lie &amp; Truth or Lie). When two users connect, the result of this game will be used as an icebreaker tool before chatting. The beta version will release May 2020. We have almost 1,000 email sign ups in the Virginia area. If you are interested in the app, please sign up with your name and email at [Specudate.com](https://specudate.com/) to be notified upon beta release! Every sign up counts! Thanks of listening, you can learn more about SpecUdate at [Specudate.com](https://specudate.com/) or check us out on social media (@Specudate Instagram/Facebook/Twitter). Inquiries can be sent to [info@specudate.com](mailto:info@specudate.com).

Best,

I am originally from southern California but moved to Harrisonburg in 2018. I am currently looking to relocate and have potential jobs lined up in Glen Allen and Virginia Beach. 

I am debating on which to take and would like to know the pros/cons of each city. 

I have spent a decent amount of time in Richmond and I enjoy it and its proximity to everything, but it is still on the small side for me (obviously being from southern California). 

I have not yet been to Virginia Beach and I am planning a trip down in two weeks, but would like to know what is better for my interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I really like aviation history/military history. I know VA beach has an aircraft carrier as well as an air museum.
2. I enjoy civil war history quite a bit, it is in large part why I chose Virginia over another state on the East. I love Richmond's old charm and the fact that it has a lot more historical relevance, plus is decently close to Williamsburg which is another favorite of mine. 
3. I'm not a fan of the Pacific ocean at all, and I'm not sure I'll like the Atlantic much more, but like I said, I haven't gotten to explore it much yet. 
4. I definitely experienced culture shock moving to Harrisonburg, and am looking for more of the convenience for not having to drive two hours into a city in any direction.  
5. I want to be centered around what is happening, but also not have a ridiculous drive if I'd like to go anywhere else (I've heard of the traffic) 

Frankly I am just torn. I enjoy Richmond due to their history but I am worried about it being too small an area to have conveniences that I like, when things could be in walking distance.

To those who have or do live in either, what are the pros and cons?",Virginia,Considering moving to either Virginia Beach or Richmond

Mother. Freaking. Skrimp Shack.

I know it might sound like I'm shilling for them. And trust me, I wish. But I don't care, I just have to profess my love for them.

I visit Newport News about every 4 months (I have friends who live there) and those 4 months between trips are filled with agony as my mind can only think of those golden skrimps, that crispy whiting. The COPIOUS amounts of ketchup I drown it all in because I'm a freak.

In KY the closest thing we have are chain fast food restaurants like Long John Silvers and Captain D's that taste like they took soggy cardboard that had been lying in a puddle of grease in their kitchen and deep fried it. All of your seafood tastes way better, and I'm not even sure if it's the fact you all have access to the sea because I've been to seafood restaurants in Florida that were literally right next to the ocean that had worse seafood than in KY.

In fact, I'll say it, you all just have better food period. Most of my favorite restaurants are in VA. You all must put crack in your food because honestly it's so freaking good.

God I just wish I had a Skrimp Shack near me...",Virginia,"I'm from KY, visit VA frequently. I just wanted to say that there's on thing you all take for granted and it's..."

With numerous supposed sightings since the 1970s to present, it doesn't sound too far fetched. Interestingly, the Eastern Cougar did exist in Virginia up until around the 1880's, but The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries believes the last was killed of in Washington County around that time. I am looking for people willing to tell their stories and describe their sightings. Have any of you had a personal sighting or captures photo/video evidence that would match the description?

It looks like new employees generally get only 4, and then an extra hour every five years, so it'd take me 10 years just to get back to six. For the feds, they will match your professional experience in some situations so new hires can come in and get the same annual leave as someone who has been there for ten years. Anyone know if this is a possibility in Virginia? At some point I'll be able to ask the HR person for this potential job, but we're not quite there yet and I'm just wondering, it's a pretty big difference in quality of life, and my pay is probably going to go down at least to start if I take this job.

For one of my classes this year we must choose a political advocacy group and preform multiple different actions to support the group, one of which is a community call to action, this is that call to action.

I chose the group Represent Us which is committed to fighting corruption at a state level because they don't believe it can be accomplished at a federal level. So like many issues before, Women's suffrage, Gay marriage, Interracial marriage and soon marijuana, they plan to state by state, city by city, pass anti-corruption and anti-gerrymandering laws until they reach a tipping point where they are adopted by the federal government.

Gerrymandering allows self-serving politicians to draw their own voting districts, so they can pick their voters instead of the other way around. It’s a corrupt practice that rigs elections and takes the power away from voters.

Virginia is one of the most Gerrymandered states in the country and an amendment that would finally make gerrymandering illegal is stalled in the House — and if lawmakers don’t pass it by March 7th, we’ll have to wait another 10 years to stop gerrymandering in Virginia and there are still over a dozen lawmakers who are undecided. The Virginia Senate has already passed the amendment with bi-partisan support, and now it would be great if you agree with this cause to go to the [Represent us page on this issue](https://act.represent.us/sign/va-gerrymandering-2/) if you are feeling particularly motivated you can [Contact your local state representative who you can find here](https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/)

After claiming this would be one of THE #1 priorities for the newly Democratic controlled VA gov, (and having widespread bipartisan support in both house/senate) I’m starting to worry these clowns have managed to figure out some unimaginable way to fumble the ball at the goal line, against all odds. 

Maybe we just need to keep being patient, and it will happen in the next day or two. It just seems odd and concerning to me that they’re waiting until the absolute very last second to seal the deal. 

Is it all just buildup for the grand finale? Or will VA yet again fail to make the slightest bit of progress on this issue, despite having overwelming voter support and the legislative ability to easily make it happen.

A little background on me: I’m a 24-year old, single male, coming from a small town in a pretty rural area. I love hiking, playing tennis, boxing, taking photos, watching and talking about films, and wine. I spent 6 months in NYC for work not too long ago and the big city life is definitely not for me—although Richmond does seem very interesting and could be a good middle ground for me. 

Here’s where my head is at: I love Charlottesville because of it’s closer proximity to nature and small town feel, but I’m worried about how expensive it is and not finding a job to support that, also possibly not meeting as many people my age. I love Richmond because it feels more like a city, but without all of the negatives. Richmond feels more like the place to be for someone my age, but I’m not really a big nightlife or city person. Another thing is that Richmond would likely be a better spot for me to advance my career (I’m in the marketing field). 

The idea of Charlottesville sounds better to me, but I’m unsure if it’s what I should do at this point in my life. 

Any anecdotal advice is greatly appreciated :) Thank you.",Virginia,Charlottesville or Richmond for a single 24/m?

They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

This is not a joke. People are dying in the Williamsburg/James City County area. They were supposed to have a testing center, it got shut down within 2 days because of the lack of tests. We have a very large elderly population here and they are at huge risk. Our local economy is largely  based on tourism so its tanking HARD right now. My office is shut down until further notice, a lot of essentials at grocery stores are gone, and William and Mary evacuated campus yesterday.

Yet I know people who are still going out, they're treating this as a vacation or extended spring break. I'm in my 20s and healthy, but I'm very worried about spreading it to people who are not. I know many people who are not taking this seriously. People are traveling out of the 757 and going to public places. I'm worried about people spreading it to other places in VA, such as rural areas that don't have an adequate way to deal with this. 

If you are on the peninsula, please stay home. Don't buy more than you need, a lot of grocery stores here are empty and working on restricted hours. For people thinking it's just like the Swine Flu situation, it's not. I originally thought ""No way this will effect me, everyone is overreacting"".

I have been home sick from work watching the daily briefings from Gov. Northram and team and he is an absolute joke. He just keeps saying the same thing 'social distancing' and 'less than 10 people in an establishment.' THe people I work for have our building open for business, we have 17-19 people in our business on a given day, just employees. which half of them are over the age of 60 and can't afford to retire yet. They are going to work because they have no choice. The Governors skirting of the question yesterday about the LT Governors letter of suggestion was an absolute abomination. This Governor plans on doing nothing at all. As of today we have confirmed cases in EVERY part of virginia, and they can only test a little over a thousand people in THE WHOLE STATE because of the lack of testing kits available. It feels like The Governor is taking this shit seriously enough and it's really frustrating.

Sadly my clinic is overwhelmed so they told me to go the ER (LewisGale Blacksburg) over the phone, when I get there they did a strep test and that’s it. The test came up negative so they believe it’s just a cold and move me along.

My job has the policy during this situation that I must be without symptoms for 72 hours without any medication, or a doctors note. I had to take Robitussin since than to deal with the dry cough and sore throat which has now turned into a more substance based cough so my only bet was the ER again since my Doctor still can’t see me. This time around they were more cautious, going to the length of talking to me over the phone while in the room except to just check my heart and lungs which were done under extremely protective gear. The doctor didn’t understand why they didn’t do a flu test immediately on Tuesday but that test also came up negative and since I’m not in respiratory distress they won’t be doing a COVID-19 test. They said by Day 7 or 8 the virus will get worse, so by Monday if I’m better it’s a cold and I can return to work March 25th, if it gets worse than I have COVID-19 and need to stay quarantined till mid April.

1194,1194,wwhyareyoulikethis,1584786233,fmcz5u,Nan,"I live in the NRV area. We are surrounded by counties that have confirmed cases of the virus. **Rumors** of the virus at VT that are waiting for confirmed 2nd test results. Test results take days meanwhile possible people who have been exposed to the infected, go about spreading it themselves without even realizing they have it. 

I work in industry. The people upstairs get to work in their comfy clean homes and be safe while they preach about ""wash your hands, we care about you - *and* we also have to keep production running so *we're gonna go ahead and schedule all this* ***mandatory*** *overtime*"".

 Meanwhile production workers are expected to show up to work and work overtime and are only allowed to miss if they 1-have symptoms of the virus (aka already have it and have been spreading it for who knows how long) in which case you don't get paid or pointed or 2-have kids who's school is shut down by the virus (in which case you get to use the floating holidays so you still get paid for time off). 

So if you don't have kids but are sick (but your fever is only 100 not 100.4) you still have to work. If you're elderly - you still have to work. If you have pre-existing conditions- you still have to work. Our production isn't even ""essential"". We're not making medical supplies or ventilators etc.

They've told us that they've ""separated production as much as they can"" because if someone does get it - they're intending on making the rest of us still work because we were ""separated"". Yea the fact that we still use the same bathrooms, hallways, printers, and have people going in between groups still puts everyone at risk. It can stay in the air for 3 hours. On surfaces for 1-3 DAYS. Even if someone from nightshift has it, and then they close and dayshift comes in and breathes the same air - dayshift could get it. You can't just shut down one part and expect for everyone else to be okay. And if they're going to stress social distancing so much, why the heck are we working so much overtime - putting us in a position where we're then spending more time possibly being exposed. 

But this is how it's gonna be - not just for my place of work but multiple factories. Luckily some places like volvo and fed mogul have shut down production - but even they were laid off. **We need the Governor to shut down non-essential businesses and factories so we can stay at home and get well and mostly- figure out who has it and who doesn't so were not spreading it for days without knowing! Otherwise, we all slowly get it which will cripple factories little by little until they're** ***forced*** **to shutdown.** Regardless, companies are going to take a financial hit. People and families are going to take a financial hit. But we could at least have our health. Because **I know a lot of people who'd rather go a few weeks without pay rather than stress their bodies/minds and put their families at risk - just to end up laid off with hospital bills anyway.** I also know people who are determined to keep working because they can't afford to not work. In which case, factories should make it *volunteer* to work. It obviously won't be the same amount getting produced but it'll be something!",Virginia,[vent] Something BIG has to be done

And yet federally nothing has happened. 

And then the state level. The VIRGINIA level. Yesterday Trump said that he has “spoken” to each governor on how to create a Covid-19 response plan in their own states. Our neighbor Maryland has jumped on a rigorous and detailed plan of action to protect its working class citizens while Northam is twiddling his thumbs. He has now enacted the National Guard (which will lead to an-inevitable lockdown which dominos the negative economic impact on small businesses).Everyday of local inaction exponentially makes the situation worse. Working class Virginia citizens are losing their jobs. The unemployment application site (since the buildings are closed) is flooded and non responsive throughout the day.

- It's not just 65+. 40% of people affected are age 20-50. 

- We don't have enough mask, nurses, doctors, beds, ventilators for a moderately bad flu season let alone an infection rate of 1 in 2. 

- Even some recovered people are coming out of this with lung damage and months long recovery

- If we do nothing, there's a potential mortality of 10 million people. 25x US deaths in WW2. 
More than the population of Virginia. 

- This is all about time. Buying as much time as we can to give hospitals time to 'brace for impact'.

Drinking warm water and keeping your mouth moist is not stopping the damn virus. Drinking bleach doesn't stop the damn virus.

Stay home. It's for you as much as anyone else. 20 &amp; 30 year olds are getting extremely ill just like those over 65+. Until Northam steps up and does what SEVERAL other states have already done, we have to do it ourselves. 

For the people, BY the people.",Virginia,You've absolutely got the wrong idea about the mortality of COVID-19.

I work as an Executive Assistant and am not being given much option to telework. Up until Friday, the owner of our company said everyone was overreacting, that if anyone didn't come in they would not be paid, and I quote him twice: "" Trump will save us"" and "" The government is sending checks why is anyone complaining?""

We do not even get normal cleanings in our office, as in our cleaner is one lady and only takes out our trash. I clean my own space but just another worry some of us have. I know it is not mandatory in Virginia but it seems most non essential businesses are allowing some telecommuting. I was even told multiple times last week that I had to go get food for their lunches (not drive thru but actual grocery trips to a crowded Wegmans) and was looked at like I was crazy when I asked to not go. They also laughed when I told them the Market Cafe was closed. 

I honestly keep hearing people shaming others as to why are they going out if your not essential workers, but some people like me just have a crazy work. Maybe I am being paranoid but we have people over 65 they won't even let go home. I tried to look into if non essential employers were ordered to allow telecommuting, but didn't find much. We are a government contractor so I know we can't stop operations but everyone can work at home. On Friday they are letting our other suite do half days but our suite have to be there and they still expect us to go shopping for lunch. Getting another job isn't an option right now, just wondering is this a common thing, and maybe I am just surrounded by people who have more compassionate employers and a lot of other people are experiencing this?

Hello fellow Redditors/Virginians, 

I have a quick question regarding on claiming your unemployment benefits. I was scrolling through the r/virginia subreddit and noticed this thread, which I will include [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/fpkbv6/unemployment_question_ive_tried_calling_but_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). This person had posted mentioning something along the lines of them having to collect unemployment benefits from the state that they recently moved from. I've included that thread because I recently helped my mom file for unemployment insurance in Virginia (where we reside). If you read other people's replies, some mention that if you are an employee of a different state, but reside in Virginia, you should apply for benefits in the state you are employed in. My mom works at the National Harbor in Maryland and like many people who work in the service industry that have been impacted by the coronavirus, her hours and work activity have been drastically cut back. We received a letter in the mail this week from the Virginia Employment Commission, basically saying that her benefits are denied, due to ""no record of covered employment in base period"".  In layman terms, they could not find records of her ever working in Virginia?

 [https://taxfoundation.org/idaho-mississippi-virginia-tax-deadline/](https://taxfoundation.org/idaho-mississippi-virginia-tax-deadline/) 

Virginia is lagging behind the rest of the country in how they're helping us out with the tax filing &amp; payment deadline.  The filing deadline is still May 1 (Payment deadline is June 1, which is going to confuse some people who owe money and think they don't need to file until June 1, if they don't file by May 1, they will accrue interest on money owed between May 1 and when they pay on June 1).  Just about every other state with an income tax has delayed to July 15 to match the new federal deadline.  Virginia is not allowing us to take advantage of the delayed federal deadline because we have to fill out our federal income tax forms before we can fill out our state forms in Virginia, because Virginia bases your income on your federal AGI from your federal tax return forms.  So essentially, we as a state are getting no extension, while the rest of the country gets to July 15.

Can we expect this to change before the May 1 deadline approaches, or should I be prepared to get this all done and sorted out before the end of the month?",Virginia,"Can we expect a little more help on tax filing &amp; payment deadline, or is VA just screwed compared to the rest of the country?"

I've been in contact with both Southampton Memorial Hospital as well as 3 separate deputies of my local police department. No Coronavirus cases exist in Southampton County. The one person that died who was a resident passed away in Northampton County North Carolina. For some reason which I equate to the reasoning in my title they added it to the confirmed cases in my county. I knew the man personally, he was a teacher at my high school. On the official Coronavirus page for the State of Virginia it list 4 cases in my county and 3 cases in the city of Franklin. The first 2 cases were a mother and daughter, and the 3rd was a resident of Roanoke Rapids North Carolina, but is employed at my local Walmart in Franklin, Virginia. All 3 were in the city of Franklin.None of these new cases that are supposedly in my county have been reported on by any local news station or my local news paper (Tidewater News). The 3 cases in the city of Franklin were reported on within a very short time frame of both the patient being tested and diagnosed. I find it odd that no new news on any of the 4 reported cases in my county haven't made it in to any news publications at this point. Especially after being reported as of 9am this morning on the official Virginia Coronavirus government website.

I'm a member of all my local buy sell and trade/news groups on Facebook, friends with local officials both in law enforcement and those who are apart of our local government. I know with 100 percent certainty we have no reported cases. So, I started doing some digging. Apparently counties that report cases of the Coronavirus especially in rural areas receive increased Federal funding at the local level to combat the spread of the virus or to deal with the economic impact of the disease. In order to qualify for the additional funding you have to have reported cases in your county. A massive amount of funding is also funneled into rural hospitals mainly due to lack trauma units, and overall the lack of proper care that you would normally receive in a full staffed fully equipped hospital in a metropolitan area.

Also, one piece of information I'm lacking is who's responsibility is it to report cases at the local level? We don't have a wide variety of government officials in our county. 

Another piece of information as well. Our local hospital was on the verge of bankruptcy up until the point they were bought out by Sentara. They closed downs several wards of the hospital. They were on the verge of closing. 

Like I said I called the hospital and no new reported cases as of April the 1st in the City or Franklin, and no cases period in Southampton County.",Virginia,My county (Southampton) is reporting 4 cases of the Coronavirus that don't exist to receive Federal money from the the Cares Act.

I emailed our landlady and she said basically if we wear masks well be fine..when that's not true at all. I suggested virtual showings but she ignored my suggestion completely. 

I'm at a loss idk how to convince her to not let strangers into our home and adopt virtual showings only.

For example, Arlington County is projecting what (to me) seems to be a laughably low 1.2% hit to originally projected revenue in fiscal 2021. This appears to be totally unrealistic when you think about the hit meals taxes and sales taxes, alone, will experience, let alone the challenges unemployed people will face in paying personal property and real estate taxes along with the likely disappearance of numerous businesses.

This projected rate of decline is (laughably) low enough that the county doesn't have to make any difficult decisions just yet - it can defer purchases, freeze hiring, etc. A more (IMHO) realistic projection would require really deep cuts that impact everything from education to public safety - lay offs of teachers, cops and firefighters.

So it would seem to me that municipalities are either hoping that the state/fed provide a bailout to offset revenue loss or they are operating in a fantasyland where the economy just snaps back to February levels in the near term. 

Alternatively, they know that their budgets are going to be a complete disaster but don't want to warn about the potential fallout in ways that might cause citizens to question the current stay-at-home measures.

However, what ended up happening was my boss gave me 24 hours a week and then I picked up extra shifts to make it so I worked 32-48 hours a week. I’ve been doing this almost every week since November. I’m still classified as part-time I have gotten absolutely no benefit from it (no PTO for example).

I am given 12 hours a week admin time if there are no shifts for me to pick up which frankly, is not enough for anything. My boss has not laid me off and I doubt that she will.

* Would it be possible for me to qualify for unemployment given my situation?

I am a new construction commercial plumber from Florida who recently moved up here to VA. I moved up here and got on with one of the best residential plumbing companies in VA but realize that it forces me into being more of a salesman than a plumber. I am still with said company but am looking for some reputable commercial new construction companies to maybe get on with and would love some ideas from someone who has lived in the area more than 4 months. I am also a certified crane signaler and rigger as well as being licensed through my previous company to be a heavy equipment operator (though i know the licenses will not be applicable i do have the experience).

I got furloughed mid-March and although I have worked in Va for about 8 months I got denied due to not working a full 2 quarters. Unbelievable. 

Anyway, I applied for an appeal but was not given an appeal number so have no idea what the status is. I applied for an appeal a week ago. 

My old coworker who left my old job at the same time said she got DC unemployment. I was thinking of applying for that but was wondering 

1) How long the appeal process is and if you think it might be accepted since I have worked in Va for 8 months and was 10 days short of 2 full quarters. 

2) if I apply for DC would that be considered fraud since I have applied in two states and have an appeal open?

.

My birthday is May 1st, and with all the craziness because of COVID-19, I'd like to get out of town and do a solo hiking/camping trip to get away from everything, enjoy spring in VA, and recharge.  Ideally, I'd like to get to a waterfall/watering hole to cool off at for a couple hours as well.

.

However, because of all the closures due to COVID-19, I'm not really sure what my options are?  It sounds like most, if not all, campgrounds are closed, so I'm guessing I'd have to back-country camp, which I've never done before.  Not really sure how I feel about doing that solo, but we'll see.  That said, I'm looking for some suggestions of good day hikes around VA that I could do from Richmond, with the potential for back-country camping and waterfalls.  I've really only hiked Old Rag, McAfee Knob, and a couple spots in the George Washington National Forest....

Any suggestions?",Virginia,May 1 - Hiking/Camping with Waterfalls in VA during COVID-19?

*Disclaimer: I do not work for the VEC or any relevant employer/organization.*

This will be a continually updated thread, as I see and think of more questions and as new info comes in. If there are any errors or outdated info, please correct me!

Ask anything below!

# The Process

First things first, fill out an initial claim/application [here](https://www.vawc.virginia.gov/vosnet/Default.aspx) as soon as you find out you're being laid off, furloughed, or having hours reduced significantly, or the first day that these changes begin. It takes around an hour and asks questions about you, your work history and employment, whether you'd like to have federal taxes withdrawn automatically, and your direct deposit info if you want to receive payments that way.

After that, you're waiting until the first Sunday after your initial claim and after your first full week (as in Sunday through Saturday, not whatever your typical payweek is) of reduced hours or being out of work. You'll be receiving a letter with a PIN and a monetary determination letter, both separate, in the mail, but you can still make a weekly claim without these if you haven't received them yet, as long as you have your Social Security number. You can file online, but I recommend you call the Voice Response System (an automated phone line) instead at 1-800-897-5630. You won't talk to a person and it's adjusted for the pandemic, unlike the online claims. It won't ask you about searching for a job, and it's just a handful of yes or no questions. Using this line, you can also check the status of your weekly claims.

*If you are claiming partial unemployment, you must keep exact track of your hours or pay (before deductions/taxes) each week, whichever is easier, because you have to report this during your weekly claims. The hours you are tracking are beginning Sunday and ending Saturday of each week, rather than the payweek your employer uses.*

After this, if you place your weekly claim on Sunday or Monday and qualify, you'll likely receive payment on Wednesday. Otherwise, you'll receive it about 2-4 days from your claim. It might pend first, it might not; I've had both happen.

You must make a weekly claim each week between Sunday and Saturday (for the week prior to the week you're filing during), in order to get benefits each week.

# FAQs

**Section I: The Process**

*I live in Virginia but work in D.C. or a different state. With which state do I apply?*

&gt;Because it is the employer who pays unemployment tax, rather than the employee, you will apply in the state (or D.C.) that you work in/the business operates in, not the state you live in. However, if you work at a franchise where the franchisee listed on your paycheck operates out of state (often the case for fast food), you'll apply using your specific store as your employer, except for one question that asks you the employer name on your paycheck specifically.

*I haven't gotten my PIN yet?*

&gt;Some people are seeing delays in receiving their paperwork in the mail. Luckily, you can make weekly claims with your Social Security number instead. I recommend calling 1-800-897-5630 and filing your claim with the automated system there.

*When the weekly claim form asks whether or not I've been applying to jobs, do I say yes or no?*

&gt;The VEC has stated that no one will be flagged for either answer, and VEC employees are recommending claimants just answer yes regardless of whether it applies, to avoid have to explain later in the form. If you call the automated line at 1-800-897-5630 and file there, it won't ask this question at all.

**Section II: The CARES Act and the $600**

*Will I receive the $600 authorized by the CARES Act?*

&gt;Everyone who is receiving at least $1 in unemployment benefits qualifies for the entire $600 on top of their state benefits. It is not scaled. Some workers who do not typically qualify for benefits from the state will also qualify for this, but through a different process. See below.

*What if I'm self-employed, a gig worker, independent contractor, 1099 worker, etc.?*

&gt;You are likely to qualify under the CARES Act, but not for state benefits. If you applied and were denied previously, the VEC will attempt to contact you, so keep an eye out. If you haven't applied yet, the VEC is working on prepping the application to accommodate these groups and get them the benefits authorized under the CARES Act, but they don't have it ready quite yet. See [here](https://www.vec.virginia.gov/cares-act).

*When will I get it?*

&gt;It is being sent out starting this week. You'll see it in combination with your typical state benefits.

*Do I have to do anything to get it?*

&gt;No, the $600 is added automatically and combined with your state benefits. You do not have to do anything additional to receive it.

*Is the $600 retroactive?*

&gt;According to [this page](https://www.vec.virginia.gov/html/fpuc.html), yes. It is retroactive back to the week beginning March 29. The VEC is saying that retroactive payments will deploy ""very soon."" Previously they had said they were looking at deploying it on 4/20, so expecting it sometime next week isn't unreasonable.

**Section III: Misc**

*Will unemployment benefits affect Medicaid?*

&gt;No, Virginia is not going to factor unemployment benefits in as part of your income for the purposes of Medicaid or CHIP.

I’ve read from the law code that “Lamps are not installed on the permanent structure of the vehicle with one as far to the rear and one as far forward as practicable and at a location which is not less than 15 inches above the road surface when measured from the center of the lamp.” which may pertain to only commercial vehicles? Because that would rule out most of them where they’re mounted in the bumpers..

Also read that you can only have two lights on at same time, so maybe if headlights and a light bar are on same time that’s fine? 

Most seem to be “off-road” use, but I don’t see a problem using them if no one is in front of you or oncoming traffic on late night dark country roads for safety reasons? 

Any input would be appreciated. Thanks!",Virginia,Truck Light Bar

I got furloughed on 3/17. I work in DC but live in Virginia however i have earned wages in both localities within the last 5 quarters and therefore i qualify for UI in both. I initially filed for UI in DC as that was my last place of work. DC sent me a monetary determination and denied me claiming that I only had earned wages for the last eligible quarter, which obviously wasn't correct. It turns out that when I changed locations from VA to DC (same company) in February of 2019 they failed to update my taxes to reflect that change until July of that year. As a result I was instructed to file in Virginia. I filed in Virginia and got approved for maximum benefits. I filed for and received benefits for my first eligible week.

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to file for my second week online, I got a message saying ""Sorry! you are not allowed to file online"" and when I call the automated system it says I am unable to file over the phone because my account is suspended. I was given no explanation whatsoever for any of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to call in and reach someone on Monday evening and after some digging they discovered the problem. What had happened was, after I got denied from DC my claim was left open, so when I applied to Virginia, DC thought I was trying to collect benefits from both localities (even though they had already denied me) and they opened a ""dummy claim"" in my name in Virginia. When you have two open claims in one state, the system locks you out. The lady I spoke with on the phone said that she had to fax in the paperwork to the ""monetary department"" to have the dummy claim cancelled so I could begin filing again. That was a week and a half ago. Ive called back in 3 more times and I keep getting that same answer ""you have to wait and keep checking"".

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm convinced I've been forgotten about and theres seems to be nothing anyone can do about it. I'm stuck in limbo and meanwhile I have no food, I'm late on rent, and my phone is about to be cut off, among other things. Can someone PLEASE help me? Who can i call? What should I say when I get ahold of someone again? I just don't know what to do at this point.",Virginia,"Unemployment account ""suspended"" please help!"
