There could be trace amounts of iron in them, but nothing appreciable, and to the best of my knowledge there wouldn't be significant concentrations in one specific area (or, where the cliff dwellings are).

&gt;Overall, officials say average moisture levels resulting from snowfall are above normal across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah despite precipitation deficits that have accumulated over the last six months.

I love how there is less drought than any time in the last 19 years, but the headline wants to remind you that there is still a ""pocket of severe drought"".

The bison are in a nature preserve, so they're there all the time, but they may or may not be near the road where you can easily spot them at any given time. However, you can usually spot them on any given visit (probability around 80%) and they are often right next to or even on the road (probability about 60%). The refuge is free to the public and open from sunrise to sunset (except for certain holidays and special closures, check their website before going to make certain). The best bet is to stop in at the visitor's center when you arrive and ask them where the bison have been spotted that day. They can tell you where you are most likely to see them as well as other wildlife such as deer, coyotes, foxes, eagles and so forth. Here are a few other photos I've taken of the bison there:

The Meadowridge subdivision, with eight houses, sits only a couple hundred feet east of the train tracks and is located on a steep grade between Hermosa and Rockwood – an area known locally as Shalona Hill.

Also:

&gt;there was a second gun in his home that he was willing to surrender. On Dec. 31, the man gave up that gun as required under Colorado domestic violence law.

They go on to say the charges were dropped, yet they are going to think about giving his firearms back for a while.

Can we stop this? Like. Full stop. Snow is not a Colorado thing. Not even close. It snows in _almost_ every state in some way. Denver metro area doesn’t even get a ton of snow comparatively to many northern cities.

So “transplants can’t drive in snow” and all that crap is stupid. There’s countless other places in the country that drive infinitely better than “native” Denver residents.

In fact, snow in the front range is generally very mild and easy to deal with compared to many other places that have regular snow. It melts within a day or so. It isn’t a lot that comes down usually. It’s light and fluffy and easy to shovel. 

I can guarantee if you took many Denver “natives” and put them in somewhere like the Northeast US, New England, and most the Great Lakes areas for a winter they’d shit a brick and panic over the snow. These are areas where it’s heavy snow, the snowpack stays there for 1-2 months on end, and it’s dark all the time.",1578428116,fdhqejd

When we had snowstorms in Boston it was miserable because the snow is wet, and dense, and it stays. Eventually everything turns into a gray, wet, dirty mix of snow, ice, oil, and dirt. It gets depressing to look at. Not only that, but the tree branches become so heavy they start falling, taking out cars, homes, and power lines. I went ~72 hours without power in my Boston apartment in 2017.

&gt;I am here from Maine and I need you to know that the average snowfall inland in the mountains is 189 inches

The comment I originally replied to, was someone who thought the front range of Colorado didn’t get snow. For some reason she thought that? I know I don’t get it either.

To your point;


Yeah I’m sure Maine gets a lot of snow. The Rocky Mountains get a lot of snow. The comment you are replying to by proxy was about weather on the  front range of Colorado, and the homesick transplants that are trying to convince themselves, by any means necessary (including making up weather statistics and pretending that weather even makes a measurable difference in the quality of their life) to ignore the fact that they are struggling to succeed here, make friends, get ahead, and just all around having a hard time in Colorado.

That's not to say there isn't room for debate, but the experts you are likely referring to a politically appointed commissioners.  

The timber wolf is canis lupus lycoan and lives on the east coast.  The myth you're referring to is the introduction of c.l. Occidentalis to the northern Rockies, where c.l. irremotus had historically lived.  In truth, both gray wolf subspecies shared this region historically.  Irremotus was absent at the time of reintroduction and c.l. Occidentalis had begun the resettle the US naturally in the Midwest.  The decision to return to c.l. Occidentalis to Yellowstone and Idaho was made for a few reasons.  The lack of available irremotus wolves, the historic presence and recolonization effort of Occidentalis, and (this is the big one) they are the SAME SPECIES.  Don't get hung up on a difference of subspecies as of that's the same thing as a difference is species.  A gray wolf is a gray wolf is a gray wolf.  

In the last 100 years there have been no wolf caused fatalities in the lower 48.  Wolf encounters with humans is exceedingly rare.  There have been millions of visitors to Yellowstone since reintroduction and not a single incident has been reported.  Wolves account for roughly .02% of all livestock losses in areas where wolves and livestock intersect.  

Our public lands belong to all of us, not just those on adjacent private land.  You don't get the claim all of western portion of the state because you live in Grand junction, for example.  We all have a stake in preserving the health of our ecosystem.  Coloradans take pride in their natural environment and whether you live in Pueblo, Gunnison, or Boulder, you have a right to take action to protect that land.  

Finally, the front range vs western slope debate rings hollow.  Phone polling conducted in March of 2019 contacted registered voters throughout the state and found roughly 61% of western slope voters support wolf restoration.  

Cut through the noise.  Restoring wolves to Colorado is ecologically sound and can be done in a manner which is mindful of all stakeholders.

1157,1157,Artyuka,"They're misinformed. Look what happened in West Yellowstone when wolves were reintroduced. Riparian systems which were really struggling suddenly started to become healthier, and deer and elk populations also became healthier and more stable. The opposite of what everyone thought was going to happen, IE deer and elk populations were going to get fucked, happened. Their populations are better off because of it. 

These animals and their greater ecosystems have co-evolved over 1000s and 1000s of years, they NEED each other. They rely of the presence of each other. When you take out one of the links, the entire system is going to become less healthy and struggle more. 

This is why I think schools should implement basic ecology into their curriculum, everyone should understand the importance of ecology and how to maintain our planet. Bringing back wolves can only do good, at the cost of a few livestock here and there. If we want Colorado's environment to be as healthy as possible, this is what we MUST do. Hunters, if they knew better (and some do) would be for the reintroduction of wolves 100%.",1578525620,fdljt2i

I can't remember where I read it, but I remember reading an article about CWD is almost non-existent when the game animals also have a healthy population of natural predators in the area. I mean, wolves and elk co-existed here long before people did, so it's silly to think that wolves will decimate the population to the point where it can't recover. 

Even when you look at livestock being killed, wolf attacks make up a incredibly small percentage of livestock losses (less than 1% iirc), the majority of livestock that die are generally due to illness/injury. 

And they're generally not a threat to humans, either. I want to say that in the last several decades, the only recorded wolf attacks on humans were either due to the wolf being starved or rabid. I can't remember the speech I sat through very well, but it was like 4 total attacks in the last few decades or something like that.",1578526325,fdlkw8n

We should also run it like Montana, if they're outside of Wilderness / conservation areas you can hunt. Reimburse ranchers (cist determination should be left to 4H livestock inspector kids or something) for lost livestock too.  This brings the best of both.

It's called the Big Thompson Project.

Basically, the majority of Colorado's water falls west of the continental divide, but the majority of the residents live east of it.

So this project takes water from the west, pumps it a couple hundred feet up, and then sends it east.

Along the way it's used to generate electricity, and then it ends up in various reservoirs along the foothills.

Horse Tooth and carter Lake, for example, are man made reservoirs near Ft Collins and Loveland that are filled by Colorado River water.

1385,1385,Krexiar,"There are detractors, no doubt, and plenty of noise.  I always say wolves have to carry everyone's baggage but their own.  People project their values onto the wolf and it's the clashing of those values that produce so much divisive rhetoric around the issue.  Having said that, there's a fairly robust consensus that wolves benefit the ecosystem.  My experience is that the debate has more to do with the impact to livestock, at least from agencies like BLM and USFS.  I'd encourage you to look into the Working Circle, a group based here in Colorado which has had a lot of success in providing ranchers with the resources to minimize livestock losses to predators.  The Working Circle is not connected to the ballot effort, as they are responding to concerns whether wolves return naturally or through a political process.  I mention this group simply to illustrate that living with wolves is possible, even in our modern world.  

I have been working alongside a lot of the conservationists working on wolf restoration, including conversations with CPW and Wildlife Services.  I believe some folks don't want to see wolves restored simply because it's going to make their job more difficult, but I personally don't believe that's a good justification.  If we are able to come to a consensus that wolves are good for the land, then we ought to roll up our sleeves and figure out how to get it done.  

There's always a lot of conversation from the northern Rockies, however, about their devastating impact on wildlife herds.  In my experience, that's primarily anecdote.  The statistics paint a different picture.  Here are some numbers, pulled from state agency reports:

Wyoming - 1995 elk population = 103,448; 1995 elk harvest = 17,695.

2017 elk population = 104, 800 (31% over objective) 2017  elk harvest = 24,535, average hunter success rate = 35%; 


Montana – 1995 elk population = 109,500, no harvest data for 1995. 

2018 elk population = 138,470 ( 27% over upper objective) 2017 elk harvest = 30,348,; 


Idaho – 1995 elk population = 112,333, 1995 elk harvest = 22,400. 

2017 elk population = 116,800 (18 elk units at or above objective, 10 units below for a variety of reasons), 2017 elk harvest = 22,751. 

These are statewide figures, of course.  They are often attacked on the grounds that harvest and population numbers are down in key zones, such as the Lolo on Idaho.  Wolves are going to force elk to move; that's part of the positive impact they have on an ecosystem.  That will mean, however, that hunting may be more difficult in certain areas that may have been popular elk feeding grounds in a landscape absent wolves.  The net population of elk remains abundant and healthy in the presence of wolves.  

Happy to dig more into the conversation, if you like.  It is a tricky issue because it does represent a certain culture war, but wolves can be restored in a manner that is ecologically sound and respects the values of all stakeholders.  That's the vision we're pursuing.",1578681726,fdrakra

Still, I'm a little mixed on the topic and I think we often talk about it wrong. Sometimes people talk like a match will result in an arrest but that isn't rational. It is more likely it would be used as a way to get a lead. For instance, if I am a cop and have a video of someone robbing an old lady at an ATM and run it through a program to facial match, I get out a list of potential people. From there I go investigate those people and maybe it helps me find the bad guy (or maybe not). Of course they would need more evidence than just a match to get an arrest but it is a start.

First let me correct myself, the Southwest Ridge is the more difficult route and the South Slope route is the Easy Class 3.  This was the route we took, [South slope route](https://strava.app.link/vrqJlaVKc3)  and we parked at the fork for Governors Basin and Yankee boy basin.   I didn’t trust the vehicle we had so our hike was a couple miles longer, but if you have a Jeep or something similar with decent ground clearance and strong 4wd or AWD you’d be good to drive up a bit further to the outhouse/parking area at the lower trail head OR if you have a really rugged vehicle you could possibly make it up to the upper trailhead at around 12k feet.   

I used this route from 14ers.com and gathered all my trail condition information from there too.  You won’t be able to access it until probably late June or early July due to the snow, but it’s worth the wait.  [14ers.com route information ](https://www.14ers.com/route.php?route=snef1&amp;peak=Mt.+Sneffels)

1625,1625,bikefried,"I’d start wayyyyyy earlier. We started around 0445 that morning and took our time. I live in Denver, but my girlfriend lives in Florida so I gave her a couple days to acclimate to the altitude before we hiked it.  You do not want to be on the summit or even above treeline after noon or so. Afternoon rain and lightning storms can form quickly and you won’t have a chance to descend safely.   We made it to the summit a little before 930 that morning and that was with me taking a ton of photos along the way, thankfully my girlfriend tolerated that lol.

You can definitely camp out in several spots along Yankee Boy basin but just be prepared with warm stuff cause even in the summer it gets into the 30s at those elevations.  I would say mid to late September is when the colors really start changing there.

The advantage of motorcycling in is your riding jacket and pants are furnace warm, windproof and waterproof.

When you’re in Ouray I highly recommend visiting Orvis Hot Springs while there.

I’ve been during all the seasons and they’re all special in their own way.  We went to Orvis around this time last winter and had nearly a blizzard going while soaking in the springs.

1736,1736,Theo_Belk,"The entire point of the [1998 MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Master_Settlement_Agreement) was to consolidate multiple lawsuits to recover healthcare costs from the tobacco industry. Many states decided to participate including Colorado. As part of the settlement, the states get large sums of money annually from the tobacco companies based on sales.

When a person buys a pack of smokes, some of that money goes back to the tobacco company, which then pays some back to the states. 

Many states just could not wait to get this amazing windfall, so they sold bonds against anticipated future income. Here's the ""bummer"" part: rates of smoking have been going down since 1998. Fewer cigarettes are being sold for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the rise of nicotine vaping as a cessation method. This means projected MSA revenue is also going down and may not cover the payback on the securities the states sold. 

I don't know if Colorado did this, but California and New Jersey did and they're suffering for it. I think it's no coincidence that those states are currently the most psychotic when it comes to banning or taxing vaping while leaving combustible tobacco on the shelves.",1578943962,fea3icz

The vaping stats are not relevant. Productivity losses are, at best, a guess and not relevant. Nobody is entitled to be reimbursed for that. Productivity losses from cannabis and/or alcohol are likely higher.

If the totals for health care are correct, not all of that is automatically from indigent patients that are a burden to the state funds. People can and do pay for their own healthcare. Are you suggesting anyone who smokes is entitled to free healthcare if you get to raise taxes enough?

If alleged costs still outstrip the MSA payments and already high taxes, that is a bummer. Maybe if that money had been saved and used for what it had been intended for, smoking would be down so far that the health issues would be negligible.

But it wasn’t. Your legislators chose to grab fast cash and threw away the right to sue for more. Take your snotty attitude to them if you have a problem with it. Smoking rates are continuing down. That’s what we want, right?",1578965489,fec20yq

The baby boomers have the social security payments from gen x and y to keep them going and enough workers to keep the system working but if the population falls too rapidly gen X and later will not have social security nor infrastructure to keep them going through retirement (though with the government cutting future benifits to buy votes from the baby boomers it's likely there won't be much anyway).

1837,1837,azhillbilly,"Yes. The only other option is to cut retirement benefits and force people to retire later in life. Up to possibly making it impossible to retire. This would be by making the social security retirement age higher, eliminate the tax breaks on 401k and eliminate Medicare. 

If nobody is paying for those programs then they need to be cut. 

And you are forgetting the other part. If nobody is applying for jobs that keep the lights on and medical jobs then people who could afford to retire without the government assistance will have to pay a lot more for basic services to attract workers. Causing huge inflation issues making it even harder to retire plus increased work output from the workers that are around, probably by increasing basic work week from 40 to 50 or something before overtime kicks in.

The main reason most are against this in my opinion is using the money for another issue. In AZ the smoking rate dropped a huge amount at 2 more dollars a pack that their promised program didn't get funded and they just chucked the extra money into the general fund. If that happens in CO then suddenly we have a underfunded new program that will need a new tax to make up for it.

&gt;According to the USFWS, wolves killed a record number of livestock in 2016, including 154 cattle, 88 sheep, and one horse; that’s up from a total of 134 depredations in 2015.

To put this into context, the 2016 casualties from disease and weather alone among Wyoming’s sheep herds was 37,550 animals.

They've had it since 1776 when they told the red coats to fuck off. It's called arm yourself and prepare to protect yourself. The police Cannot and Will NOT be everywhere. The black market exists. None of the guns laws do anything to those hell bent on killing people. Does it make it harder? Sure, but that doesnt make it anywhere close to impossible. So as long as even 1 bad guy out there has a gun and is hellbent on killing a racist dom person, I'd rather be prepared to defend myself while you cower in a corner as a shooter executes you and your friends. Call me crazy. But I think preserving ones life is a good thing and I could care less what happens to criminal scum who choose to do me or others harm.

The week really got away from me.  Here are some links where you can review the elk harvest numbers for the Northern Rockies states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  I have been surprised to find that no one has done a conclusive review of ungulate populations in the face of wolf recovery, at least none that I have been able to find, but there are a myriad of variables at play, so it is difficult to pin down exactly what the wolf’s impact has been.  There is a report out of Yellowstone from a few years back that gives it an honest go, but again, it isn’t terribly conclusive.  You can find that report here: https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/ys-24-1-the-challenge-of-understanding-northern-yellowstone-elk-dynamics-after-wolf-reintroduction.htm

Hope that’s all helpful.  The conversation about wolves and elk often looks at the peak of the northern elk herd in Yellowstone, which just happened to coincide with the timing of the wolf’s release.  It is believe that the 1988 fires in Yellowstone created an ideal situation the following years for ungulates like Elk, who then peaked around 19,000 in 1994.  Today, that population is around 8,000.  Wolves have certainly had an impact on these numbers, but the real question is how much of an impact?  A 30 year average for elk in the area would place their numbers closer to 10,000.  Impacting 20% of the population seems far more likely than the 90% that’s espoused by critics, but with habitat loss and fragmentation and rising trends in climate, it can be difficult to isolate causes. ",1579203941,feknuuh

What if I wanted to go to Red Cliff, or Leadville? Much less Salida or BV. Should people in those towns just get f*cked because they're out of the way?

Further, American public transit sucks, and throwing money at it fails spectacularly (a-la the astronomically expensive high speed rail failure back home). Even in those countries, you could have to wait 20 minutes to a couple of hours to get someplace, provided they're running on time.

Given the nature of American society and capitalism, if trains worked more efficiently, we'd use them. But they don't. They take too much time, move too slowly, and stop too frequently. It takes *at least* 3-4 hours for an Amtrak to get from Santa Barbara to San Luis Obispo (100-120 mile drive, depending on what route you take)

&gt;  Uravan is an abandoned uranium mining town in western Montrose County, Colorado, United States, that is now a Superfund site. The town was a company town established by U. S. Vanadium Corporation in 1936 to extract the rich vanadium ore in the region.

In 1986 they made everyone abandon the town and bulldozed it.

2676,2676,komstock,"I'm saying it doesn't even work there. If you're *lucky* you've got to wait 20 minutes to get on the next train. If you're unlucky, you're stuck taking some roundabout route or waiting for hours until the next train comes. God forbid a rail strike happens, because then you're really screwed.

It's got nothing to do with laziness, and I know you're smart so it'll make sense why trains suck if we look at it from the perspective of economic efficiency. Let's have a little theoretical: say I'm making $30 an hour (just under CO's median of $35/hr) and live in Denver. I decide to go skiing in Vail one weekend. For the sake of this scenario, let's say a train exists. Let's say regular gas is $3 a gallon, and let's say that my snow-capable car gets 20mpg. Vail to Denver is 97 miles (rounded to 100 for the sake of this). Since there's no train, I'll use the cost of Pacific Surfliner tickets from SLO to Santa Barbara (a comparable distance), which, at cheapest, are $34 each way. The train trip takes 2hr and 30 minutes on average each way. The car trip (pending normal weather and traffic take 2 hours each way).

Let's see what happens if everything goes off without a hitch, traffic is normal, and you're by yourself:
Car: 
-$60 for gas round trip
-Departure time: whenever you want
-time cost: 4hr/$120 
Total: $180

Train:
-Tickets round trip:$68
-departure time: fixed at 2 hour intervals
-Time cost: 5hr/$150 / one missed departure: 7hr/$210 / two missed departures: 9hr/$270
Total: $218 / $278 / $338

What if you have a family of 4?
Car:
-gas cost: still $120
-time cost: still $60
total: still $120

Train: 
Tickets for 4: $272
Time cost: $150
total cost: $422
 
Oh no! I'm stuck in traffic and my drive time becomes 3:30 each way
Car:
gas cost: still $60
Departure time and stops: still whenever/wherever you want.
time cost: $210
Total: $270
(okay, so a hitchless on-time train ride beats the car here...provided you're traveling alone and are within walking distance of the station)

Regardless, the cost to build a train itself isn't worth it. One of the trains that failed fantastically back home (ironically called the 'SMART' train) cost [$944 million dollars](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/9625742-181/smart-officials-discuss-bid-to)...for 43 miles of track. For the 97 miles between Vail and Denver, it's WAY more difficult to build and engineer. But, just to illustrate how silly it would be to build, let's just use the rate for what the train back home in Norcal: $944m/43mi=$21.9m/mile 
$21.9m*97 miles=$2.129 Billion

For reference, the entire 2020-2021 CDOT budget is only $1.99 Billion. To cover the cost of the train over say, 5 years, each and every one of the 5.696 million coloradans would have to chip in $74.75 every year for 5 years. Truthfully though, not everyone pays taxes, so the cost would likely be even higher for those who do. Money for government projects comes from taxpayers, not thin air.

In closing: It's not worth it if you look at the math, and even if you're poor and trying to get to the mountains, driving (or better) carpooling with family or friends will be much more efficient in terms of time and money. This doesn't even account for additional costs like cab/uber fare between stations and homes/hotels. This doesn't account for the people required to operate and maintain the railroad tracks. This doesn't account for anyone who lives in Leadville, Fairplay, Buena Vista, or Red Cliff. Cars are more efficient from an aggregate economic sense, and I can speak for millions when I say that it's nicer than a train ride because you can maintain complete control and operate them at your convenience anywhere roads go.",1579485481,ff1syaj

And there were plenty of things in that movement that were disruptive, even mass violence became part of the equation after certain events (like King's assassination). 

I'm not trying to equate this to climate change protests, but the notions of only non-disruptive tactics being acceptable are usually supported by the same people who don't want that movement to succeed regardless. They are asking for non-disruption so it doesn't see the light of day altogether.

It would however hand the next 10 election cycles to the right and probably result in 20 steps backwards on solving the problem just to gain a single, temporary step forward.

Banning extraction in Colorado would have about the same impact on climate change as a fart in a hurricane, but it would turn out a lot of angry, rural voters for the next election.

Being one of the first states in the area to experience a “rush” (in this case thanks to the gold &amp; silver), they made a concerted effort to oust all of the Native Americans and push them into the surrounding territories. The Comanche, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe lived on the prairie. The Ute and Pueblo lived in the mountains. 

The Cheyenne were pushed into Wyoming, the Comanche into Oklahoma, the Arapahoe were split between Oklahoma and Wyoming, the Pueblo pushed down into their other territories in New Mexico, and the Utes were uprooted entirely from their mountain valleys (google the town of Ouray, named after one of their leaders) and shipped off to (you guess it!) Utah. Resistors were massacred (google Sand Creek).

Once these other territories became states, they were “stuck” with these outcast people and simply made do with them.

In 1953, the Los Angeles APCD started requiring controls to reduce hydrocarbon emissions from industrial gasoline storage tanks, thereby reducing 460 tons of smog-forming emissions per day. Subsequent rules reduced hydrocarbon emissions from filling gasoline tank trucks and underground storage tanks at service stations. It wasn't until 1978 that air quality officials required cumbersome sleeves on gasoline fuel pump nozzles to keep hydrocarbon gases from escaping when motorists filled up at service stations.

Second; this survey polled a whopping 734 people. I understand sample size and all but if it is an online survey perhaps they should consider more samples. They talk about percentages in favor by region of the state but I don’t believe they state how many respondents were in each region.

I guess I am struggling to see the value proposition to forcing reintroduction here. ‘It worked in Yellowstone to improve ecology’ seems to be a favorite line.

3327,3327,Koda_22,"The problem here is that people who like to use the old northern herd argument probably haven't actually looked into wildlife numbers, they're just parroting something they heard somewhere else. The fact is that both Wyoming and Montana have elk numbers at or above what they were when wolves were reintroduced. Those who started perpetuating the myth probably knew what BS they were selling. Take a look at this:  [https://www.cascwild.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Northern-Yellowstone-Elk-Herd-Trends-433x200.jpg](https://www.cascwild.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Northern-Yellowstone-Elk-Herd-Trends-433x200.jpg) 

Now, surely you can see the problem with that old story. First, the elk were in far lower numbers for decades without wolves around. Second, everyone who says their numbers dropped are using a brief period in time when they were vastly overpopulated and destroying the landscape vegetation as their point of comparison. The truth is the northern herd is right about at its historic average right now. This old myth needs to die.",1579965819,ffi5rfw

Yes thousands died from swine flu but the flu kills 12-61 thousand a year.

There you'll find original People and new people who have set up camps. Some of them couldn't keep up with the lacking jobs, some of them couldn't afford the rising rent, and some became addicted to drugs. But hey, at least we have pot stores and liquor stores. That way they can loose all there money to vices. You, sir, aren't the problem. My problem isn't that weed is legal, I Fucking hate drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol with a passion, but I don't think I control everyone's life and I don't want to. My problem is the stores are over saturated (as are liquor stores) and it's driving other buissnes out while taking money from people who are already unemployed and poor. All I see it as is another thing burdening this town. I also don't see it helping the schools(as when I left the one I was in a year ago it was over crowded, under staffed, and under budget) when we were told the weed money would go to improving them. That's my problem, not the fact that weed is some sort of devil product that leads to meth and coke.

Also, try getting a job as a teen in this god forsaken place. Or someone with no collage. That was a problem me and my mother had to go through for years. That causes the unemployment, no one seems to be hiring unless you know someone inside already.",1580170645,ffs17bm

Subject: The need to call for additional witnesses and documents

Senator Gardner,

Good afternoon. My name is (My name) and I live here in (Colorado City).

I first want to thank you for your service as my representative in Washington. Your position is no doubt a thankless job at times, and while you and I may not agree on a lot of the same ideas, you are a public servant, MY public servant, and I, personally, appreciate the time and work that you put in to represent me.

I am writing to express my support and determination for you to vote to call for additional witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial.

In my opinion, there is clearly additional information to be discovered as it pertains to this trial. Regardless of your views on how the House of Representatives began, ran, or voted on the impeachment of the president, as a senator it is your duty and due diligence to your constituents to vote in an informed manner on the issue of impeachment.

I do not believe you, nor anyone else for that matter, have adequate information to make that decision. Especially in light of recent news (Parnas, Bolton, etc.). There is clearly more information to uncover before a final vote should be had on the Articles of Impeachment.

I absolutely do NOT share your confidence that the President should be acquitted. In order for me to make that decision I need more information. As my representative I need you to get me that additional information.

As my senator I strongly urge you make the clear choice and vote to have additional information uncovered.

Thank you for your time and service.

Sincerely,

(My name)",1580327970,ffxm7ks

Like most Americans, I just have an expectation that during a trial the prosecution will have their witnesses, the defense will have their own, and hopefully both will have subpoenas for documentary evidence.   Our impeachment trials have always had the senate subpoena witnesses.   The people want to really know the truth of what happened.  Bring John Bolton, Bring Joe Biden, and give Trump some time under oath to tell us all his side of the story.   The truth is important, and it's worth spending time and effort on.

And anyone who thinks that having a speedy fake trial with no witnesses or subpoenaed evidence is just going to make this all go away, is sorely mistaken.  It'll make it all worse.  Coverup stories with evidence mounting in fits and spurts will last years, and keep monopolizing the news cycle all the way through this election at the very least.  If they had a real trial, it'd be over before summer, and free up a whole new topic to dominate the news cycle.  If Sen. Gardner thinks this is all going to just go away, he is very sorely mistaken.",1580338285,ffy4bfq

4010,4010,parsimo2010,"I would normally say to just go out and do it- most people of reasonable fitness can hike to the top and back between sunrise and sunset.  And it's self regulating with the altitude or blisters being the common limitations, so if you aren't able to do it you'll decide to turn around before it life threatening.  Have a backup plan for how you might get down if you get to the top too late and don't want to hike down (i.e. someone on standby that can drive to the top to pick you up).  But normally just go do it.

But right now I recommend that you wait a few months until the snow has melted off the trail, and then just go do it.  It's pretty white up there and unskilled people can get into real trouble trying to hike Pikes in the winter time.",1580528559,fg5ipt0

4013,4013,Fantastic_Fro,I did snowshoe on my way up but they wern't needed if you stayed on the path. Just wanted to test them out since I just picked them up at a thrift store up here. On my way down I just threw on my spiked and walked down (a lot faster). I can't speak for conditions right now however. I've been out of town a few days and it looks like it's snowed a bit so it could go either way.

If you have a FWD or RWD car you may be required to use chains in the winter.  Google the CDOT winter codes.

Don't advocate for perjurers and liars, or for those seeking revenge if this issue is important to you. 


I'm not convinced that red flag laws are going to be effective, but we have them. Let's see if they help.

I'm not 'anti-bicycle' by any means (I've had my gravel bike for over a decade and thoroughly enjoy getting out on maintained paths), but my reasons are generally:

Firstly, ""multi use"" trails are much more ""mountain bike"" trails than anything else, if only due to the speed at which mountain bikes go. Even on an open trail (like the Mathews/Winters Park trail I walked this weekend), where the cyclists can clearly see the hikers, bikes tend to control the situation and make it dangerous for hikers to be there. This also contributes to the degredation of a trail; mountain bike trails are built and maintained differently than hiking trails, and ""multi use"" trails are usually built and maintained to the most impactful community. In this case: bikes. That means that hikers not only feel pushed aside by cyclists bombing down (or up) a slope, but also they can feel physically unwanted on the trail. For example, on a hiking trail a turn through a bend would be short and narrow, just a hairpin turn that you can make on one foot. For a ""multi use"" or sole biking trail, that turn is wider and usually banked, making it more fun for the cyclist, but more difficult and potentially dangerous for hikers.

Secondly, [LNT principle #7](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/leave-no-trace.html): be considerate of other visitors. I know that by no means are any group of recreators a monolith, but in my experience (including being a forest ranger), the concept of yielding to the ""least able"" is all but ignored. Trail etiquette is for [bikes to yield for hikers](https://www.rei.com/blog/hike/trail-etiquette-who-has-the-right-of-way) (everyone should yield to horses for everyone's safety), and that is hardly taught to anyone. My girlfriend reminds me that when I get on my LNT rants I tend to turn into [Abe Simpson](https://tenor.com/8yQ4.gif), but with more and more people turning to the outdoors, LNT is all the more important to maintain a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone.

And finally, for the sake of wildlife, flora and fauna. Bikes can cause an undue impact on the environment (with the LNT caveat, anyone can fuck up an ecosystem regardless of their mode of recreation) due to the speed and sound of the bike, as well as the impact of the wheel tread on soft soil and mud. However, as has been pointed out every time this argument is raised, there is simply not enough evidence to substantiate my claims on the wider scientific stage. If you want to pursue this more:

4249,4249,FillsYourNiche,"If you can't get to the article:

&gt;The organization behind a ballot initiative to reintroduce wolves in Colorado said it does not support a recently introduced bill that aims to accomplish a similar goal.

&gt; The bill, introduced by Sen. Kerry Donovan (D-Vail), would authorize ""the management and, if necessary, the reintroduction of the gray wolf in Colorado,"" with a scheduled start date of Dec. 31, 2025, according to the bill summary. 
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike the ballot proposal, the bill includes provisions for delaying reintroduction until there's a source of revenue to pay for damages caused by the wolves. The bill also calls for canceling reintroduction altogether if there's a self-sustaining wolf population in the state.
&gt; 
&gt; The bill was introduced two days after Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the presence of a pack of gray wolves in Moffat County. 
&gt; 
&gt; Donovan did not respond to a Coloradoan request for comment on the proposed legislation. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund president Rob Edward said Donovan's initial bill contains “poison pills’’ that, as presently written, make it tough to swallow. His organization is the main proponent of the ballot initiative to reintroduce gray wolves in Colorado, which was validated last month by the Secretary of State’s office to appear on the 2020 ballot.

&gt; Edward said his organization opposes the bill’s reintroduction timetable of wolves on the ground by the end of 2025. The group’s ballot initiative, Initiative 107, calls for reintroduction by 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; The ballot initiative calls for the General Assembly to develop a means for compensation for livestock loss due to reintroduction. Unlike Donovan's bill, it does not call for postponing reintroduction until the legislature identifies a funding source.
&gt; 
&gt; “Those issues allow for things to go sideways on reintroduction,’’ said Edward, who said he expects the bill to open dialogue on the issue. “Our bottom line is any legislation has to be as good or better than Initiative 107.’’
&gt; 
&gt; Edward said the reintroduction blueprint has been established by previous projects in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming and there should be no further delay in returning wolves to a Colorado landscape from which they have been largely absent since the 1940s.
&gt; 
&gt; He also doesn't think reintroduction efforts are complicated by the recent discovery of a wolf pack in Colorado. 
&gt; 
&gt; Colorado Parks and Wildlife staff saw the pack of six wolves Jan. 19 while investigating an animal carcass surrounded by large, wolf-like tracks in the northwest corner of Moffat County in northwest Colorado. It was the first documented pack in Colorado since before wolves were largely shot, poisoned and trapped out by ranchers and trappers more than 80 years ago. 
&gt; 
&gt; Donovan, who is a rancher in addition to being a senator, proposed in the bill that reintroduction efforts be called off if a self-sustaining gray wolf population exists prior to reintroduction efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; But Edward said that's not likely to happen.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We still don't have an established population of wolves and ultimately won't in our lifetime given the lack of connectivity between Colorado and established wolf populations in other states without reintroduction,'' Edward said.
&gt; 
&gt; Rancher fears wolves: Reintroduction effort establishes battle lines
&gt; 
&gt; Confirmation of the pack and the hope it establishes a breeding population excites conservation groups while worrying others. Ranchers' and sportsmen's groups largely oppose wolf reintroduction.
&gt; 
&gt; Carbondale-area rancher Bill Fales said he fears a lack of fair compensation for livestock losses to wolves and the loss of grazing rights permits on U.S. Forest Service land if wolves are reintroduced. Fales' ranch is located in the heart of western Colorado where reintroduction backers hope to release wolves. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""They terrify me,'' he said. ""They can’t coexist with us. Ranchers have a pretty thin economic edge right now, and we don't need another predator pushing us over the edge. I haven't seen anywhere that compensation for livestock loss works. And when losses happen to livestock and grazing rights, you'll see this ranchland going to condos and golf courses.''

I feel we are at a tipping point in CO land management. People are venturing out in higher numbers and further into wilderness than ever before. My opinion is this is doing significant damage to the landscape and animal population that draws so many people here in the first place. 

I don’t have any good solutions to this challenge but I am curious for your opinion (or anyone reading this) on the following:

Would you support a bike licensing/registration program? Or perhaps a trail permit / registration program for trails or areas (like the Mt Evans fee for ex) for hikers, bikers, etc? The funding would be used for further conservation and management of lands.",1580778826,fgh7zv4
4254,4254,SRKingCobra,"So the ballot measure folks main issues are the bill gives too long to accomplish it (2025 vs their 2023 goal) and funding. The bill would allow postponement if funding is not identified to compensate ranchers for loss of animal. That seems like a pretty big detail, being able to pay for ranchers lost productivity. And then we can get into a whole TABOR debate if we wanted to go there...

Furthermore, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone to combat excessive herd sizes, primarily of elk. We have the opposite challenge here with our elk populations seemingly dwindling every year. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.denverpost.com/2018/11/24/southwest-colorado-elk-herds-dying/amp/

If I am not mistaken, the CPW will be reevaluating herd management plans in their regions of the state this year (they do this every 5 years I think). It will be very interesting to see what their surveys have documented of herds across the state and what they recommend as far as population goals. 

Basically; what do we gain and what do we lose by expediting reintroduction of wolves here? Guaranteed we will lose elk and deer numbers, possible to lose cattle, sheep, and the revenue associated with them. I am not so sure on what we stand to gain?",1580779757,fgh9eod

I was cooling myself off in a, uh, less than modest way. If I recall I even made and relieved myself in a cathole nearby.

No, if only because there would be no real way to maintain the level of maintenance and oversight necessary to guarantee the program is running at full capacity, including hiring, training, and retaining LEOs to enforce the program. What would stop me from making my own cow track into the RMNP (currently a mile from my home) to avoid the permit check?

Instead, I advocate a recreation-oriented Pittman-Robertson Act. As hunting and angling decrease, the benefits of the original act are decreasing as well, with nothing to replace them. Paying dues to Sierra Club and carrying a metal straw does nothing in the grander scheme of things, especially for real long-term conservation efforts. Putting a universal tax on recreational gear and materials dedicated towards conservation and preservation efforts would help not only move necessary projects forward, but would also make the recreation-industry consumers more aware of their impact, and their potential benefit to the resources they use (and abuse).",1580833923,fgiz69d

4384,4384,klyrish,"&gt;Republican Sen. Cory Gardner is a ‘no’ vote against the removal of President Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On the floor of the Senate, he said it’s an act that “would nullify the 2016 election and rob roughly half the country of their preferred candidate for the 2020 elections.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I don't believe we should be removing for the first time in our country's history, the duly elected president of the United States,” he told CPR News in an interview before Wednesday’s historic Senate vote to explain his decision.

Well there were but the dems didnt want to go through the process of going to court to force them to testify so they pushed the article's through thinking they could just have the Senate make them testify. Well guess what thats not how it works. It is the house's job to geather testimony. So in the end we have the dems to blame for this. But even if he was impeached he could have just run again. But again the whole reason we have trump for president in the first place is because the dems abused power and committed fraud when they stole the election from Bernie and gave it to Hillary. Had they not done that Bernie would have beat trump. The dems are a joke and now a bunch of cry babies. If they dont make bernie the canidate this time Trump will win again.

This was a shoot I had in mind during the early winter season. It was such a weird night in Rocky Mountain National Park. To start with, it was 42 degrees fahrenheit when I arrived at the Bear Lake parking lot. Which was so strange to me, we had a huge snow storm a week or so before. I told myself in the parking lot that I would not walk too far out on the lakes just in case they weren't completely frozen. As I started hiking, I realized there was no wind, and I needed to take off my snowboarding jacket. I hiked up to Dream Lake in a t-shirt in the middle of winter. If this wasn't odd enough, when I set up to compose this composition, all the sudden in the pitch black dark a huge crackling, ear deafening noise occurred. Within seconds after hearing it, an enormous shock wave knocked me pretty much off my feet and moved my tripod with my camera on it a couple feet backwards on the ice. Every single one of my hairs on my back stood up and I was so spooked. To this day, I am not sure what it was but guess is an avalanche that must have happened just a short distance away. It couldn't have been a jet because I didn't see one. 

Anyways, I am so happy I was able to get this composition and even more happy to find out with my eyes that it was a meteor shower night. When I got home I found out that night was the peak of the Unicorn Meteor shower. I saw so many that night and was able to capture a couple of them on camera. Dream Lake holds a special place in my heart and this is a night I will never forget.

It's HIPAA not HIPPA.  The way I always tell people is ""it's no hippo"" and then they don't fuck it up and look like an idiot more than they do already.

The blood draw results are not protected by ""doctor-patient privilege"" in Colorado for two reasons.

1. You do not need the physician to testify (that is what doctor-patient privilege is), only someone who is trained to read the results.
2. The person who is trained to read those results and the person who took the blood, the nurse/tech is not covered so they could testify if you wanted them to.

&gt;C.R.S. § 13-90-107 (d) (IV)  (""*but this paragraph (d) shall not apply to:*"" ... )  
&gt;  
&gt;A physician or any health care provider who was in consultation with the physician who may have acquired any information or records relating to the services performed by the physician specified in subparagraph (III) of this paragraph (d)

Qualified immunity has absolutely nothing to do with criminal law...  The charge would be:

&gt;C.R.S § 18-8-104 (1) (a)  
&gt;  
&gt;A person commits **obstructing a peace officer**, firefighter, emergency medical services provider, rescue specialist, or volunteer when, by using or threatening to use violence, force, physical interference, or an obstacle, such person **knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the enforcement of the penal law** or the preservation of the peace by a peace officer, acting under color of his or her official authority; knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the prevention, control, or abatement of fire by a firefighter, acting under color of his or her official authority; knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the administration of medical treatment or emergency assistance by an emergency medical service provider or rescue specialist, acting under color of his or her official authority; or knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the administration of emergency care or emergency assistance by a volunteer, acting in good faith to render such care or assistance without compensation at the place of an emergency or accident.

I didn't choose to do that, you did.

Because of you, the people making these decisions can't do it objectively, they also have to think ""but how many entitled morons will bleat if I do this?"" as well.

Lines for super bee during the week are non-existent, on non-holiday/non-powdercraze weekends 5 minutes or so for most of the day.

If you wanted to be specific the Continental Divide probably does define the Front Range vs the Western Slope but I've always seen it as a sociological distinction. Its like there's nothing that \*really\* distinguishes a Plains Coloradoan and a Mountain Coloradoan but because you live here you know we're two different breeds. The Western Slope is a rural place, full of isolated little towns, and lots of scenic beauty. The Front Range is a cosmopolitan place where all the towns broadly blend into one another up until you hit the foot hills and then, so long as you stay on I-70) you never really leave civilization.

Historically speaking, when you raise taxes for a new department or governmental venture, your taxes will continually be increased over time as those agencies and initiatives grow. When we see ""tax breaks"", all we're really seeing is a shuffling of allocations of taxes. They may cut back on some departments (like DOW funds and personnel) from time to time, but they're really just reallocating taxes elsewhere, tax payers don't see a benefit to cutting DOW. That is why increasing taxes is controversial, we don't see tax breaks as citizens, just a reallocation of tax payer money. 

We millennials have been fed a big bait-and-switch lie that we'll magically tax the wealthy and see major tax breaks. All people, regardless of your political stance, need to look very closely at tax hikes, because in 10-15 years when these programs get bloated and out of control, it's out of your pocket. You won't look back a decade and say ""ah, but it was for the good of my political beliefs at the time"", it will just be money taken from your paycheck in some way or another, and rarely has much benefit to you on a daily basis.",1581360659,fh8iumm

Whether they become bloated or not, you can only wait and see; voting against something because you think it might become bloated in 10 years is disingenuous. The shuffling of taxes also usually means that existing programs end up getting underfunded, which means they'll struggle to maintain efficiency, usually causing them to under-perform and then people will complain it's a waste of money and go ""see, they're wasting money!"" as if they weren't the cause of it in the first place. It's an idiotic self-fulfilling prophecy.

Ultimately, 99% of the people that vote on taxes won't see any meaningful increase or decrease regardless of how they voted, because they're probably below the tax bracket where any increases would start to be noticed. A massive amount of people that vote republican think that they'll somehow benefit from supposed tax breaks when, historically speaking, they don't, because they don't make enough money to see those breaks, or they don't even pay income tax because they're relying on social security, foodstamps and other socialist programs while decrying socialism as communism.

The only thing that trickles down, for any idiot that still believes in trickle-down economics, is the increased costs. Then what you have to question is the $100m+ bonus the CEOs and Presidents of such companies give themselves while the company itself is going bankrupt and laying off a majority of their employees.",1581369312,fh8xdal

The plains draw plenty of people for the same reasons the mountains do: epic scenery, hunting, camping, fishing, hiking, wildlife viewing, etc.

It's just that in the plains, they're not quite as obvious. You have to look a little harder. But it's all there. 

The issue is that the only exposure many people get of the plains is from a car window, whizzing by at 80 mph from I-70 or I-76. Or from a very brief view from DIA as they leave the airport. Of course, they are easy to dismiss as a boring, flat, beige sea of nothingness, but once you begin to venture into them, you'd be surprised at what you come across. 

I've been taking trips out the plains for many years and every time I'm met with pleasant surprises. I also love the mountains, the desert-y western slope, and well, all natural landscapes. The beauty of Colorado is that we have the choice to enjoy many different types of landscapes. Almost half the state is covered in majestic prairie, and nobody chooses to go to that part of the state. In part, I assume, it's because many people share your sentiment. Which is totally fine.

&gt;Elk numbers have been declining in Southwest Colorado, going from an estimated 19,500 in 2015 to 16,889 in 2019, Weinmeister said.

&gt;Southern Colorado is seeing lower herd numbers, he said, and there are multiple potential reasons, including a troubling drop in calf population. Meanwhile, northern Colorado herds are doing better.

2nd link

&gt;Hunters in Southwest Colorado say fewer elk and too many hunters in the forest have ruined their favorite outdoor experience, so Colorado Parks and Wildlife is seeking solutions and wants public input.

3rd link

&gt;CPW monitors two local herds, called the Avalanche and the Fryingpan herds, and both have seen declines. In the 1970s and ’80s, there were nearly 60 calves for every 100 cows; now, there are closer to 40. 

4th link

&gt;Herds in northwestern Colorado are subject to the same predators and the same diseases as their southwestern cousins, but are not suffering from calves dying in enormous numbers. 


5th link

&gt;By about 2000, the winter habitat was about as fragmented as it could be,” Millhouser said. “At this point, the **development started turning into areas that were traditionally summer habitat.** When the elk already weren’t getting the winter habitat they need, that summer habitat becomes more critical because if they can’t feed well in the winter, they sure as heck better bulk up during the summer and fall or they’re going to be out of luck.”

Your linked articles point a **regional** decline of particular herds. *Not* a statewide decline. The last one even says the issue, is too many people!

And since wolves prey upon ungulates, to make sure that wolves have food, CPW will have to work hard to create good elk and deer habitat to keep their populations up! Because if they don't, the wolves will die, and the whole reintroduction will be a failure.",1581442170,fhbh3vz

Whatever it is, it presents a much smaller risk to humans than the elk and deer the wolves would prey on.

&gt; A reasonable source for information is the world-wide study of wolf attacks on humans done by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) in 2002. The finding of the report was that **during the 100 years of the 20th century there were between twenty and thirty attacks in North America (including Alaska and Canada, which have relatively high populations of wolves). Of these, three were fatal, all because of rabies.** No attacks have been recorded in Yellowstone since the reintroduction of wolves more than a decade ago.

&gt; During the past 10 years almost 1,500 people have been killed in motor vehicle collisions with animals. Police reports on 147 fatal vehicle-animal crashes during 2000-2002 were obtained from nine states. The goal was to determine common crash types, types of animals involved, and steps that could be taken to reduce the crashes and injuries.

If that amount of money exceeds 10% of their revenue, then they no longer get their enterprise exemption from TABOR.

The argument the rancher is making in the article is completely disingenuous. He's talking about it as if wolves will kill the entire herd, not just occasionally one of the weaker ones.

There's no clarity that wolves would decimate any populations, further wolves are native to this area to begin with, so the real presumption here seems to be us thinking that we can improve the environment via extirpating wolves, not that we can improve the health of the environment by restoring them.

You referenced biology as being the end-all in a discussion about ethics. It is an appeal to nature, being that you think biology can end the discussion of the ethical ramification of re-introducing wolves. Ironically, appeal to nature is not a slight on biology, quite the contrary, appeal to nature is typically used by biologists and scientists to disregard the arguments made on behalf of science that scientists do not make. Even the social darwinism makes this point: 

&gt;Biologists and historians have stated that this is a fallacy of appeal to nature, since the theory of natural selection is merely intended as a description of a biological phenomenon and should not be taken to imply that this phenomenon is good or that it ought to be used as a moral guide in human society.

My initial quote from OP:

&gt; Coloradans refuse to vote for increased taxes to fund CPW

That was what I was responding to because it's a blatantly misleading statement. CPW doesn't get their money from taxes voted on by the public. They get their money from the sale of parks passes and hunting and fishing licenses among a few other things. 

You responded with:

&gt; Like a higher state budget couldn't result in higher funding for CPW?

That's exactly right. Money from state/local governments is capped to 10% of their revenue. If that percentage increases, they lose their enterprise exemption.

The entire point is that the voters of Colorado need to both participate and be invited to participate. The issue of wolves being ""left to the experts of CPW"" says that the status quo will remain, because the decision makers on the board are heavily influenced by industries (hunters, ranchers, etc) that want to make sure wolves are not reintroduced. 

No action has been taken. That's why this is being put to the voting public - to force the legislature to act in the public's interest instead of the interest of powerful lobbies.

And in the end, if this passes, then CPW's expertise will be able to perform reintroduction as they see fit without needing to pester voters for every nickle they need, since they are 90% self funded.

Remember, she's the one that spearheaded the creation of the CFPB and, if you read her books, she's the one that knows how the banks et al are getting away with murder (weak regulations that are enforced by underfunded agencies).

Sanders is a Socialist by his own admission. Warren, is a capitalist but one that favors strict regulations on business. When you look back at history, capitalism most fails when regulation is missing or weakened (see The Great Depression, The recession of the 90s, and the banking collapse of 2008).

Sanders would have to burn the whole system to the ground and rebuild. Warren's plans (there are so many and they are so well thought out) work within the existing system to shore it up and make sure the lower and middle classes are getting screwed over.

The truth is, the majority of american people are fed up with an economy that works to support corporations and the wealthy, while our planet is still be ravished by executives and billionaires. of course other candidates care about climate change, but the GND is the only policy that is aggressive enough to tackle what’s truly at stake here.
The goal of this policy is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change while also trying to fix societal problems like economic inequality and racial injustice. This is much more complicated of a problem than we have ever dealt with, we need a radical and pragmatic route to handle it— not the same corporate, political, BS we are so used to.

2. ""Dumped"" is even more inaccurate. The bill uses the term ""disposal"" which is defined as ""...the permanent isolation of low-level radioactive waste pursuant to requirements established by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Environmental Protection Agency under applicable laws, or by the host state.""

For me, Bernie hits it home with his broad platform that makes just about every aspect of middle/working class life better: Education, health, environment, etc. Bernie is after protecting our nation and our nations future, not about lining his pockets or those of the 1%. He recognizes how things have gotten extraordinarily expensive, yet wages have stagnated. He sees the US education system faltering. He knows our (and the planet's) air, water and ground is at serious risk.

Sanders wants to fund public higher education by imposing what he calls a speculation tax on Wall Street. This levies a .5% tax on trading stocks and a .1% tax on trading bonds. This is intended to force Wall Street to make less high-speed trades they have ""hunches"" on, as well as the supposed destabilizing influence high trading volume has on markets, as well as the view that the current system disadvantages smaller financial firms (along with the obvious benefit of raising money for public education). Because Sanders has emphasized this, I don't think he actually cares about funding public education, and just wants to punish Wall Street.

Here's Why: taxation inherently discourages behavior, so by taxing stock and bond trades, you're actively discouraging trading, which will result in trade volume dropping dramatically (which is apparently an intended effect). If the amount of trading goes down, the revenue that can be collected by taxing trading will also go down. Not only that, but a lower trade volume will lower share prices pretty much across the board in a given stock market. *Furthermore*, traders will simply move to a different market to trade stock at, and the companies will follow, further lowering the revenue that's even possible to collect by taxing stock and bond trading. 

How do I know this would happen? [Because Sanders based this plan off the Swedish financial transaction tax from '84 to '91, right down to the taxation rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax). Trade volume and share prices divebombed, and trading moved to the London stock market. The Swedish government expected 1500 million Kronor/year, but it never eclipsed 80 million, and the average was closer to 50 million. As soon as they got rid of the tax, trading volume returned and grew. 

So really, not only is his plan outrageously expensive, but he plans to fund it with a method that's provably unsustainable. The other ""side effect"" would be that it would cause substantial harm to the US economy, which, like it or not, heavily depends on Wall Street.

I wrote this four years ago. Now, Sanders has proposed this exact same thing, but now he’s tacked on paying off student loan debt with no increase in funding. How in the world does that make sense to you people that are Sanders fans?",1581602579,fhhezpe

I am concerned what M4A will do for our medical providers who are already struggling with the issues private insurance and Medicaid cause.

To fully answer your second question:
I'd trust Warren to handle health care and Student loan issues with more of a chance through Congress than Sanders.

I'm not looking for a radical change there, IBR is fine. Private student loans need restructuring. If you default there is nearly 0 interest in finding a payment plan for you. It's lump sum or litigation.

I don't think would be successful unless he had a Senate and house leadership as tenacious as what McConnell has brought on to us. The Judicial branch is going to be Regan,Bush,Trump for too long to hope to find success through litigation.

Warren is enough Wonk to perhaps get bipartisan policy out the door.

I don't even want M4A based on the issues it will cause on the provider side. I hope a candidate that pushes for a single payer, or private market insurance with protections that most countries who have such a system offer.

We're becoming a service economy, Education and Healthcare are a part of that. Without lowering the cost of medical field entry, or vastly increasing H1B worker access as a short term measure. Scarcity in care is likely to go up, and those with the ability to pay out of pocket. So initially I expect under Sanders my taxes would go up, my total health care costs will increase in the short term, and the relief wouldn't be there.

Providers are doing self pay now because Medicare and Private insurance arent competitive especially when adding the administrative time required to accept them.

Bernie isn't suggesting a Single Payer M4A, so unless there is a mandate, or incentive the provider pool for MC will not dramatically increase.

The cost of the education required and the continuing requirements to stay licensed already outweigh the benefit of the time it takes to get paneled on an insurance board, along with the hassle of accepting them.


M4Ais a great solve for catastrophic health needs. I don't see it fixing primary care, or mental health costs.

My gf and I were coming home from a road trip to Las Vegas, and on the way back took the scenic southern route. But she got sick and to save some time we skipped our stop in pagossa springs and drove late into the night to get to Alamosa. We had been driving in the rain for most of the day, basically staying right inside this massive low pressure system that had cheated us out of our Grand Canyon views (I have the unique distinction of having been to, but never seen, the Grand Canyon), so it was just pouring rain for hours and hours. We passed through Pagossa at right about sunset, starting up Wolf Creek Pass just as darkness set in. My girlfriend dozed off. And just after the first set of hairpin turns, the rain suddenly turned to thick, driving snow - literally in less than 100 yards I went from thick spring rainstorm into a heavy winter blizzard. Near the top of the pass, my girl woke up for a second, looked around, took in the giant snow banks on the side of the road and a snow plow passing the other direction, and went back to sleep.  
  And then the reverse happened - as I drove into Del Norte, the snow melted away into rain again, as if I had passed through a portal from Hoth.

 There is no difference (in the medical treatment required following a bite or in the type of bite inflicted) between dog bites by breeds stereotyped as ""dangerous"" (legislated breeds such as German Shepherds, Rottweilers, and ""pitbull-type"" dogs) and other breeds of similar sizes and strengths that are not stereotyped as ""dangerous"" (non-legislated breeds such as Boxers, Labrador Retrievers, and Bulldogs).

   * Pitt Bulls have a well-documented history of attacking other dogs.

   * Dog breeding has an enormous affect on the physical and mental characteristics of dogs - dogs bred for herding tend to be compulsive aggressive and somewhat neurotic organizers.   Dogs bred for fighting tend to be aggressive, violent and dangerous.

Football games at USAFA have a much longer window to arrive because many people tailgate before the game, and this really spreads out the load.  Even then traffic is slow going, and the stadium is almost never full (usually the Army or Navy game is the closest to selling out).

Graduation is a big deal each year, but they also arrive slower, and they only fill the west half of the stadium.  There are sometimes other events, but the biggest one I can think of in recent memory was Nitro Circus, and that only had like 20k people.

6663,6663,ndrew452,"Sure, Illinois is a train wreck; but what about the other 48 states that don't have a TABOR law and are able to have functioning economies where they find a happy medium between taxation and providing adequate services.  I swear, TABOR proponents are only able to see two scenarios, TABOR vs. the worst case.  Even California, which does have a large tax burden has a great economy. 

CDOT loses a little bit of money each year due to the gas tax.  It hasn't been raised since the early 90s.  Since the gas tax is fixed at 22 cents per gallon, it is highly susceptible to inflation, fuel efficient vehicles, and electric cars.  As a result, the purchasing power that 22 cents per gallon got you 1991 would now cost 42 cents per gallon. 

This is why government should be able to increase taxes without voter approval.  Unless it is a hyper local election, voters will typically turn down initiatives that raise taxes.  Call it tribalism, selfishness, or just not understanding how the world works, but this is what happens.  This is why we elect Representatives who have a more worldly view and work directly with other Representatives to make the entire state a better place, not just your neighborhood/city/county.  Representatives can see that a road expansion in Grand Junction will benefit the overall state GDP which will indirectly benefit someone living in Denver or Fort Morgan.  Most taxpayers don't have that view.  If you think taxpayers do, you have entirely overestimated them.  I guarantee you that if a 10 cent gas tax increase went up for a vote, it would be voted down by taxpayers, even though they would still be paying less (via purchasing power) than they were in 1991.  

If TABOR was fair, it would allow the Colorado legislature to raise the gas tax in line with inflation, and only require a vote if the legislature wanted to increase the tax higher than inflation.  

My post is very narrow in view, but it shows just one example on how TABOR has hurt the state. There are many more.

I'd also like to point out that wanting the state government to provide better roads, school, and services is not an ""ultra-lib"" viewpoint.  Conservatives, liberals, and centrists have this viewpoint, but dismissing those who want TABOR nullification or modification as ""ultra-libs"" is counter productive and discourages intelligent conversation because it implies that you dismiss the notion out of hand and won't or can't see the other's viewpoint.",1581908982,fhw8foi

Another point to consider, is many people are moving to Colorado from warmer climates, like Texas &amp; California.

7000,7000,beniciodeltrollo,"Spanish in origin. Most of it, anyways. Cattle herding goes way back throughout Europe, though. Herding livestock in North America had been done by Anglos as well out east on smaller scale, but it wasn't until the 19th century when Anglos arrived that the Spanish tradition of herding with lassos, wearing chaps, and going on long cattledrives on the open plains became a distinct culture unto its own. By the end of the 19th century, cowboy culture very much had its own culture that blended Anglo/Spanish culture. We now see it with cowboy poetry and Western slang and sayings. But also anyone who goes to rodeos, spends any time along the border, and knows about the history of Chisholm Trail and Texas is entirely aware that Spanish/Mexican and Anglo American culture ultimately combined to create what we now recognize as ""cowboy"" culture. Prior to the arrival of Anglos and their newfound taste for beef, being a ""cattleman"" was not a big industry in Texas and Mexico. The growth of the United States is really what created the modern idea of the cowboy. 

A lot of cowboy lore owes its legacy to the Civil War. There was a massive migration west, many of them were black and looking for a fresh new start on life. So throughout Texas and the west you had white Americans who were pro north, pro south, former black slaves, colonists from Mexico, Native Americans, and many people coming from around the world simply to experience this new frontier. It forged an entirely different culture as a result of coming into contact with Mexico and Texas (which had its own culture by the late 19th century).

To say Hollywood whitewashed cowboy culture is just as lazy as Hollywood's attempt to recreate that small era on screen, Anglo expansion westward was the catalyst that brought all of it together. Prior to whites settling across the plains, the Spanish and Natives had mainly just resorted to border warfare and skirmishes. Spain and Mexico were unsuccessful in their colonization of Texas, and only found success by hiring Anglo empresarios to colonize the territory. That was a double edged sword, obviously, as Texas would go on to secede entirely. Eventually he famous cattledrives across the plains became so well known across the world that they were something of an early agro-tourism attraction. A well known Italian aristocrat, Leonetto Cipriani, came to the US to do a prolonged cattle drive and recorded the entire trip.",1582218335,fi7btwe

My qualm with your whitewashing history is that you're unironically whitewashing history. Hollywood wasn't wrong by depicting many (or all) of the characters in spaghetti westerns as being white. There was no shortage of outfits who were just Anglo American whites out on the trail. Likewise, many of the outlaw and bandit culture of the west were just a bunch of white guys who created gangs to rob, pillage, and kill across the west. In fact, many outfits were well known pro-Confederates that had no qualms about their blatant dislike of blacks. There were also many outfits that were white simply because, well, a lot of people who settled the west were simply white. The west was a diverse place, but in some instances it really wasn't diverse at all, so Hollywood wasn't necessarily wrong in depicting a white (or even racist, pro-white sentiment) in films. You're just upset that they were depicted as heroes and not bad guys. History is what it is, filled with all the best and worst of humanity.

&gt;It did not acknowledge the importance of people of color in the history and narrative of American expansion.

Have you ever watched old spaghetti westerns? I feel if you had, you'd know that this isn't even true. As clichéd and historically inaccurate as they may be, they did have complex stories, and they don't always involve stories of good-white-man-bad-brown-man storytelling. Quite the opposite, many of them portrayed an equally unfair representation of the ""noble savage"" and the corrupt, immoral white outlaw.

So again, you're just advancing clichés as you try to tilt the windmill.",1582220267,fi7f9yz

&gt; Four recent studies have found that up to half of the drop in the Colorado’s average annual flow since 2000 has been driven by warmer temperatures. Now, two U.S. Geological Survey researchers have concluded that much of this climate-induced decline — amounting to 1.5 billion tons of missing water, equal to the annual water consumption of 10 million Americans — comes from the fact that the region’s snowpack is shrinking and melting earlier.

After three siblings were diagnosed with measles at Children’s Hospital Colorado in December, public health officials began tracking down 258 other patients who visited the emergency department that day and were potentially exposed to the disease.

It took most of a week, an estimated 3,600 hours of staff time and about $300,000. 

Here is what Senate Bill 163 would do:

— Under current law, parents who want to exempt their children from immunizations can write on a sticky note or even a napkin and hand it to their school office. This bill calls for a standardized form.

— The information in the exemption forms would go into a confidential statewide database to help public health officials protect people from an outbreak. The database would include personal information but would be subject to federal health privacy laws.

My biggest point is that you can't argue and go after a group (anti-vaxxers) who (right, wrong or indifferent) in their opinion are making the healthiest choice for them and their loved one(s) and then turn a blind eye to tobacco smokers who either can't deal with stress in a healthier way or worse they just enjoy a hobby that slowly kills them and those around them. That's just ignorant. And if we start making laws for anti-vaxxers i sure hope we do for tobacco users. TBH i's about time people who smoke cigarettes start being just as ostracized in society.

7127,7127,beniciodeltrollo,"&gt;Hi, Spaghetti westerns were filmed in Spain by Italian directors.

Hi. You are correct, not all ""Spaghetti"" westerns were filmed on the Italian Peninsula, but across the western Mediterranean—including Spain. And since we now have a newfound penchant for technicality, some were also shot in Sardinia. I probably don't need to remind you that the namesake didn't come from nowhere. 

&gt;They are also 20-30 years after Classical Hollywood so you're neither in the right era of filmmaking or group of filmmakers.

Classic Hollywood is roughly and era that goes up through the 60s. If you want to change the definition and time period to better suit your argument, okay, take it up with the screen actors guild or something. 

&gt;Sergio Leone for instance was literally confronting the whitewashing of the American West narrative built by filmmakers like John Ford in Hollywood and hence had a diverse cast and included new topics like the role that women and sex workers played in colonial expansion.

Why you are now arguing against your very own original hackneyed comment is only a mystery. Covering up the reality of female prostitutes in the Old West was not a matter of whitewashing anyways, but of social norms in the first half of the 20th century. I don't even know that there was an intentional covering up of prostitution, it's just as likely that early films didn't cover that subject matter for the sake of social norms. In any case, it has nothing to do with the topic at hand. 

&gt; I don't know a single film scholar who refers to Spaghetti Westerns as Classical Hollywood. (I have 2 degrees and 7.5 years of university in film studies and 4 years of teaching film studies at unis.) I'm going to leave you to your argument now, because you're annoying and your sense of intellectual superiority is both obnoxious and unearned.

I don't really care what your degree is in or how many film degrees you have, your original argument was that Hollywood whitewashed the American cowboy. Now you're just shifting the goalpost to one about the technicalities of Hollywood nomenclature, and trying to make it a case of who is more qualified to speak on the topic. Hollywood was not historically inaccurate by portraying nothing but white cowboys. It may not be the portrayal you prefer, it may not be the history you want to tell, but it wasn't inaccurate. This was originally a thread about the historical nuances of the Old West, you served up, ate, then regurgitated your own clichés by lambasting Hollywood ignorance and then demonstrating your own filmmaking pedigree.",1582305186,fiaocua

7137,7137,blonddy,"I upvoted your comment rightfully so and appreciate your questions. I can only give my opinions; I haven't done my own research on vaccines and although I'm in healthcare I'm not that schooled by any means. As for those parents I don't believe they should be more ostracized than people who smoke cigarettes. I think people focus on this and forget some other, possibly bigger evils in our world. All those things you speak of are awful and some dangerous.
 #1; Companies that contribute to smog shouldn't be allowed to by law just like citizens can't burn certain things because of polluted the air.
#2; In an ideal world, where there aren't any anti-vaxxers fast food doesn't exist either. But for now fast food by law should be held to higher standards, well all our food really. Especially that in the grocery stores.
#3; I think if there were higher wages and better prices people would feed their children better. Pepsi shouldn't be $1 for a liter and $2.00 for a bottle of water or $5 for a shitty pizza and either the healthier pizza choice or the ingredients are $10+. But unless your planning on going into healthcare their diet isn't going to really effect your physical well-being like say anti-vaxxers or tobacco smokers. Now if you are planning a career in healthcare the heavy ones feel extra heavy after your 8 hours into a 16 hour shift and the paper work is enough to make a your eyes go blurry.
#4; Cutting down real trees should be illegal; again in an ideal world.
#5; Mothers who drink while pregnant are POS because I can't think of a lower term at the moment and there are laws to work against their actions; even some being detained by a court order until they give birth.
#6; Again In an ideal world that kind of recklessness would have consequences (how would you keep tabs I  can't imagine) and in an even more perfect world batteries and such things that are so bad for our environment wouldn't even exist; solar 🌞 everything.
#7; Another ideal/perfect world scenario, anti-depressants wouldn't be a thing.  Rather natural medicine and physical remedies would be and all of Big Bad Pharma would be out of jobs.

The only other point I think is relevant to your comments is that people who smoke cigarettes are ostracized, and rightfully so. In many places in Colorado is is against the law to smoke in public or within (I believe) 15 feet of business entrances. I know people who didn’t understand this legislation yet were ordered to pay $100 fines nonetheless. It is also against the law in some places for parents to smoke around their children, for people to smoke indoors, even around others who wish to do so. In airports, all the smokers are forced to huddle together, isolated from those who do not, to avoid affecting others. They pay higher healthcare premiums to offset their cost on society. They pay higher taxes on cigarettes than other products. They face social stigma all the time.

I also believe many of these examples should be enforced similarly on people who, without sound medical reasoning, refuse to vaccinate their children against serious preventable contagions.",1582312285,fib0so3

7492,7492,mountains_forever,"I disagree, friend. 

I’ll start with the obvious argument against it: since 1973, 165 people have been exonerated who were sentenced to death. That’s a shit load of innocent people that just got really unlucky. That could be you, your mother, father, best friend, etc. Do you want to live in a world where that is a possibility? 

Even if we could prove - with absolute certainty - that a person committed a murder/rape, do you still want the government to have enough power to sentence that person to death? Do you want the decisions of judges/lawmakers to be 100% in control of the outcome of anyone’s life?

From a non-religious point of view, putting the convicted person to death allows them “take the easy way out.” No possibility for rehabilitation. No possibility for life in prison reflecting on what they did. No possibility for doing good in the future. Just lights out. Don’t exist anymore. Done. You know how we, as a society, get pissed at mass shooters for taking their own life? What’s the difference between the Vegas shooter taking his own life at the scene of the crime and the state choosing to do that a few years later? I’d rather that person live with the fact that what they’ve done caused them to sit in a cell for the rest of their life. 

On top of all of that, the cost required to keep someone on death row is huge compared to an equivalent person with life in prison. Additionally, due to the high consequence, death penalty cases are around 4x more expensive than non-capital punishment cases. Most of that bill is paid for by me and you, the tax payer. 

To me, there are no positives to the death penalty.",1582767342,fivsx6g

7504,7504,BlackMetalBanjo,"Fair points.  So of those 166 cases, some were exonerated due to wrongful convictions.  Some of those were then re-tried, some committed a different crime that landed them right back in jail.  Some died in prison before their sentence was carried out.  Some were taken off death row and had their sentences reduced.  It’s a gross over exaggeration and pretty much wrong to say that 166 people were innocent.  Our justice system isn’t perfect and most reasonably intelligent people know that.  

To answer your questions:  that would be terrible to see someone you know convicted but I’d guess it’s worse seeing someone convicted of killing someone you know, like you said your mother, father, beat friend , etc.  and have their sentence reduced because some people think that the deaths they committed aren’t bad enough that it’s inhumane to punish a person in the same way.  

Do I want the government in control of a persons life?  No, but they are an integral part of it regardless of the crime.  You get judged by a jury of your peers for crimes.  You go to court for speeding tickets.  Governments involved either way and I’m not fond of them removing things piece by piece.  

No, I’d rather see a person that’s committed heinous crimes be given the same thing they decided was ok for them to do.  To me, sitting in a 6x8 jail cell and spending the rest of your life doing the things prisoners do, when it comes to major crimes like murder or rape, isn’t enough.  It’s not like people have to sit in a room 24 hours a day being fed only bread and water for the rest of their lives so they can think about what they did, I’d probably be ok with that. 

Yes, I recognize that taxes go towards all of this, I’d rather pay more for someone to be expeditiously removed than to sit and live the rest of their lives doing what they’ve done.  

The bottom line is it comes down to a question of ethics for everybody.  Moves like this aren’t going to help reduce crime.  If anything it will increase because the death penalty served as a decent deterrent.  In my opinion anyway.",1582807447,fiwy7bh

&gt;Denver averages 30 days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees each year, based on a long-term average dating back to the 1800s. Since 2000, though, that number has spiked to 48 days of 90 or above. In 2018, Denver reached 90 degrees or above 59 times.

And since you still can't seem to grasp the difference:

**Weather**: the state of the atmosphere at a place and time as regards heat, dryness, sunshine, wind, rain, etc.

**Climate**: the weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period.

“[‘Hegemony or Survival’] begins with the discussion by the great biologist Ernst Mayr, who [makes the point] that intelligence seems to be a kind of lethal mutation,” Chomsky explains. “If you look through what’s called biological success, what allows the species to survive and proliferate, turns out as you move up the scale of what we call intelligence, capacity to survive declines. So the species that are really very successful are beetles, for example, which have a fixed niche; they never change. Everything changes, the whole world changes, but they stick to their niche and keep reproducing and they’re fine. … As you move up to … bigger mammals—their capacity to survive declines. What about when you get to humans? Well, you could argue that … we are now proving Mayr’s thesis. Not so much for the reasons you mentioned, which are bad enough, but we are racing to destroy the possibility of organized human life. And it’s a cooperation of those who call themselves the best and the brightest, and the Trumpian boors … all racing toward disaster, perfectly consciously, a great testimonial to human intelligence. And that’s only the beginning.”

Some years frogs are more abundant than others in Colorado simply due to spring runoff—there's more standing water for tadpoles to mature. Mass extinctions of animals in various places are the result of urbanization and an exponentially growing population that pollutes, it is common sense. You do not need to rely on anecdotal story about how someone thinks they used to see more frogs when they were a kid, memories are unreliable for scientific data anyways. And it shouldn't need to be mentioned, but the causation for fewer [perceived] frogs 20 years ago in Colorado does not necessarily correlate to the larger trend of amphibians dying off worldwide. In fact, amphibians are dying off across the world for different reasons (pollution, drought, habitat loss, cuisine, etc).

And on top of that, everyone will step back and re-evaluate. Land prices will go down for one thing. More multi-unit dwellings will be built.  

&gt; On top of that, he has to pay every trade working on the job less too.

I just suggested it because for PSA'a to work we need to reach people and these days that *HAS* to include social media/mobile devices in some way.  People are excellent at ignoring even useful information because we've been training ourselves to look past visual interruptions to the information we seek.  

The QR codes that have worked for me - to spark my interest - were those that looked like they'd give me more information about something I was already doing.  

For example, while in the Netherlands I rented a small electric boat and on the steering console there was a QR code with the word ""map"" in a few languages. When scanned it brought me to a website where there was a map of the nearby canals. (We later discovered that the map also had points on it that would lead you to QR codes out in the real world that when scanned would give you more information about a certain area.) It was a GREAT system because it was context specific and location specific.  

A sticker at a trail-head, in a rental car, or hotel room with something simple like, ""Going Hiking?"" or ""Going Snowshoeing"" and a QR code MIGHT get people to take a moment - even if out of curiosity - to learn something.",1582907592,fj0tsn3

We foster dogs and frequently bring them hiking. Most of our fosters are former strays who don't know how to greet on a leash, and become aggressive when a strange dog comes up to them on a trail.  That dog is then much harder to re-home because we have to be honest about bites/aggression events. It's not fair to put our fosters in that situation because you're too lazy to hold a leash.

That's the reason the BSA sells popcorn, season lasts for like a month every year around thanksgiving. It covers the cost of the scouts dues and goes towards the troop's yearly recertification, then the state council takes their cut (since they supply the product in the first place). 

As far as I know the GSA states that its doing the same thing, but in reality ist only a small percentage that goes towards the girls at the local level. They make such massive profits that in reality the majority goes towards the backing corporation, not the local troops.

I have a good job with good, and cheap, employer sponsored insurance. I dont want Medicare for all because my current insurance is better. So why should I have to pay more for worse health insurance?

&gt;In any case, an increased minimum wage will raise your annual salary in the future.

I'm salaried, so no, it wont. Also, that doesnt even make sense with basic economics. 

70k+ is good. But I'm already paying about 45% of my income to taxes as it is. I'm middle class but I'm certainly not rolling in the dough. My wife and I opted to only have one kid because we couldnt afford a second.

How will he address that shortfall? Either by putting the country even deeper in debt or he will raise taxes. The claim that Bernie is going to pay for his socialist paradise by just raising taxes on the ultra rich is a fairytale. The math simply doesn't work out. If he wants to pay for this, he's going to need to tax everyone middle class and above at a rate of 50%+ just like his favorite countries [Norway, Sweden and Denmark do](https://money.cnn.com/interactive/pf/taxes/top-income-tax-rate/?iid=EL). Here is the salary where the top tax rate kicks in for each of these countries:

* Denmark: Top tax rate of 60% kicks in at $54.9k
* Sweden: Top tax rate of 57% kicks in at $65.5k
* Norway: Top tax rate of 40% kicks in at $88.6k

These are all middle class incomes. Even if you don't make this much, these are hardly incomes that would qualify as ultra rich.

So that would be 1 electoral vote for every 600K people. Right now Wyoming has 1 vote for every 200K people where California has 1 vote for every 720K people. This would make it so all of our votes still matter and are all equal.

[According to Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/06/a-closer-look-at-who-does-and-doesnt-pay-u-s-income-tax/), people who make over 200k annually make up only 4.5% of the population, yet pay 58.9% of the federally collected income tax.  If you add in the 12.3% of the population that makes over 100k annually, that goes up to 16.8% of the population paying 80.6% of federal income taxes.  And thats before you add in property taxes, capital gains taxes, bonus taxes, sales taxes, ect.

This is what the last two presidents have promised to do and have failed. Thanks to Citizens United and no term limits, getting Democrats to start changing the legislature and judicial is a joke. Why should a ""Bernie Bro"" (which is a sexist/racist term that makes women who support Bernie invisible, so you may want to stop using that narrative) and other progressives in the party fight to change the system?  Progressives have been fighting for change for the past 30 years and have seen nothing to show for that fight.  Republicans win because it's easy to unite the right. It's difficult to unite the left when ""neoliberals"" and ""New Democrats"" have controlled the party.

Laissez-faire economics has decimated the middle class and exacerbated the income inequality in this country.  You are more likely to obtain the American Dream in another country like Denmark than you are in America.  Does it sound sane or educated to you to continue making the same mistakes that were made in 2016, 2012, 2008, and so on?

Our country has been on the decline for years and it has happened under both parties watches.  Our life expectancy is now on the decline and has been for about the past 10 years.  Other modern countries are in absolute shock when they see how much we have to pay just to have a baby at a hospital, or the price of an epipen, and so on.

Changing the system starts with the party, and it starts with the caucuses and primaries.  The legislature and judicial branches are beyond corrupt thanks to citizens united and rampant gerrymandering.

Changing the system is going to take people getting angry enough to speak up and speak out against the dangers of neoliberalism and incrementalism.

Climate scientists argue we have less than a decade to make major systemic changes in order to reverse the global warming trend.  We don't have time to have peoples snowflake feelings get hurt because your feelings won't matter in 10, 20, 30 years if scientists predictions come true.  And there is no reason to believe they won't.

Progressive taxation is simply unjust. There's no other way to describe it.

It amazes me how people have swallowed this rhetoric. Using terms like ""rent seeking"" demonstrates YOUR conditioning. It doesn't say anything about the situation.

The irony is that promoting progressive taxation is picture-perfect example of rent-seeking. You are seeking to manipulate public policy for profit. The hypocrisy is impressive.

On second thought; do you even know what the term means? I've heard it completely misused in the past. Are you aware it primarily deals with the manipulation of government policy, not anything that much resembles rent?

Also, for the record, concentrations of wealth (which necessarily mean wealth disparity) is a fundamental necessity and driving force of all social progress and prosperity.

And they are taxed on all of that.  The top bracket for capital gains is literally 20%, or 1/5th of every dollar made.  There is property taxes for renters and owners, and everyone pays interest.  Yes.  The rich get richer.  They make the life and economic choices that allow that to happen.  They also contribute more to our nations federal and state revenues than everyone else.  By a massive margin.  

&gt;A progressive tax system is perfectly sustainable considering you still have enough money to actually live, and do not have to take on three jobs just to barely make ends meet.

The problem is that you are pushing to make it a regressive system.  Right now we literally have less 20% of the nation bankrolling the services that the remaining 80% use, and in many cases, at a very disproportionate rate.  

&gt;Income inequality is actually increasing, with the top 1% taking in most of the bounty.  

Whats your point?  Millionaires like Bernie Sanders, who own 3 homes, arent taking one from a poor person.  Thats not how the system works.   Its not like taking property from the CEO of burger king is going to suddenly make the guy flipping burgers more fiscally responsible with his money.  

&gt;The top 1% should be paying the major share of tax considering they have also stifled wages for almost half a century.

Not really.  They pay what the market demands they pay.  Its not ""stifling wages"" if that low skilled worker can be easily replaced with another worker.  Wages are based off of the economic value that the employee represents.  If you want better wages, you need to be more valuable.

That's more than a fourth of the world's entire wealth stashed in secret banks, not moving, not being invested, not speeding up innovation, and not being taxed. It's all tax evasion and money laundering. The biggest problem in the global economy today is that the richest families and institutions have convinced many of the poorest ones that taxes don't work while actively funding a global machine of tax evasion and policy buying. The narrative that higher taxes are the problem is simply a fallacy perpetuated by people who are already tremendously wealthy and, crucially, those who have deep aspirations to be.

The real issues are the all the forms of tax evasion, legal or illegal, that hide a 1/4th of the world's GDP and the rampant propaganda campaign against any public spending in a time when inequality seriously off-kilter. Mind you, inequality, generally speaking, is expected on a certain level in any functional economy with a relatively free market. Think of this as rungs on a ladder. A ladder with reasonably spaced rungs is useful and not psychologically impeding. Anybody with sense can tell that a ladder where the rungs are 5 feet apart is not functional and dangerous. Anybody can understand this metaphor, especially in the US. 

People with extreme wealth --- I'm not talking about a ""single lakeside summer house wealthy"" either. I'm talking, ""private jets and mansions on different continents while never cooking your own food"" kind of wealthy -- these folks actively both evade taxes through armies of lawyers, all the while spending even more money in order to influence policy-making thus making the first step easier. This is not a static problem either. It's a ramping-up, growing, worsening machine that will cause geopolitical disruption on a catastrophic scale if not dealt with. No one is safe or happy in a world like that. To sum up, you being from Chicago (same as me, lets go blackhawks), is not evidence that you understand taxation at all, and moreover the experience of a single tax policy in a city well-known for its local political corruption is not evidence that can be used to justify either avoiding or lowering taxes. Higher taxes have literally never once been an impediment to improving the quality of life in the US. 1960 US Government had a marginal tax rate at 91% for incomes over $200k per year. This kind of policy is what funded huge scientific efforts like the Moon Landing as well as the free college education of the greatest fighting force in American history.

But yeah - total tax burden above 30% is a total pain in the ass. $160k isn't ""rich"" money, especially not in Colorado, especially not for married filing joint, and especially not with 4 kids.

Wages are not really based off of the value that the employee represents and you would know that had you worked an actual job.  Ever had a job where someone else takes credit for your work?  If you evaluated, really evaulated, what each worker does at a job, even if they made the same wage they would have different level of output.

Trump only ended — or suspended — what Trump had started, and that was after a judge ordered that the practice be sharply curtailed and as an international uproar grew.Moreover, the American Civil Liberties Union now says in a legal challenge that [more than 900 children](https://apnews.com/ba5a05e6a7f14b6b898d75712dee1f6b) were separated from their parents at the border in the year after the judge’s order.The Obama administration also separated migrant children from families when a child’s safety appeared at risk with the adults or in other limited circumstances. But the ACLU says children have been removed after the judge’s order for minor transgressions by the adults, like traffic offenses, or for unfounded suspicions of wrongdoing.

No one gets rich on a public salary by being honest.  Bernie has had a tax payer funded lifestyle for half a century, with virtually no actual political accomplishments to show for it.  

No market is truly free.  But pretending that a government controlled market is a better option has been proven to lead to economic ruin.  Letting the people vote for who has wealth and how much they take from it has failed, literally every time it has been practiced.  

&gt;Bernie Sanders is rich because he got lucky and has a high IQ, really.

No.  Bernie is rich because he has fleeced the tax payers for nearly 4 decades, while pretending to be a public servant.  No one gets rich on a public salary by being honest.  Bernie has had a tax payer funded lifestyle for half a century, with virtually no actual political accomplishments to show for it.  

&gt;I don't think rich people understand  that the middle and poor classes drive the economy, considering they  will spend everything they make.  If people don't spend money, then  there isn't an economy.

You would be wrong.  The economy is funded by investment and spending.  The rich absolutely understand that.  That guy on the factory line pulling a lever all day is replaceable.  Thats why he gets minimum wage.  Anyone can do his job.  Hell.  A machine can do his job. Thats why he gets paid a low wage.  Because it costs almost nothing to replace him.  Meanwhile the guy running the marketing department for the same company can either make or break the company with the right or wrong add.  His value is significantly greater than that guy on the assembly line.  

&gt;  Most low level jobs do not compensate for increased output, so why would the average worker care? 

Who cares?  They made themselves replaceable. Economic value of labor isnt measured by how many hours a person shows up and clocks in for.  Its measured by how valuable and how irreplaceable an individual is to his employer.  The market adjusts to that.  If you want to be paid something significant, you have to be worth something significant.  If your only goal in life is to show up and put in 8 hours, dont be surprised when your retirement plan is completely based off of how much SS is paying, assuming the system is still fiscally solvent.  

&gt; Wages are not really based off of the value that the employee represents and you would know that had you worked an actual job.

Private wealth allows for greater diversity of endeavor and that is good. Public wealth attracts corruption and that is bad. Some public wealth is necessary but it should be limited to ONLY that.

I don't know how you spent the three weeks of the Senate Trial but I found myself unemployed so I got to watch all public proceedings. Did you know that the Democrats had the entire timeline of the alleged Abuse of Power down to the minute? They had supporting documentation, testimony, and corroboration that not only did the President do what they said he did but that his own defense was ""I did it, but it wasn't impeachable"". Constitutional Scholars showed historical precident that this sort of situation is exactly what the Framers sought to prevent with the Power of Impeachment. The Dems had the Motive, the Opportunity, and the Gun.

The only missing piece of evidence was The Witness-- a person who could say ""The President told me, to my face, to hold the Aid to Ukraine until they announced the investigation of the Bidens"". Too bad Bolton didn't get called to the stand. 

The only sham was that you ""Conservatives"" abandoned your responsibility to uphold the law and spirit of the law in this land to play party politics. I've spent my life being a middle of the road independent, ""There are good people on both sides"" kind of guy but I saw in that trial that to the Republican Party, and to their voters, the only thing that matters is Trump. Gardner could have voted to remove the President along with all the other Republicans, doing the right thing, and guess what!? You'd still have a President who proudly wears a GOP sticker on his lapel. I don't hate Trump because he's a Republican, I hate him because he's an awful person and not worthy of the office he occupies but what we've seen is that its more important to have Him in that office than any other Republican. 

Again, I'm not saying you're wrong for being a Conservative. I'm not wrong for saying you're a Republican (probably). I'm saying you're wrong for burying your head in the sand and closing your eyes to the character of a man who has done nothing in his life except cheat, bully, lie, obfuscate, and defraud other people but its a SHAM when someone tries to hold him to account. He's made no attempt to hide the quality of his character but you rabidly endorse him. That's okay though. In eight months, or in the worst case in 4 years, he'll be out of office and we can start to pick up the shattered pieces of this democratic experiment. We'll have to deal with the new reality though that its entirely appropriate for any President to ask a foreign nation to conduct politically motivated investigations against their domestic rivals but I'm sure we'll manage.",1583511165,fjnnqpr

I’m assuming based on what you’ve described, you work for a medium-large sized company (please correct me if I’m wrong). I imagine that a similar policy would wreak havoc in small companies under, say, 10 people. Imagine you’re the owner of a company of 5 people. Offering paid family leave means unless everyone else is picking up the slack you’re paying double for that position for 4-5 months by the time you account for training and transition back and forth of responsibilities. So yeah, while many, maybe most companies could afford it, there will be a lot of small businesses that this would have a major impact on. 

Also unless there’s an unlimited vacation policy like your company, how will people who don’t want kids feel? Some will be fine with it sure, but some are gonna be resentful of people who get extra time off simply because they chose to have kids. And maybe your employer is great about the unlimited vacation policy, but I imagine there are many managers out there who will take exception to a single, childless, employee taking what they see as 3 months of “unjustified” vacation, in addition to their normal vacation days.

I saw the Republican defense back into a corner and say ""yeah, but asking for an investigation isn't impeachable"". They didn't deny that the aid had been conditioned on the investigation of the Bidens. 

Also, I can tell where you get your information because as the front man on Ukraine Biden did what every other European head of state was already doing and called for the Ukrainian head prosecutor to be dismissed on charges of corruption. The conspiracy that Hunter was benefiting from his father's position and that Biden had acted to protect his son from investigation for corruption has been widely disproven over and over and over and over and yet keep harping on it. 

So we're left with one side saying Biden is corrupt and be investigated (but we know that's untrue) and the other side saying the President literally asked for a politically motivated investigation of the Dem Front Runner and we have all the evidence to prove it minus Bolton's testimony.

Okay, explain to me how landlords provide the rental value to their tenants that's equivalent to their wage and/or profit based income.

If Joe Blow goes to has to work 1 and a half weeks as a contractor, @ 8 hours/day, how is that equivalent to a landlord who spends just minutes a month managing their properties since it was managed for them?


Public wealth is as bad or good as the integrity in the system. It's at an all time low, and people are trying to make out like bandits before the next economic down turn that could possibly be a depression. The more power someone has, the more corrupt they can become, so its safe to assume that several millionaires would be better than one billionaire who has immense power.  When several firms have to compete for the working person's dollar/employment, its to the benefit of the society.  But with centralized power there less incentive to cater to the whims of the market, and thus you get less innovation and less value per dollar spent on good and services.

Corrupt capitalists like to use McDonalds as an example of an ideal free market exchange, but they don't factor in the cost of obesity and health care costs.  A brilliant example is the real cost of a 20oz bottle of soda is actually $6 when health care costs are factored in.  People that drink soda are much more likely to get type 2 diabetes. Have you ever been in a dialysis clinic before?  It's very depressing and I bet the people there would not drink soda had they known it would cause them to be have to be hooked up to a machine for 2 hours a day because the price of soda was being subsidized by the public at large and partially the government. If people went to the store and had to pay the UPFRONT price of a good, they would recoil at a soda and get a coffee or tea.

Id be fine with a flat tax personally, although I doubt that would ever actually happen.  People who get to live in our society should have to contribute.  The fact that a tiny percentage of this nation essentially bankrolls the rest of the nation is not sustainable.  

&gt; You might have some sort of a point if ""tax and spend"" were somehow worse than ""borrow and spend."" 

Democrats like to tax and spend.  Republicans like to cut taxes and spend.  The problem isnt the taxes.  Its the spending.  We spend FAR more than we can take in, and have been doing so for decades.  Its one thing to run up a deficit on occasion.  But we have made a habit of it. Even the Clinton ""balanced budget"" only did so by borrowing from mandatory spending (ie, not included in the annual budget).  We havent had a true financial surplus in decades.  Republicans suck, but Democrats want to MASSIVELY increase that spending.  To unsustainable and unsupportable levels.",1583544542,fjp8na8
9553,9553,TheRightOne78,"Thats probably the most base level and naively simplistic analysis of the economy you could make.  Ya.  The economy is based off of goods and services.

Its those INVESTMENTS that make up most individual IRAs and corporate 401Ks.  Because thats how most financially literate Americans plan for their financial futures.  

Look at this last week

\-Corona virus affects US imports from China- Stock market massively drops.  

\-Biden brutally beats Sanders in Super Tuesday- Stock market rebounds. 

\-US Job growth report- stock market back up.  

\-Corona virus report- Stock market back down.

If it were as simplistic as you advocate, the economy would be doing fine, based off the spending alone, as people stock up on stuff for the Corona Virus.  Its not that simple.

""For the N95 to be truly effective it has to have a proper seal and then be worn continuously. Barron said she wears them in a clinical setting and that after half an hour it's challenging to breathe in the mask.
""It literally, like, seals on your face. There's no gap. No air is coming through. It's right on top of your nose and under your chin,"" she said. ""There's no way you're going to wear that on a seven-hour flight.""

So, neither the surgical nor the N95 mask is going to keep you from getting sick, but what about people who are already sick?""

Soo they say n95 masks help when worn properly, but they are uncomfortable.

 Then next sentence says they dont help. Well wtf? 

And for the record, me and many other people have worn them for 7+ hours in polluted areas.. They should be changed at some point if you are using them for coronavirus purposes but that's some wacky logic.

9617,9617,fannypacks_are_fancy,"Yes. Absolutely, 100% yes. Last year some dude with mental health issues was seen walking down the street in our downtown area with a rifle. He wound up shooting 3 people and they all died.

Seeing people carrying guns is fucking terrifying to anyone who’s not the person carrying. And fuck anyone who thinks their right to brandish a firearm is more important than my right to not be afraid for my life while grocery shopping, or a kid’s right to feel safe at school.

9619,9619,WhiteRaven42,"&gt; Okay, explain to me how landlords provide the rental value to their tenants that's equivalent to their wage and/or profit based income.

Can you re-phrase the question? Equivalent to who's wage etc?

In a majority of cases, landlords are serving loans that were used to acquire the property. Like any busies owner, what they charge has an underlying margin. The profit they make can be quite small.

A person paying rent is doing so because they haven't established themselves in a way they can afford a mortgage on their own. So, the landowner takes the risk of the loan but spreads the risk by having multiple tenants. From time to time, they will have empty properties or difficulty getting payment. That's another cost/risk they face.

That is the service landlords provide. They accept risks and operate on a margin while providing comparatively easy access to housing. Comparative to purchasing a home yourself that is.

It is not labor they are being compensated for. It is financial risk they are being compensated for. And their compensation is likely less than you think.

&gt;Public wealth is as bad or good as the integrity in the system

True but the problem is, political systems possess no integrity. They are designed from the ground up to provide at BEST grossly inefficient solutions. From that best case scenario, it just gets worse as corruption gets involved.

&gt;It's at an all time low

Actually, it's not. It's at an all-time... average. It's is exactly as dirty and pointless and wasteful as it ever has been.

&gt;The more power someone has, the more corrupt they can become

Agreed 100%. Why the HELL do you want government to have more power then?

&gt;so its safe to assume that several millionaires would be better than one billionaire who has immense power.

Money doesn't confer power; it confers influence.

Influence means having means to persuade people to do what you want. That's not power.

Power is the ability to FORCE people to do what you want even if it is against their will. ONLY government (or violent criminals) has power, not rich business people.

Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have less power than your local city council member.

Please make distinctions between force and persuasion. It is a vital distinction. Like the difference between slavery and employment. Or rape and love.

&gt;but they don't factor in the cost of obesity and health care costs.

Because there's no reason to. ""externalities"" are an invention that is essentially fraudulent. A lie born of frustration from certain people that have a bias against the free market. You are incentiveized to invent problems that don't exist.

So people are less healthy. That's not a cost of McDonald's business. That is a cost of the customers *chosen behavior*. And they are choosing it. So the cost has already been ""internalized"". The customer *accepts* the impact of their diet, even if it may be ignorantly.

Of course, part of the reason you believe in externalities is because you believe it is ultimately ""societies"" responsibility to take care of people. But it isn't. The health of the McDonald's customer is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. If you would not insist on involving government in health care, either directly or through mandates to provide care, then there would be no public cost from someone's bad health.

&gt; It's very depressing and I bet the people there would not drink soda had they known it would cause them to be have to be hooked up to a machine for 2 hours a day

Don't be disingenuous. People act recklessly all the time in all aspects of life. How many unexpected parents didn't know that sex can result in pregnancy? Essentially none. Yet they had sex.

Do you know why people drink soda? Because they enjoy it. And the risk is abstract and in the future. That's HUMAN NATURE.

So what's your point? Do you want to regulate diet? If you say no then you should just back off and stop pretending that other people's health is any of your business.

If you DO want to regulate diet then you are an irredeemable would-be tyrant.

&gt;If people went to the store and had to pay the UPFRONT price of a good, they would recoil at a soda and get a coffee or tea.

The reason there is no ""up front cost"" is because the future isn't known. It is impossible to know what will result or what the costs will ultimately be.

""externalities"" are a LIE. I know I'm wasting my breath but it would be great if you could reconsider this rhetoric you are parroting.

*I* and I alone am responsible for my health. I accept the risks and the future costs. They aren't McDonald's responsibility nor any other part of society.

You invent obligations where none exist and use those fictional obligation to excuse manipulation and regulation. YOU are corrupt.",1583575971,fjqohgt

Sadly,. these kinds of scenarios are somewhat predictable in that:

* each unique person wants other people to support the thing THEY want (or that THEY use)

* But in the end,. nobody wants to pay for it **ALL**.

Or put a different way,. each individual has to be OK with Taxes being raised (quite a bit) to pay for all the other things OTHER People want. That's a hard argument to sell. 

That attitude of ""Well.. I don't use X,. so why should I vote to increase taxes for X ?""..

So government workers who are experts in interagency collaboration, budgeting and planning should be near the people they need to collaborate with, maybe center for federal government?

Obama's BLM director disagrees with this move:

&gt;Bob Abbey agrees. He headed the agency from 2009 to 2012 and spent more than 30 years there, most of it out of Washington.  
&gt;  
&gt;He  thinks BLM will lose relevance “by not having a presence within D.C.  where you can have routine interactions with the Secretary of Interior,  with agencies like EPA, having that communications and consultations  with members of Congress and staff.”

As for whether the disease is serious, I think you are right, the disease will not be a huge issue, or should not be. But the healthcare system I think cannot handle the number of sick people about to hit it. The healthcare system too will lose a lot of nurses and Dr.s to this disease because it is so infectious.

You can check your smug attitude at the door, considering you can't even follow along with what we're even talking about here.

&gt;Say congress passes a law establishing an entity like FEMA.

We're not talking about establishing an entity. The whole topic of this post and our conversation is a bill that establishes the appropriation of funding for an entity that has existed since the sixties. The establishment of the LWCF did not REQUIRE much funding at all, that's why the president was about to slash it. What it did do is ALLOW funding. The current bill in question REQUIRES certain funding and directs how that finding gets distributed. 

&gt;They still have to appropriate funding for it in each budget. The President still has to appoint leaders.

&gt;It is possible to hamstring a government agency by purposefully defunding and understaffing it.

So are you going to share with me the bills that require specific funding that were not followed? Because all I see are media articles...

Sometimes its due to a temperature inversion (where warm air is *above* cold air rather than the typical opposite) but not always: sometimes its just a layer of cloud that only extends so far up. If you get lucky and that layer of cloud stops just below your location on the mountain, you get this classic ""sea of clouds"" effect.

Really there's no magic weather situation that you can look for that gets it to happen, you really need to have a good knowledge of meteorology to predict this kind of thing for a particular location.

Ran into this in New Zealand a lot with the sea breeze. Was really cool because in the summer you could get temps in the 50s F at lower elevations, then move up maybe 500-1000 feet and suddenly the temp is like 65-70 degrees. Then you also get the see of clouds.

The mesas above don't get as cold and stay above the dew point and/or get sun before the valley floor, so the fog either doesn't form up high or burns off faster than the lower elevation.

How many other places that are not closed pose far greater risk? Buy anything from the meat counter lately? Buy fresh veggies or fruit that someone else has picked over or coughed on? Set your reusable grocery bags in your basket or on the checkout conveyor (then take them home and set them on your counter)? How about public transportation where you are crammed in for extended amounts of time so close you can tell what your fellow passengers ate for lunch. If your resort is a cesspool that should have been fixed regardless of any public health emergency. This just appears to reflect off the wall panic and a lack of common sense",1584288856,fkkoxpu

&gt; The Great Depression caused the Sunnyside to suspend work in 1930 and it remained closed until 1937. That year, the Sunnyside Mining &amp; Milling Company was Colorado’s largest gold producer. But, the accessible ore reserves were almost gone and in 1939, the company laid off the workforce and closed the mine.

&gt; 
The Sunnyside Mill continued to operate until 1941. The railroad removed its tracks in 1942 and the post office closed the same year. The mill facilities were sold for scrap in 1948. By this time, the town was abandoned and comprised of empty buildings

10854,10854,beniciodeltrollo,"There are far more trees than before. The reason is pretty simple, white settlers were arborists. It's not a secret or mystery, either. 

My family came to the Western Slope in the 1870s and brought irrigation to the area. They initially settled west of Ouray on land that was not open to white settlers by the government, so they traded 50 head of horse for several years in exchange for land deemed to be wasteland by the Utes. The deal was a good one for the Utes of the region since they had a lot of wasteland and wanted to trade for goods. Relations between whites and the Utes were good until the government illegally negated their treaty and forced them into Utah and reservations in the southwest corner of the state. In any case, my family simply built a small pump to the Uncompahgre that brought water up onto the desert mesa above the river. The river was considered dirty and useless by the Utes due to the amount of silt (the name literally means ""dirty water"" in Ute). The land wasn't amazing, but workable after irrigation was brought. 

Other techniques were used by white settlers, like sewing alkali covered land—[that white stuff you see on a lot of desert soil](https://www.alamy.com/white-alkali-soil-at-the-edge-of-the-bistide-na-zin-wilderness-near-image153370393.html?pv=1&amp;stamp=2&amp;imageid=F9265657-4CC7-4F87-9E10-8594CBB331DE&amp;p=178375&amp;n=0&amp;orientation=0&amp;pn=1&amp;searchtype=0&amp;IsFromSearch=1&amp;srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dalkali%2520soil%26qt_raw%3dalkali%2520soil%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d)—with fruit rinds like lemon or orange peels to balance the ph of the soil. These days there are no shortage of options to add acidity. White settlers also created canals for diverting water to places that had none, this does a lot to change landscape for obvious reason. They also did small things like bring trees and plants that would reinforce the sides of rivers to prevent washout and help the river maintain a course—this helped mitigate some flooding and destruction of property in many communities. These days we have a problem with Russian olives and tamarisk as a result of those decisions in past decades.

Once cities were planned and built, shade was a necessity, so trees were used as windbreaks on farmland (you still see these today) and shade for animals and people. The reason we see more trees in higher elevations is due to less harsh winters. Due to global warming the winters are a little more mild at high evelations, meaning less trees are killed off. The winters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries seemed to have been quite a bit harsher in general than we have today. We also have more means of putting out forest fires than when people originally arrived, this allows forests to persist longer than they once did.

I understand that there’s a Colorado Covid-19 specific Sunday but there are only 3,000 users there compared to 100,000+ here. This stickied post has a mere 30 upvotes so it seems completely obvious to me that it is being overlooked or underutilized by the vast majority of users.

I love beautiful pictures of our state as much as anyone but this is a time to look out for humanity as much as we all want to look out for nature. The three or four amateur photographer quality photos posted here daily aren’t worth shutting out the reality of what else is going on in the world right now.

By allowing Covid-19 info to be shared here, alongside the other normal posts, we can encourage the spread of information that has the potential to help “lower the curve” and to potentially save lives.

The virus needs to be within 6 feet to transmit by air, and if proper health codes are being followed this would make it unlikely for it to transmit within a restaurant (assuming the workers are not sick, but that affects carry-out too)

They also could have just not closed the restaurants, in doing so more people are forced to get food from fewer sources (super markets) causing the exact type of congregation that they are trying to prevent.

In my other comments I was not trying to defend the republican response either, in fact I think they screwed up.  

In the discussion about economics I just suggested that factors beyond who is in office are the primary driving factors for the economy, which, so long as you don’t limit your analysis to only 3 or 4 presidents, is pretty hard to miss.  ( I did see people trying to post links to more data, which is much appreciated! Unfortunately I think the sub was taking them down? I’m guessing there is a rule against links.)

I have also pointed out that, by the numbers, corona virus is not significantly worse than the normal flu, and also gotten downvoted for it. 

Talking about a virus and the statistical numbers around it should not be a partisan issue.

This kind of partisan reactionary is why the country is so divided.  The attitude of “they don’t agree with me so they must be incompetent evil people!”  (Yes, I’m exaggerating the response slightly to make my point, you can look through this thread to see the responses yourself) is only deepening that divide.  If you’re wondering how Trump got elected, this divide is exactly how.  If you agree with Clinton’s use of the word “deplorable” you are a part of the problem, not the solution.  The first step to turning this country around is having enough self awareness to realize that you don’t know everything, and neither do I, and with very few exceptions, I highly doubt any of us are qualified experts on economics.  Guess what though, even the experts disagree with each other on a lot of these economic points.  Try to have an open mind some, even if your mind isn’t changed by the discussion, learning to see things from the perspective of someone you disagree with is a good thing.  

If we spend less energy hating those who disagree with us, and more time trying to understand the other view point, maybe, just maybe, we can turn this country around.",1584454228,fkqs18s

One question that always needs to be asked though, are these numbers because the states democrat run, or are the democrats elected because of these numbers?  It’s well established that higher income people trend towards blue.

On the higher median income, Democrat run states also have dramatically higher costs of living, so it’s not a direct comparison on income.  (E.g. 100k a year goes a lot farther in Kansas than California).  

On the recession comment, most analysts consider that a fluke of timing rather than a result of policy, which would actually be in favor of my point being that the economy is primarily driven off factors other than who is in office (not trying to say the sitting president doesn’t have an affect on it, just that it is mostly driven by other factors)",1584455317,fkqtpfg

The vast majority of cases of covid-19 will have mild symptoms akin to a cold, some will have no symptoms at all.  Those at risk are the elderly, and medical workers (granted, increased exposure for medical workers does seem to increase mortality rate in those circumstances)

**Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site.** If they are doing tours, this is a pretty cool reconstructed [St. Vrain Company fort](https://www.nps.gov/beol/index.htm) near Las Animas.  

**Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site.** Take the opportunity to learn about [a horrific event that changed the history of our country](https://www.nps.gov/sand/index.htm)

**Comanche National Grassland.** In extreme southern Colorado, this grassland is 435,000 acres with a lot of dispersed camping options, including along [Arch Rock Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/psicc/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=32254&amp;actid=62). There are also two amazing geologic sites in the area. One is [Picketwire Canyonlands Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/destination/picket-wire-trail) where you can see North America’s largest assemblage of fossilized dinosaur tracks. The other is [Picture Canyon](https://www.colorado.com/canyons/picture-canyon) an amazing area with 12,000 year old petroglyphs and Crack Cave Equinox site where the sun rays line up with ancient petroglyphs on the rock wall each solar equinox.  

There are also lots of opportunities for **hunting, fishing, camping, and water sports** at [John Martin Reservoir State Park](https://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/JohnMartinReservoir) and the [Great Plains Reservoirs](http://neenoshe.lakesonline.com) including NeeNoshe, Neesopah, Neegronda, Neeskah, and Queen.  

Also, there is a **hidden gem** on the road from Lamar to Springfield: [Two Buttes Reservoir](https://cpw.state.co.us/swa/Two%20Buttes%20Reservoir%20SWA). An extinct double-volcano rising up out of the plains with camping, hunting, water sports, and [The Black Hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUGBXwW5AZ4) one of the best jumping holes you'll ever see.  


These are all mostly in southeastern Colorado because I know it the most. Two sites in **Northern Colorado** that I know about: one is the OP, [Pawnee Buttes in Pawnee National Grassland](https://www.coloradodirectory.com/maps/pawnee.html) That is part of the Pawnee Pioneer Trail Scenic Byway.

There's tons of addresses that are outside city jurisdictions but still have the same city and zip code.  Think unincorporated locations.

For example in Boulder County there are a lot of addresses that are in unincorporated areas but still have a Boulder address and zip code. If you look up the tax rate for that address, it sees Boulder in the address and just gives you the rates for Boulder City + County + special districts instead of just giving you the Boulder County + special district rates.

Here are some long-term risks:


* **Viral latency:** The VZV virus is widely known for causing chickenpox in our early years, for example, and generally goes dormant for most of our lives and can then reactivate in old age and cause shingles. (VZV remains in our spinal cord cells for life.)  What will SARS-CoV-2 virus do to our bodies years or decades from now? We don't know.


* **Cancer:** Viruses can cause cancer later in life, long after you've been ""cured"" of the initial disease/infection caused by the virus.


* **Immune system:** Viruses influence our immune response to other viruses down the road. This is often a good thing, a silver lining. H1N1 exposure in childhood generally leads to enhanced resistance to H1N1 exposure later in life, for instance, and the same goes for H3N2 and so on. But you can't be sure all immunological consequences will be beneficial. Somebody infected with HIV tends to have an exaggerated immune response to most other viruses. How will the immune systems of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 behave down the road?We don't know.


A single drop of your blood can show nearly every virus you have ever been exposed to in your lifetime, but we know very little about the long-term ramifications of even very well-known viruses that have been studied for decades. Can any of them cause complex chronic conditions that fly under the radar? Are any associated with reduced longevity, decline in IQ, an increased incidence of cardiovascular events, and so on? We have more questions than answers.


There's no way anybody should willingly get infected by SARS-CoV-2, especially young people who have their whole lives ahead of them. On the contrary, it would be prudent to do everything possible to avoid it.",1584680508,fkzu7q3

I daily drive a piece of shit 97 tj. I keep the top off from April to November, but it's a soft top so it's easily thrown back up in case of emergency. It's big enough for my needs, including taking it to work, taking it on camping/fishing trips, actually reliable because i didnt got everything out doing bubba lifts and shitty spot welding. Theres no electronics that can be fried, and theres no carpet to get mildew. Theres holes in the bottom for it to drain out, theres tiedowns for the cargo net to keep things from blowing out, the speakers and head unit are marine grade, and everything is sealed.

You dont buy a jeep to be comfortable get good milage, have cargo space, go fast etc. Its pretty much a street legal go kart and that's what the fun of it is. It's one of the few Americanana Classic vehicles out there (your opinion on the newer ones but cant deny the 2006 back) that draw people to it. If (when) something breaks, it's designed to be as simple as possible to fix, or at least get it home. You can pretty much take the jeep apart with a toolkit that fits in your glove box if you really wanted to. 

Ypu can customize it however you want, for whatever purpose you need for it. Pavement princess to show off at the mall? Sure. Competition crawler that still spits out Hells Revenge on a bad weather day? Go for it. Theres always a market and availability for jeep parts, and that brings the community with it.

I dont care if I cant go over 70mph. I dont care if I cant move an apartment in one load. I dont care if I have to fill up my tank twice a week. If I needed any of that, il just park it and take my other vehicle instead.

I've been that guy digging leaves and stuff out of my vents because a heavy wind blew the tree I parked under naked. I've been the guy shoveling snow out because I forgot to check the weather that night. I've been the guy that had to pull over to get my rain poncho out of the center console on a road trip. I've had plenty of stuff stolen from it by shitheads that see it as an easy target, and quickly learned that locks are useless when it cost $600 to replace a cut open top/window for someone to steal your broken fm bluetooth transmitter.

It's like judging people who ride a motorcycle because they dont drive a utility van instead. It fits their lifestyle better, and it's an enjoyable experience that's worth the tradeoff. I dont care about the vibration on a bumpy road, but my wife loves the comfort of airbag suspension and soundproof cabin in her car so never rides in the jeep unless were offroading and is expecting a rough ride anyway.",1584686001,fkzzw3t

He kind if vaguely said that non essential businesses should abide by the 10 person gathering cap but he in no way shut them down, so, for the record, he is not on the list of governors that have shut non essential businesses down at all, he just shut down bars, seating service in restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, and ski resorts. Meanwhile he leaves the public parks open and unguarded so families can all flock to them on the weekend.  It's bad enough that he is so hesitant to do what needs to be done (full lockdown, citations for being anywhere other than home, the grocery store, or the doctors, or on the way to any of those places without an essential worker permit, with worker relief and food plans rolling out that aren't relying on the feds etc) but it is truly spineless to be waiting for Trump to do the right thing.",1584950029,fl9cxbr

Sort of true...  it depends on the resort. Loveland and A-bay are private property. Eldora's base and like half the runs are private property. So, you can't always do it.

EDIT: also, with USFS support, these resorts have the right to close uphill traffic. Just like in any national forest there are areas that can be closed due to safety concerns. Right now all Vail resorts are closed to uphill due to lack of avalanche control. There is no ski patrol and no risk mitigation at all.

There's no way to inspect a watercraft for aquatic nuisance species and maintain a 6ft distance from the boat owner (I've been inspecting boats for 6 years now). Even if we ask the inspectors to wear disposable gloves (one per inspection) they're still close to boaters, and not to mention boating isn't something you can do and keep a social distance...most boats aren't even 6"" wide...

Does anyone else think this is kind of insane?

I feel like boating is going to become a magnet for folks- with no where to go and nothing to do they're going to go hang out at the state parks or go boating, and the boat inspectors (a lot of them are retired folks) are going to be put at a huge risk...

“When we have lots of folks coming up from the Front Range into the mountains, that flies in the face of everything we’re trying to accomplish”

Summit County, which has had nine confirmed cases of coronavirus, is urging non-resident recreationists to stay away while encouraging its residents to exercise outside.

“We’re doing everything we can to slow the spread of (the coronavirus), and when we have lots of folks coming up from the Front Range into the mountains, that flies in the face of everything we’re trying to accomplish,” said Julie Sutor, Summit County director of communications. “We don’t want people to come here. We heard from the governor that everyone in the state needs to be conducting social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and the longer we prolong the outbreak, the longer we will be suffering the health and economic impacts of the novel coronavirus.”

Sutor said she doesn’t have the numbers to indicate how many visitors recreated in Summit County over the weekend.

Summit County recognizes the value of its residents getting outdoor exercise, Sutor said, as both Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock have emphasized. But there are also reasons to recreate closer to home.

“Having people cross county lines and having the opportunity to spread the disease from one person to the next is exactly the opposite of what we need Coloradans to be doing right now,” Sutor said. “We are not discouraging Summit County residents from getting outside and exercising. It’s good for their physical health, it’s good for their mental health, and we know there are lots of Summit County residents who are doing that within county lines in a responsible way and maintaining appropriate social distancing. We think that is a great thing for them to be doing.”

All Colorado ski areas are closed by executive order of Gov. Polis, and Summit County’s four ski areas — Copper Mountain, Breckenridge, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin — have banned uphill skiing. The Loveland ski area in neighboring Clear Creek County had hundreds of uphill skiers over the weekend, parking on shoulders of U.S. 6.

“I haven’t seen this myself, but I have heard people describe what was happening at Loveland ski area as a conga line going up the hill,” Sutor said. “That is certainly not appropriate under the circumstances. All the ski areas in Colorado are closed down for the purpose of reducing the spread of coronavirus among individuals.”",1585184086,flijv3t

In my youth I made several skydives at the airport in Calhan. It had a dirt runway and was (probably still is) the highest elevated DZ in the US. It's about 1000 ft higher than Mile-Hi DZ in Longmont (elev 5000.) And you can really tell the difference in elevation on suuuuuper fast landing (thinner air = less resistance to slow down a canopy.) Also, the actual DZ was a 30ft diameter circle of pea gravel surrounded by low-lying brush, dotted with cactus. In other words, at Calhan you would never want to land with the plane and you must stick the landing, probably running.",1585330575,flo2tg9

You should be from a local area. If you aren't, you should not stop anywhere on your way to and from here. For gas. For snacks. To use the rest room. You should not touch any handrails or stations while there. Otherwise you could spread the virus 

Everyone here should be doing only very mild and safe routes. They should all be avalanche safety trained. Otherwise you risk needed medical attention or rescue when hospitals and first responders are already overburdened and it's only getting worse.

You should only be going to and from here with people you are already sheltering in place with. Otherwise you're in a car sharing confined air and might be spreading the virus in your local community.

Traveling short distances to enjoy nature while staying clean and distant from others and shared surfaces is great. Getting outdoors makes being trapped at home much more tolerable.

13310,13310,austinD93," For that guy saying he's not being a photographer. He fucking nailed it though with his response though!

To explain further on the topic

The longer your exposure is, the more light and detail you will be able to pick up. There are certain photography tools that allow you to get longer exposures for night skies, like a star tracker. I myself use a star tracker when I do my sky exposures. For example, the OP said his exposure was 20 seconds. Mine are traditionally 4 minutes. 

If you don't have a tracker, can still achieve amazing results with a static DSLR, wide-angle lens, and tripod. Use the NPF rule or Rule of 500 (Not the greatest in today's age, but good enough) to give you your max exposure length before you reach star trails. For example 500/24mm=20.8333 meaning my exposure can be at most 20 seconds. After 20 seconds I will start to get star trails. 

For best results without a tracker. Find your exposure length you can do for your certain lens. Then JACK your ISO up, don't be scared. If you shoot single exposures, I'd say be anywhere from 2500-5000 ISO.",1585434674,fls5boe

But I think you are making a wild assumption. The people that live in that area I have no quible with. However the people that are traveling from from Denver or any other non-local area I do have a problem with.

I also think the comparison you make is really a false equivalency. However to engage in that false equivalency for a moment, you should not be on a road trip either. That would be very stupid as well. The whole point of the situation right now is that you are supposed to be minimizing risk. Therefore it is imperative that you keep from doing tasks that could get you injured and thus taxing an already burdened medical system. Whether that be not skiing or not touching a handrail, the distinction matters very little. 

Finally, I agree that this crisis is an ""us"" situation. But as I see it any situation that has a reasonable likehood wasting our resources (for instance diverting medical care to medevac somebody who's broken their leg out in the middle of the nowhere while skiing) seems extraordinarily stupid.",1585436625,fls8ioi

I honestly had no idea about the boating this time of year. I know since your reply that the governor has now ordered everyone to stay home but it's almost like everyone has decided it's the perfect time to be out. 

You're so right about boating becoming a magnet for people because they think what a great idea to distance themselves. It's like what I've seen in the hills and ski resorts. Makes me wonder if it's true about how highly educated so many are in this state. 

Geez, I'm one of these people who doesn't panic or worry about most things. (Someone once broke into my house when I was home watching football, and it pissed me off, so I confronted the guy and made him empty his pockets and take off all his clothes and throw them outside before I let him leave. He was not going to be stealing any of my shit! As an example.) And even I have been making sure if I do have to go to the store I clean off the grocery cart and seems like I always need one. I clean it before shopping and after. I'd clean off the self check area if they had anything to clean it with handy. 

Not only do I not want to get this, I do not want to pass  it to anyone should I happen to be a carrier. I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt if it happened.

The reason they want people to stay home right now, even though, as you say, the virus will still be here, is to do as they call it: flatten the curve. Basically hoping to have anyone who does get this virus spaced in intervals that the hospitals and medical facilities can handle instead of having everyone get it at once and they run out of room and supplies like we've already been seeing. That's the reasoning behind this. I'd hate to be a doctor who has to decide who lives and who dies because you don't have enough ventilators for everyone",1585521138,flvcukb

The best part is I was actually doing well right up until about January and lost most of what I’ve been working for..

I think, maybe if you had walked up the pass, this photo might be that much better and this guy would have liked it more. Because “easy access” is laaame.

In all seriousness. OP, it doesn’t matter how “easy” it is to take a shot. What matters is the composition and having clear subjects... This is a picture of stars and mountains which are beautiful in and of themselves and can be appreciated as such. I don’t think this photo is great but it’s not because of the little effort that went in.

Great photography is comprised of well framed subjects and great composition. Learn to find one thing beautiful in a large landscape like this and work the rest of the image around accenting it and drawing it out!

14042,14042,Madness970,"Here is a good response from a Boulder City Councilman. 

&gt;Rent, Realities &amp; Relief By Bob Yates April 1, 2020 In addition to being April Fool’s Day, today is the day when the monthly rent is due for many residential and commercial tenants. For some, it’s no joke, with shuttered businesses and lost jobs making the payment of a month’s rent difficult or impossible. But help is available. First, I think it’s important to recognize that commercial and residential landlords find themselves in much the same predicament as their tenants. As many tenants have lost their source of income with which to pay rent, likewise losing rent from tenants means that many landlords will not have funds to pay their own bills, including mortgages, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance on the very properties they lease out. Just as we would not walk into Safeway or King Soopers and expect them to give us groceries for free, expecting landlords to pay their bills but not to collect rent simply moves the problem from one place to another. This is one of the reasons why Boulder and most communities have not tried to impose a “rent holiday” or to force landlords to completely forego rent. That would take us down a slippery slope, tempting governments to likewise interfere in other contractual relations between parties, such as the leasing of cars and equipment, debt obligations, and employment terms. The legal issues are legion.

Landlords would most likely work with people in need. Reach out to them. I can see deferred rent payments and late fee forgiveness, but don’t expect rent forgiveness.",1585796387,fm6kucr

How about cutting some slack for a month or two. My issue is one that’s been mentioned elsewhere. We expect people to have 6month or whatever nest egg for emergencies but after a week big companies are crying for a bailout because they can’t sustain? It’s just a big unfair shit show for all the hard working people that have lost their jobs. Feel our gov could do better. Let’s hope we get past this sooner than later or it’s going to get bad. I lived through the Los Angeles riots as a 12 year old kid and this is not something I’ll ever forget. We need to find a way and it has to start from the top.

The claim that a “…cure should never be worse than the problem” resonates with common sense. Upon inspection, however, the fallacy lurking within this argument is that no cure exists for COVID-19. That’s the real problem. We are months, perhaps more than a year, removed from a vaccination or drug regimen that will reliably protect us. We face Robert Frost’s choice: “Two roads diverged in the wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”

For much of human history we were born, and then on an unpredictable day, we contracted a fever and died. Without anti-biotics this pattern remained true well into the 20th century. It is confounding that, despite all the wonders of modern medicine, we find ourselves encountering a threat we believed confined to the footnotes of our history. While we no longer torch witches for cursing our communities with plagues, this insight has done little to temper the zeal of conspiracists searching out scapegoats. Our dilemma is simple. We can act to constrain the spread of the novel corona virus, thereby reducing the number of deaths, or accept a far larger ""die-off"" as a reasonable exchange for preserving a rollicking economy.

You may think this choice is an easy one. Respect life. Protect life. Apparently, this was not the case for 14 of Colorado’s 16 Republican state senators. They linked arms and dispatched a letter admonishing the governor for issuing a statewide stay-at-home order. They remain unpersuaded by Jared Polis’ reasoning that the lives of thousands of Coloradans are at stake. From the fringe right to the merely far right we have been hearing conservative bleating that shutting down the state’s economy merely to save lives is simply too high a price to pay.

Economic costs are protested as a problem far worse than the virus itself. A preposterous theory has advanced that an even larger number of victims will be lost to suicide and despair once families apprehend the losses in their 401-Ks. This is utter rubbish. In 2008 voters opted for an unproven, first-term black Democrat as their president over a Republican who argued the American economy was “fundamentally sound.” Stock market values had collapsed by nearly 70%. At the root of the discordant grumbling among conservatives lies the faith-based schism dividing our politics.

The Bill of Rights includes the admonition that, “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.” For the most part our courts have supported this provision, although there has always existed a rump caucus alleging religious freedoms were actually intended to include just Christian sects. As enlightenment skeptics, the Founding Fathers were far closer than we are today to three centuries of unremitting Christian slaughters across Europe. They were understandably apprehensive of the powder keg potential inherent to theological disputes.

Yet they failed to guard us against the emergence of a secular faith in the operation of markets as a divinely inspired expression of economic virtue. It is the bishops controlling the Church of the Market who appear most alarmed that the country emerging on the far side of a prolonged national down may challenge their liturgy. If our financial architecture is genuinely too fragile to survive several months, just how much of our devotion does it deserve?

American families regularly face similar disruptions following a cancer diagnosis, or the economic impacts of opioid addiction and divorce. Is there, perhaps, something fundamentally wrong when half our citizens cannot cover an unexpected $400 expense? Should we be questioning why our rootin’, tootin’ prosperity is judged so brittle by its own acolytes? And, finally, why is it that capitalism has to be bailed out by socialists every few decades?

The market priesthood encouraging us to flip on the lights and strike up the band appears determined to quash these conversations. It’s not as though the American economy has delivered an unremitting record of success. Rather, it has stumbled from one crisis to the next. Today it is health care that we find squirming beneath the microscope. Relying on public health providers to deliver a for-profit commodity, it is only natural that market magic has trimmed facilities, staff and supplies. There is no incentive to maintain surge capacity for hospital rooms, trained personnel or ventilators. As we are now discovering, at our considerable peril, they don’t and they won’t. Colorado’s health care system is earnings centered, rather than patient centered. That needs to change.

Barely a century ago it was not uncommon for foot blisters to become infected, triggering a sepsis cascade. Without amputation patients usually succumbed to blood poisoning. Amputation was a necessary cure. Disease alone rarely collapses a society so much as it reveals flaws that then finish the job. Few choices come without risk, but it is time to choose.

14125,14125,GhostsOfMen,"This is a textbook example of a straw man argument by Mr. Hudson.  In his very first mention of the letter he claims that State Republicans are

\&gt;bleating that shutting down the state’s economy merely to save lives is simply too high a price to pay

When, in fact, this is not why State Republicand admonished Governor Polis at all.  In the actual letter Republicans first confirmed their alignment with Polis' goals and their commitment to the State of Colorado

\&gt;Our intentions are the same. We want to ensure that Colorado beats the Coronavirus pandemic with efficiency and success and allow the most vulnerable of our population to receive the medical attention necessary to lower the mortality rate

But the letter continues to say that the *way* that Polis decision was reached and announced would ""\[sow\] discord and fear"" because Governor Polis did not consult with members from both parties in both chambers of the house before making his decision, nor did he inform state lawmakers prior too announcing the decision to shelter-in-place first on Facebook, and then at a press briefing.  

Mr. Hudson is cherry picking and distorting the letter Republicans sent to the Governor and making numerous immoral and incorrect accusations and conclusions.

1. Mr. Hudson is incorrectly claiming that Colorado Republicans ""remain unpersuaded by Jared Polis’ reasoning that the lives of thousands of Coloradans are at stake"" instead of addressing the *actual* content of the Republicans letter.
2. Mr. Hudson is immorally conflating the concern from Colorado Republicans with a ""fringe right"" demand that we keep the economy rolling regardless of the human cost.  This is a preposterous and intellectually dishonest association
3. Mr. Hudson is providing us with the same tired black and white option that we have heard repeated by fringe left mouthpieces that we can either accept a modest but recoverable downturn in the economy or, in true alarmist fashion, we must accept a ghastly loss of life.   This is a deliberate and despicable false choice.
4. Mr. Hudson is libeling anyone who doesn't agree with his leftist ideology by attacking them personally as a ""bishops controlling the Church of the Market"" who ""appear most alarmed that the country emerging on the far side of a prolonged national down may challenge their liturgy"".

This is a despicable opinion piece of partisan rehtoric by Mr. Hudson and I encourage everyone to write to [ColoradoPolitics.com](https://ColoradoPolitics.com) and let them know that we expect better of them.

While the federal CARES Act — the stimulus bill that was signed into law Friday — does provide eviction protection for some federally funded housing, the majority of people in the country are still on the hook for housing payments even as the economy shuts down. Some states, like New York, have suspended mortgage payments, and 27 states plus Washington DC have put moratoriums on evictions. **In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis has held off on any statewide order related to housing**, leaving the decision to local governments and courts. He has asked for a pause on evictions enforcement.

And, while you're busy punching down on the weakest Americans take a look at what your beloved banks did with that bailout money ""ten years ago"" and why we taxpayers (including my sick loved one and friends) had to bail them out in the first place.  HINT: Rampant fraud and corruption.

While you're punching down on your fellow Americans online from the comfort of your home here's a little project for you (unless you're too lazy to do so) to educate yourself if you even care to do so at all:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)

It may still be on Netflix or available for online rental if you're so inclined to watch it.  It's a comedy so hopefully it'll cheer you up and give you even more energy to punch down on the powerless and bootlick the powerful banks.

Otherwise you can start here:

&gt;I'm a hard working person

Congrats, I’m sure you're the greatest person you know.

I worked at the headquarters of a bank as we launched Capital One — and I've had other jobs throughout my life.  If you consider a bank job ""hard work"" you're obviously a stranger to actual hard work.  Good for you.",1585853684,fm8pmrd

It's easier to just say that these are jobs Americans dont want to do (because they'd have to work for sub minimum wage).",1585853945,fm8q517

14161,14161,Cowicide,"&gt; No one is saying rent payments can’t be deferred. 

Polis hasn't done that. He's merely politely asked landlords to defer without any teeth behind it.  And many landlords  have mortgages and other expenses to pay or they'll lose their properties to the banks.

https://www.cpr.org/2020/04/01/colorado-coronavirus-rent-evictions-and-landlords/

"" ... While the federal CARES Act — the stimulus bill that was signed into law Friday — does provide eviction protection for some federally funded housing, the majority of people in the country are still on the hook for housing payments even as the economy shuts down. Some states, like New York, have suspended mortgage payments, and 27 states plus Washington DC have put moratoriums on evictions. In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis has held off on any statewide order related to housing, leaving the decision to local governments and courts. He has asked for a pause on evictions enforcement. ....""

And a pause in evictions enforement will merely have landlords taking matters into their own hands.",1585854625,fm8rfmt
14162,14162,Ausername1010,I don’t disagree with you. I’m just against the anti-landlord sentiment that’s being thrown around currently. Both sides need to be made whole.,1585854669,fm8rin1

14164,14164,Cowicide,"Well, it should be clear that I'm not anti-landlord by the fact I think mortgages should be forgiven.  I'm no fan of large banks holding most of the mortgages however.  We Americans paid for their bailouts (due to their fraud &amp; corruption) and they simply wasted it like the corrupt cretins they are.  If they'd used our bailout money appropriately they'd be prepared today for putting holds and forgiveness on mortgages, but they didn't.

If you haven't seen this film, it should be requirement for every American right now.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)

I think it may still be on Netflix and/or other streaming services.  It's based upon actual facts on the ground and a very excellent film.

Leadville is definitely experiencing everything you listed. You might say I'm part of the problem. I've lived in the mountains for 5 years now, hopping between the Vail area, Summit, then landing here when I wanted to buy a house. My work is Breck-based but the obvious choice was to buy here. My house is a flip. My neighbors told me it was empty, likely abandoned, in pretty bad shape before the flipper guy came and bought it and, well, flipped it for a profit. But I mean, my house is for me, not Texans on spring break. My other neighboring house is a VRBO.

There are a lot of Summit &amp; Eagle County people here who got priced out of where we used to live. Unfortunately, some people here are finding it difficult too because of rising prices.

There are a lot of really cute Victorian houses in this town that don't have permanent residents - they're short-term rentals for skiers, runners, etc etc. To say that it's lowering inventory and raising prices is a fact.

On the other hand, we need those tourists and there needs to be a balance. The local governments have been trying to put more diversity in the economy because they want to be more than just an Eagle-Summit bedroom community that happens to have a mine too. Case in point: my job.

Some people want Leadville to be shitty. They hate the tourists, the racers, you name it. You won't believe some of the old-timers here. They want their methy, poor town back. It boggles my mind. Honestly, I say fuck 'em. Leadville is a cool town and the local governments are rightfully capitalizing on that. There is a TON of infrastructure here that is old, decrepit. There's finally money coming in to fix it. Leadville is on its upswing, it wasn't destined to be a shitty place. It started out with glory and it's back on that track.

Immigration...yeah, there are a lot of undocumented people here. They also can't afford to live in the resort communities where they work, and they work hard. A lot of them live in the trailer parks surrounding town. Some of them own their mobile homes, a good sign of some progress. But when you walk down Harrison, it doesn't feel like Leadville is the diverse place it is. I'm sure a lot of these people are busy and scared. Most of the Hispanic &amp; Latino people here are citizens by the way. There isn't much of a problem with the undocumented people other than that they are stuck in a cycle of poverty and we wish it could be better, which is a sentiment I feel is very common around town.

Nucla, Naturita, Bedrock, and Paradox is known as the West End, as in the west end of Montrose County.  Norwood is in San Miguel County but is a sister-like community to the West End.

Not even the spanish flu came close to that.  Our unemployment offices are far more overrun than any hospital in Colorado. Food banks are almost depleted.  What do you think is going to happen when thousands of people become desperate enough. I know what I would do in that scenario and I promise you that you will have better chances surviving with covid then you will dealing with me looking to feed my family. They might have been with Jared before he shut the economy down. But not so much now. There is a point of no return and we are approaching that time very fast with the whole state shutdown. This isn't going to go away any time soon. What is going to end up happening is we will have a devastated economy and still people dying from this. Yeah it sucks but take that up with China.

China downplayed the disease for a long while allowing it spread amongst people fast. Not everyone there wears masks 24/78 especailly when they arent aware of the severity of the disease. Not to mention how crowded some cities are over there.

14701,14701,warau_meow,"“ Colorado has an abundance of cold &amp; dry air with a large population for the mid-west. New research just showed COVID-19 can remain stationary in enclosed cold &amp; dry environments like grocery stores for hours.
Even with quarantine &amp; social distancing. Colorado will continue to grow in cases &amp; deaths. Grocery store trips are dangerous, as you can be walking into someone’s particles who was standing where you are 1 hour ago. Face masks and goggles are definitely recommended.
Colorado’s going to become the epicenter of the mid-west. We’re a purple state, even though we came out big for Bernie in the primaries &amp; voted Obama. Our local government has been very confrontational to Trump, even though the Republican minority our here is only by a small margin. We also lack the financial capital to outbid wealthier states like California &amp; New York. Oh, and Apperently the Federal Government as well... Trump will not want to give us federal aid since we’re an “enemy state” to his presidency.
Colorado is on its own. Stay safe my fellow 303’ers.”

Colorado is definitely more blue than red, but not by that much.  The State Senate is only 54% Democrat and the State House is 63%, which shows how recent of a trend this is.  Is it permanent, or just part of the normal swings between parties?

Compare that to a solidly blue state like California, where the Senate is 73% Democrat and the House 78%, and it's been that way for basically 50 years or more.  89% is their federal representatives are Democrat.

Right now, Colorado is in a position where Democrats have a majority in all major bodies at the federal and state level, which gives them a lot of power.  But for the most part it's just a slim majority.

 As of March29th , 2,829 Covid-19 cases had been recorded in the Czech Republic, resulting in 16 deaths, with 40,700 tests having been conducted   
as of one week later  **4,475** total cases with 62 deaths. 80.304

So please tell me more about how it is ""efective"". Or could it be that the government of the Czech republic is giving their public false hope to get them back out and keep the economy going and they could care less if their people die. Especially when liberals around the world like Polis are pushing the fake news that cloth masks will prevent this. Now If Jared polis really thinks these masks will stop the spread as much as he claims. Then why doesn't he lift the state wide shutdown he imposed. the same shutdown that has actually overun our unemployment office.  I will gladly go along with this cloth mask BS if it means we can prevent mass poverty which will end up killing more then covid ever will. Next time do like I did and take a look at what is being done in the country that spread the virus in the first place.

14885,14885,Cowicide,"Sound like you don't understand how debt works.

Many tend to conflate government deficits with the national debt. The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all the money that was spent by government but not taxed back.

When the government spends more than it collects in the form of taxes (and other payments) it's labeled as ""deficit spending"". But that's only part of the story. To complete the picture, suppose the government spends $100 into the economy but only taxes $90 back out. The result is a surplus equal to $10 that shows up somewhere in the non-government part of the economy.

In other words, the government's ""red ink"" becomes our ""black ink."" Their deficits are our financial surpluses. So where does the ""debt"" come into play? Whenever the government runs a deficit, it sells government bonds called U.S. Treasuries.

This is usually referred to as ""borrowing,"" but that's misleading. What's really happening is the government is allowing people to trade in their dollars for a bond that pays some interest. A pretty good deal if you happen to be lucky enough to hold some of that $23 trillion.

Inflation is the relevant risk, not the size of the annual deficit. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, budget deficits rose to more than 10 percent of GDP. They were big, by historic standards, but they were nothing to worry about. In fact, most economists seem to agree that bigger (and better targeted) deficits would have helped the economy recover much more quickly.

The problem with the deficits we're running today is not their size, but their nature. A big part of the reason the government is running bigger deficits right now is because Republicans voted for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest Americans and large corporations. will only widen. The problem is the way these deficits are being used to funnel resources to the people who least need the help.

We can implement Medicare-for-All or make public colleges and universities tuition-free, even with the tax cuts in place. The debt is not the constraining factor (except, perhaps, politically). The point is this: the economic constraint is inflation.

The government should use the federal budgeting process to maintain a balanced economy. That means balancing the risks of inflation against the benefits of full employment. It means new spending programs only if those programs can be implemented without causing excessive inflation.

It may be necessary to raise taxes in order to prevent a massive infrastructure program from pushing the economy beyond its limit. But taxes aren't the only way to curb inflation. The most important thing is to understand what's actually driving the inflation. Historically, the big drivers of inflation have been: energy, housing, and health care.

So even if the political reality means you can't raise taxes, you can still fight inflation with policies that increase the supply of available housing units, promote energy efficiency, and lower health care costs. And, our political realities might evolve rather quickly with an MMT-informed Congress.

MMT provides a lens that can be used to understand how a modern, capitalist economy works. Based on that understanding, MMT also offers solutions which shows how fiscal/monetary/regulatory policies can be used to constrain inflation while maintaining full employment.

National debt is nothing to fear. What should scare Americans is allowing misinformation and fear-mongering about the national debt to prevent us from taking bold action to deal with the urgent threats.",1586129602,fmjg1tz

A T at the end of a word often just ends in a glottal stop, similar to in the phrase ""uh oh"", without releasing that air out of the mouth the way you do when you just say the letter T, almost swallowing the sound. I often had ESL students get confused by this, especially if they had originally learned English from British speakers. In particular, hearing the difference between ""can"" and ""can't"" was really hard for them, if the speaker wasn't aspirating the T clearly.


Another common example is that a T in between two vowels in American English tends to become more of a D sound. Think about the difference between how Americans say the word ""water"" or ""tutor"", and how most Brits pronounce it - retaining that crisp T sound.",1586380423,fmtwuc8

This was actually the first place I had ever successfully shot the Milky Way three years ago. But that happened down below where our campsite is in this picture. We found this awesome location the next day hiking and I told myself I had to come back to this spot and shoot here. I had an idea to have someone sit on this ledge of a 60 foot cliff and have the Milky Way rising above them with our campsite below. I took a couple pictures of my friends from this spot then I had to get in front of the camera as well. This is that shot of me!

Every year my friends and I go up to this spot in June to go white water rafting. We camp for three days and have loads of fun. I really hope we can do it again this year but with everything going on it’s hard to tell.

Chicago Basin is the most popular. During peak season it can be a bit crowded. If you’re not in Chicago or on the continental divide trail, you’ll be mostly alone. The Colorado Splits from the CDT and edges along the north side of the wilderness. That one is popular too.

Have a good map. I’ve done chicago to ruby lake, and there basically isn’t a trail for a good part of it. Be prepared for some pretty difficult terrain if you plan on climbing any of the 14ers or crossing over any of the passes.

There were storm that afternoon so I bailed down east trout trail(810),that trail didn't really exist below the saddle and I bushwhacked my way down til I was near the old mining area and there was enough of a double track to follow. Would not recommend unless you have to.  I took west trout trail(895) to reconnect but the trail was intermittent and disappeared in the meadow below the Cirque. I spent an hour zigzagging around trying to find some thing before I said fuck and just went straight uphill and luckily found a game trail through the cliffy stuff near the top. I don't think I was on the original trail but it was alright. I reconnected with the cdt and took it all the way to east Ute Creek trail 824 which I took Ute Creek trail and the trailhead. Both Ute Creek trails were very easy to follow and had little deadfall to deal with. It was 70 mi overall, but the detour was pretty stressful. It would have been much nicer to stay on the divide trail, but thunderstorms around there are common and can be dangerous. I was lucky there was a drainage I could drop into and meet back up with my route a day later but I wouldn't be confident in most trails below treeline unless I knew they were maintained.

Transmission within the wider community has already slowed to virtually nothing (in Colorado). The number of hospitalizations per day has dropped several days in a row. Since those new admits contracted the virus something like 2 weeks ago, new infections in the present day are even lower.

Seeing as how transmission really only happens from prolonged contact in a confined space, the chance of anyone in Clear Creek County catching the virus from some hiker (who again, has an increasingly insignificant chance of being an asymptomatic transmitter) is basically nonexistent.

Meanwhile, CCC is basically the Front Range anyway. It's less than an hour from downtown Denver, and its residents will be using Front Range hospitals. It's not some huge strain on their resources, because they share them anyway.

At the end of the day, this hurts the wider Front Range community by packing people into less and less options for recreation. And yet it does nothing to improve the situation for anyone.",1586535920,fn05qna

625,625,SkietEpee,"So let's unpack that. What gives a state the power to restrict ""non-essential travel"" especially given a claim of ""freedom of movement?"" Denver County's health order says its residents can't leave. Gunnison (and Routt and San Juan too ) says you can't come in unless you live there full time. Again, these are rationing orders that are temporary. If a state or county can restrict non essential travel, they can define ""non-essential"" however they please given the law and court precedent.

It's complicated to be sure. And all things being equal, it would be a lot cooler to shelter in place in Crested Butte than anywhere in Texas. But given that nothing is open except for grocery stores, liquor stores, and other nonfun general shops, it's a COVID-19 hotspot, and the health department is saying there aren't enough beds to go around as it is - it's not a great idea to go. 

Assuming it makes it to court, two things could happen. The courts affirm the power of the State and County Health Departments to make these kinds of rules given extraordinary circumstances, or they strike it down. In the second case there will be efforts (like in Routt) to classify non full time residential properties differently than full time homes so that they can make the same rules without running afoul of discrimination or due process issues.",1586539427,fn0ci77

It’s the home of Focus on the Family and the land of purity balls.  There is a heavy military presence, which leans more conservative as well.  Additionally as others noted it’s downtown core isn’t the best - it’s been awhile since I have been there though so maybe it’s changed - but it wasn’t a bustling, thriving downtown like in Denver or Boulder or Ft. Collins.  Manitou Springs is super cute and has a nice walking downtown area but it is also very touristy.

819,819,MountainMantologist,"I had a really cool experience in Ouray a couple years ago. I had just driven back down from the Mt Sneffels trailhead and was airing up my tires when I heard a really loud jet overhead. It was out of sight over the ridgeline by the time I looked up at it though. Then, a few minutes later, I heard it again! This time I started looking for it sooner and this F-16 shoots out from Red Mountain Pass flying south to north over town. I'm sure I'm a poor estimator of height but it looked to be 300-500' above town; it was certainly well, well below the height of the surrounding mountains. I was still a couple hundred feet above town airing up my tires and it wasn't eye level but it was so low as to look like it was landing. Anyway, it roared over town and then climbed sharply on the north end near the hot springs. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. 

[Here's an F-16 flyover in Telluride](https://youtu.be/AQNtN-yPMIw?t=39) \- this is the closest I can find to what I saw but the Ouray flyover looked even lower. When the jet starts to climb you can see how far below the surrounding peaks it was flying.",1586611566,fn332nu

854,854,SlowMolassas1,"People have different needs and expectations, so it depends what you're looking for.

It has the reputation of being very religious - but it's nothing like it was when I was growing up. There are still some large religious organizations, but they don't have the influence they used to. People are still very conservative, but generally have more of a ""live and let live"" attitude now.

There are 3 military bases plus the Air Force Academy, and some people don't like the influence of the military on the town. There are a few issues (shall we start yet *another* grass fire this week, Ft. Carson?), but I found all the actual service members to be friendly and pleasant for the most part (any group of people will have its outliers, but don't judge the whole group based on them).

The restaurant scene isn't the greatest compared to other places I've been. You won't find a lot of unusual international cuisine or anything like that. I've heard complaints about the bar scene, too, but that's not my thing so I have no personal experience with it.

Traffic is increasing, so anyone who has been there longer than a few years gets annoyed by that since they want to return to where it was. With or without traffic, the street layout sucks. There's a whole lot of ""you can't (easily) get there from here."" - Want to go from the west end to the airport? You have to weave around all over the place.

The hiking trails are great, but they can be really crowded. Some of the best you have to get to around sunrise or the parking lots will be filled. And there are often break-ins at the parking lots.

Housing prices skyrocketing, and rents following.

But there are a lot of positives, as well. The views, parks for walking/hiking all over the place, the weather (really, it is, yes you get cold days and snowy days, but it's rare to go more than 24 hours without sunshine, and there are usually at least a few days in January you can be comfortable out in shorts). Easy access to the mountains. So really only you know if the negatives outweigh the positives.

I've lived several places around the country (grew up near Colorado Springs, went to college in Boulder, lived in several cities in the midwest and east coast for a while, came back to Colorado Springs, and now live in a small mountain town). If I had to choose to move back to a city for some reason, Colorado Springs would still be towards the top of my list.",1586618721,fn3dw5m

&gt;This may have been a creative ranking, but we did it strictly by the numbers. In order to create this Big Deal List, we turned to business listings, social media, and the American Community Five-Year Survey (2009-2013) for information. First, we found the 100 largest cities in the nation, as we were just focusing on heavy hitters today. Then, we found data in the following all-important criteria:

**- Art supply stores per capita** (hmm, glass shops?)

- Music stores and instructors per capita

- Galleries per capita

- Art schools and programs per capita

- Book stores per capita

- Performing arts per capita

- **Colleges and universities per capita**

- **Facebook Likes for “arts and music” per capita**  😂😂😂😂

- Percentage of the working population in arts, entertainment, and **recreation**(!!! LOL)

&gt;We omitted any place that did not have data in any one of those criteria. From there, we ranked each place in each category from 1 to 100, with scores closer to one being more creative. Then, we averaged each place’s scores into one overall Big Deal Score. The place with the lowest number for that average became our most creative city, which is why San Francisco ended up with the crown.

I miss Sunday traffic in Utah ;)

I think our hiking is way better here once you are in the mountains, the Colorado Rockies are unbeatable, just the amount of wildlife and foliage. The Wasatch are more arid which some people like, I think they are beautiful to look at and ski in though. 

It used to take me 45 mins minimum to get to Skiing from sugarhouse. It takes me 1hr and 5 mins to get to skiing from cap hill minimum.

You are never really more than 30 mins from some really pretty nature and some awesome trails. Garden of the Gods is also a really beautiful place, but can get really crowded. Manitou Springs and Old Colorado City are cute little areas to walk around, but do have that touristy feel. The downtown area itself is shockingly small for how big the city is, but does have some good restaurants. One other thing I haven't seen mentioned here is Colorado Springs has a really bad homeless and heroine problem. Driving around you will see tent cities in the woods all over the place and there are lots of homeless people camping out in the park downtown. The only other city I have seen that bad of problem was in DC. Also, I would see needles all over the place in parking lots and see people shooting up in their cars, which you know is a little unsettling. I have never necessarily felt unsafe there, but did witness quite a few late night fights between some of the homeless population and they can be a bit aggressive when asking for money. I was also followed back to my car one time but a sketchy guy on a bike downtown... The city is also much more conservative than most places, mostly due to its very large military presence (Carson Army Base, Peterson AFB, Schriever AFB, Cheyenne Mountain complex, etc.) and military contractor activity. I worked for one of the contractors so I was exposed to it everyday and it definitely tends to be a much more right leaning crowd, which might be a plus for some.",1586639914,fn4et3c

Well something to  think about as we keep the city shut down. If we do this for too much  longer we will do irreparable damage to our economy. Poverty kills far  more then covid will ever kill. It also spreads faster. I personally  only know people that know people that have covid . But I directly know  at least 5 people that have lost their job due to the city shutdown.  Yeah it sucks Covid could kill as many as 2 million. But thanks to  poverty Every year, 6 million children die from malnutrition before  their 5th birthday. That's just the kids. This is what don't let the  cure be worse than the disease means.  Yeah it really sucks. But it is  going to end up being a choice we as a country will have to make. So  start washing your hands cover your mouth. Stop touching your face and  support those who need to stay inside because they are much higher at  risk. But we need to get back out there soon. Most experts say that even  if we do slow it down it will still come back in the fall. We  absolutely can not go that long. It is up to we the people to mitigate  the spread as much as possible so the hospitals don't get over run.  China currently own's 1.06 trillion in US debt. I say it needs to be  forgiven and trade deals that favor the US need to be setup. They owe  the entire world for this. Not Chinese people. The Chinese government  that allows wet markets.

The property is listed as owned by the United States of America, so this is federally owned land. The address listed is at the Denver Federal Center building 20. I didn't find much about who has offices in building 20 other than the FDA and the USGS, the latter being likely who manages the land.

It's just below what seems to be called Richie Gulch and Red Creek and as others said it looks like a pretty old oxbow (at least the outer/south edge of it). 

I think it was/is used for something to do with stormwater management by the USGS and might be related to the flood there in 1921 (which may have been the event that washed out the original river bend).",1586718976,fn7exj8

Seeing Roger Ebert present on a film. Amazing lectures. Drinking on the Hill. Taking part in 4/20 from Farrand Field. I worked at the Sink, I worked at Cosmos, I worked at the Med, and at the St. Julien. I partied hard, I made a ton of friends, and I value the education I got, both on paper and in life. I loved the hippy spirt. I didn't mind the Trustifarians. I realized that Boulder was a town that rich people wanted to live in and really only they could afford, but if you worked hard and could make it work, the quality of life was second to none.

While the two states may, increasingly, find areas of agreement on certain policies, particularly in relation to social issues, that is really where the similarities end. California's approach to governance is completely at odds with how Colorado is run. Colorado is structured to allow for local control with most power being vested in counties, cities (particularly those that are home-rule municipalities) and even local districts. California takes a very top-down approach where edicts are issued from Sacramento and the entirety of the state is mandated to comply.

In relation to business, regulations are typically tailored to remove barriers to entry in favor of open commerce and an overall lassiez-faire approach. For example, in relation to recreational marijuana dispensaries, virtually anyone who does not have a criminal record is free to open a dispensary within the state. There are no quotas on the number of licenses that may be issued as there are in many other states. While counties may ban dispensaries, such a ban would only apply to the unincorporated areas of the county while home-rule cities are free to make their own rules (e.g. Arapahoe County has a ban, but Aurora is filled with recreational dispensaries).

Issuing blanket orders to a multitude of insurance companies, irrespective of their current financial situations, is not something I would anticipate Polis doing. Allstate, Liberty Mutual and several others have already chosen to issue refunds to their customers and pressure from market competitors should naturally lead most others to follow suit.",1587008508,fnjwads

The teachers for studio were random picks who all had their own and different ideas of where we should be or what was a good or bad process.  It was like... wtf does everyone want?!? How can you be grading me like that on something so subjective.  It was insane.  

With the English department, their policy on “attendance.”  I had a M-W-F class for a semester where after 2 absences, the 3rd was a full letter grade down.  It was our “participation” score.  Bullshit.  Call it an attendance record.  I was the only one every day speaking and engaging while 80% of the class slept.  I had 5 missed classes and my B turned into a D.  I appealed to the teacher who was a TA who was useless.  The dean was just a huge prick too.  I was fulfilling a freshman year credit in my last semester and the D forced me to take the class again.  It was just so defeating.  

There’s more to it.  I work in the automotive service industry now.  I should have never gone to college.  I got a better education in highschool.  I was a 3.5GPA student and through that program I ended up depressed and feeling defeated and useless and there was no outlet.  I ended up just saying “fuck it” I’ll do what I want and make what I think it good, rather than continually try to appeal to these people with an aire about them.  I was done convincing people and started trying to just make what I felt was happy.

I fell in to depression and became lost in the big school.  Now I still struggle with the lost years but thank god I just forced myself through.  THAT taught me the real lesson.  No one, not even your peers are there to help you.  I thought it would be a cooperative and collaborative environment.  It was a toxic every man for himself environment.  I get that is what the real world is like, but that’s not what a positive learning environment should be.  

There’s so much more to it, and even my story above is choppy and doesn’t read well, but it’s a quick/long comment and I’m at work.  

Ultimately I was the naive “let’s work together and study and be in this learning environment where teachers know you and engage with you.”  What I got was a prima-Donna b list but they didn’t know they were b list, random and toxic design school.  I definitely didn’t start there, but I certainly ended there.  Best thing that happened to me was having to deal with, fight for, and figure everything out on my own.

Of the total staff in FDNYEMS, 25% are out sick with COVID, a higher rate than most physicians and nursing staff at hospitals. 

Because we first responders, we are really the first set of medically trained eyes on a situation. Docs rely on EMTs/Paramedics to tell them what's coming in through the doors. This means there are times we don't know what we are getting into, and how bad the situation is, until we get on scene. This means our exposure risks for infectious diseases are elevated during a pandemic.

Firefighters are forever linked with emergency medicine, nothing with change that. In Colorado it is very rare to find a Firefighter who isn't an EMT/EMR. It's mandatory for most people. So odds are if you need an ambulance in Colorado, you will come in contact with a firefighter. 

For me, my department runs the ambulances for our district, and nearly everyone on that ambulance is a firefighter. If not, they are in training to be. So when I firefighters, I mean firefighters/emts/paramedics. I apologize for any confusion.",1587082314,fnn1bjx

1779,1779,Katholikos,"&gt;If we took 10% of that revenue, put it towards healthcare (just for example), that would be 200 million a day to help those in need while the military would still receive 1.8 billion a day. 

This *sounds* easier than it is in practice. I was in the military, and I spent a lot of time working in a unit that was basically doing industrial engineering - in short: looking at processes and identifying ways to improve their efficiency.

Fun fact: even though our unit was funded by ""selling"" training to other units (robbing peter to pay paul here, but you get it), we often found the issue was a lack of resources - people, tools, facilities, etc.

If you take money away, we absolutely turn down our activity somewhere. So the question isn't ""do we take money away from the military"", it's ""what do we sacrifice for this money"". MANY of our members are already stretched to the max, so taking away from manning (the single greatest cost to the military) is difficult and relatively inefficient - they tried that running from the Cold War to 2010, when numbers were reduced from 600k members to 350k. Members were stretched thin, there was (is) a serious suicide problem in the military due in large part to horrendous morale as a result of this.

If we take away from the mission, what do we stop doing? Do we have fewer pilots ready to fly? Cheap now, but *massively* dangerous whenever the next war rolls around. I think you'd have to be crazy to think we'll never be in a war ever again, so *eventually* we'll pay the price for this.

What about fewer planes/tanks/etc.? Similar problems as above, though not as serious. The issue with this is that we now need to dispose of these vehicles, and getting replacements in case we need them is a NIGHTMARE. It's horrendously expensive, and the VERY few companies making jets will absolutely rip us raw on prices.

Pulling out of countries we're occupying is dangerous as well. It can quickly destabilize a region and lead to many innocent civilians being killed by their countrymen in the power vacuum. Granted, this is only really dangerous for non-Americans, but unless you think American lives are more valuable than others, this isn't really a great solution. It's a slow fix, meaning we won't see the money for decades at least.

IMO, our best bet is to invest a LOT of resources into making the military more efficient. Lots of things *could* be fixed, but nobody has the time or energy to fix what's broken. I agree we're spending more than necessary on our military, I just disagree that it's as simple as ""pay less lol"".

People act like the military is a huge money sink, but we enjoy an enormous number of benefits for it, and the world is much more politically stable because of it. There's a reason people joke about the US being the world police - we effectively are, and MANY benefit from it. Maybe we need to look inward, forcing everyone else to step up and take up their share of the work, but of course this weakens our position in lots of political situations.

I am a first responder, on the front lines with my brothers and sisters. We aren't 'tending to our own souls,' we are helping each other through this devastating pandemic that is stealing the lives of too many. Morale is key for mental health bud. Mental health is already tenuous in our field of emergency medicine, and this is pushing many over the edge. Sure we need PPE, sure we need wages, 100%, but what can some pilots do about that? Do you know how we get our pay and gear? As firefighters and EMTs, we get it from you, the voter, voting yes on our mill levys. Federal money doesn't support fire departments or ambulance services. When you vote no, we don't get jack shit.

Nobody benefits from a flyby? I'm sorry they don't rain down money and N95 masks at each fire station and hospital they pass. However we enjoy watching, it makes up happy to look up at cool jets and know that those pilots are grateful for what we do. Just like how we use our firetrucks at their airshows to show them our appreciation for what we do. 

Misappropriated dollars? The dollars were specifically appropriated for the USAF. If you would like to call your senator a year ago and tell them about his pandemic so they can kick a few mil to the CDC, go ahead and use your time machine. 

If you're mad and you want to do something, write a letter of thanks to your local hospital, local fire department, local ambulance crew. Tell them thank you, that you appreciate what they are doing. I keep every letter I get in my locker, so that every day I go on shift, I see the notes of people I serve and they remind me what I do is good, what I do is right.

Because the virus is highly contagious, we are required to make personal sacrifices to save the lives of our at risk family, friends, other Americans and people around the world.  Maybe it helps to look at it from the point of view that instead of jumping on a grenade thrown into a trench to save your brother you binge watch The Office for a sixth time instead. For those of us who are without work, we all want our jobs back.  Everyone wants to go back to normal life.  Unfortunately, this is a global pandemic.  We aren't turning to zombies and the death rate isn't exorbitant, but these things take time. If you aren't appropriately treating this pandemic like the crisis it is, I fully encourage you to start.  Colorado will re open one day and you will have a job again one day.

Much less than many other nations. People forget how large our economy really is. Further more, this is about 18% of our total government spending, coming in 3rd in to social safety nets and *current spending* on Medicaid and Medicare (34%, and 24% respectively). 

2. You cannot fund M4A off $650 billion annually. As I said, we already spend more on Medicare/Medicaid *currently*. Bernie, Warrren, Biden, etc all recognize M4A costs a trillions. Not that we couldn't afford it, I believe we absolutely can. Why do I say this? My masters degree (Economics) is focused on healthcare and macroeconomics.

In addition they will have even more control over what data you can and can’t see like in China, and I certainly don’t care to have their censorship problems here.

It was crazy and since  very few people actually drove that side road, it would get covered with snow too next it snowed. There were never any major accidents, but people got stuck, a lot. City sent out a backhoe and it was nuts to see how thick that ice got. Was like that every year lol. Springtime it would turn into its own little inland sea, as the surrounding ice and gutters were still too tall. The best is when the surface would freeze over.  Car would drive slowly over it thinking it's solid but slick, and just CRUNCH and scare the shit out of them. Meanwhile where we were on the street out front yard got sun all year and our gutter was slightly on a slope. Never ever had ice problems.
