Purchasing Recreational Cannabis in LA usually means giving the retailer personally identifiable information (Government ID) and letting the retailer match (and save) your purchase history to that personally identifiable information. Cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, so there would seem to be a lot of incentive for Cannabis consumers to have control over that data. The new CCPA went into effect on January 1. The CCPA contains language that should (in theory) enable consumers to have their personally identifiable information deleted:

\&gt; The bill would grant a consumer the right to request deletion of personal information and would require the business to delete upon receipt of a verified request, as specified.

It's TBD if the ""loopholes"" in the CCPA are big enough for Cannabis retailers to take advantage of. IMO, CA Cannabis consumers can (and should) expect control over their personally identifiable information.",LosAngeles,CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and Recreational Cannabis

Pre-1925 - The 9th Street Bridge can be seen mid-photo, spanning over a set of parallel railroad tracks, as multitudes of cars travel across. The Chamberlain Company Inc., located at 2550 E. Ninth Street is visible in the forefront, and manufacturing buildings can be seen in the background on both sides of the bridge. Clouds of smoke from several of these businesses make for a hazy view of the city.

1925 - Aerial view of Los Angeles River at Ninth Street

http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics17/00028255.jpg

1925 - A view of the 9th Street Bridge, or Viaduct, which spans over the Los Angeles River and multiple railroad tracks, from the yard of the St. Louis Fire Brick Co. at 2464 E. 9th St. A row of corrugated tin sheds, stacked pipes, barrels and other industrial equipment cover the yard around the manufacturing buildings. Men are walking across the bridge and cars are parked at its side. Over a year in construction, the bridge's total length is 1,870 ft.; the width is 70 ft., including 5 foot sidewalks on either side of the causeway. 

http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics48/00073835.jpg

1929 - Built in 1925 and originally titled the ""Ninth Street Bridge,"" the 1,422' long and 70' wide bridge was renamed in honor of the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. The sidewalk expansion joints were reconstructed in 1945; the railing was replaced in 1955, and restrainers were installed at the joints of approach spans in 1982. 

http://jpg2.lapl.org/pics24/00046720.jpg

1930 - The 9th Street Bridge spans over the Los Angeles River and multiple railroad tracks in this view. The Chamberlain Company Inc., located at 2550 E. Ninth Street is visible on the left, and manufacturing buildings can be seen throughout the background. The 1,422 foot bridge was built in 1925.

It almost feels like they've become ""frowned upon"" or unworthy of any restaurant/place we visit. There's infinite donuts, ice cream and trendy cafe options but no sight of pancakes.. Are we blind or whats up?

Also, if you have a rec please confirm that there's real maple syrup. I had some horrendous imitation close to insult at AOC.

Because you're coming from a boring ass part of the U.S. (clearly our city is better.) a sunset in L.A. clearly means you're superior to your friends back in the east coast who are freezing their asses off. I doubt anyone who grew up here even upvotes these things.

{pay: $60 for 4 hours (including travel pay)}

Hello all! Welcome to the our show, ""Religious Debates"", where we bring together a group of people, each of a different religion, in order to inform society of the beliefs and morals of different religions, and to also provide a platform for different religions to discuss and debate popular topics/questions that arise in everyday life.

Shooting will begin in late January 2020 (TBD). We are looking for 5 people of different religions (with the exception of 1 atheist), each passionate and willing to discuss/debate topics about their religion and everyday life. We are also looking for 1 host, with an exciting and extroverted personality, who will be responsible for reading off the list of questions to the cast and controlling the flow of conversation when needed/making sure everyone gets a chance to explain, discuss, and debate the current topic.

Rules/Regulation:

1.) All participants must sign a consent form allowing the use of the talkshow footage to be uploaded to a variety of social media platforms (i.e. Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, etc). In addition, the footage will be mass marketed once released, so the participants must be comfortable with the video being promoted to millions of viewers.
2.) All participants must be comfortable explaining and debating topics relating to their religion, and also supporting their views/morals by reading certain passages from their religion's religious text (if applicable).
3.) Video Shooting will be for 4 hours, with a 30 minute break the end of the second hour. All members will be required to return to their seats exactly when the break is over, in order to re-begin recording for the remaining two hours. Failure to return from break on time may result in a forfeit of the full 4-hour pay.
4.) All those who are chosen to participate will come one time for 4 hours to shoot. There will be shootings taking place 3-4 times a month, so those chosen to come back for another return alter in the month will receive a pay increase their next visit and a possible permanent spot on the show.

HOW TO ENTER TO PARTICIPATE:

1.) Send a 30 second - 1 minute video of yourself. In the video, tell us your name, age, where you're from, your religion, and why you are passionate about your religion. Explain why you think you would be a good member for the show. (EMAILS WITH NO VIDEO WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE)
2.) Those chosen will receive an email with information about location, show information, and other important details.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

-1 HOST (Age 20-35, caucasian, male or female; must be 100% unbiased towards any and all religions. This person's own religion/moral/personal beliefs will not and cannot be talked about/explained on video in order to keep things fair. )

-1 CHRISTIAN (any age/race/gender)
-1 MUSLIM (any age/race/gender)
-1 ATHEIST (any age/race/gender)
-1 JEHOVA'S WITNESS (any age/race/gender)
-1 MORMON (any age/race/gender)

(Other religions are welcomed, but these are priority)

I'm trying to get a CA license, but as you all know it requires a CA license holder to accompany you.

The problem is that my parents, who have a valid car and insurance do not hold a CA license. They have a license issued by a federal government, which apparently does not qualify as a CA license. 

Our network is extremely narrow, so we are having a hard time finding someone to accompany me. (How it has to be on weekdays during working hours...)

I have looked for services like YoGov and it says it would charge me $180-ish for the car and the driver, and I don't really need a car. My parents and I can drive to the DMV, so the person could just show up and hand in their license and wait for an hour until my test ends.

Does anybody know where I should look for someone to accompany me for the driving test?",LosAngeles,Any paid services to accompany DMV driving test?

He showed me the 'prices' right there on the boxes.  $3k for the proejctor. $5k for the surround sound system.  Then his pitch was buy the screen ($1200) and he'd give me the projector and surround system for free.  I told them I was good and didn't need it and started to walk away.  They followed me for a bit, offering lower prices, all the way down to $500.  Finally I got annoyed and told them I know this scam and then they sped off.

My friend was near this area and saw a kitten near the sidewalk, she went to call it to see if it had some sort of identification but it went under a car. She couldn‚Äôt see the kitten and heard meowing inside, I think the kitten was in a place where if the person drove the car it could harm it. My friend had to leave but when she returned she couldn‚Äôt hear meowing anymore. Shes worries the kitten might be in the car or even back in the sidewalk and is worried it might be hit by a car.

My fiancee and I are planning our end of April wedding, and we've gotten around to looking for a DJ. Neither of us have much of an idea on where to begin, so I figured Reddit would be a good place to start.

So I ask you: Does anyone know a good wedding DJ?

Some parameters:

* Our budget for the DJ is $1,000 and below;

* The only thing we know for sure is that we don't want someone too over the top/looking to be the center of attention. Another way of putting is that we're not so much looking for an MC, as we are someone who can keep the music going, read the room, and keep people dancing.

* Obviously we have certain ideas of what kind of music we would like played, but we imagine that most DJ's can work with us to figure that out (right?)

884,whodis_1993,1578676426,emtycp,Discussion,Walk out to my car this morning and couldn't leave since there was a car 2 inches from my back bumper and a truck 1 inch from my front bumper. When I do parallel parking on the street the first thing i do is check how much room each car in front of or behind me has to get out to reduce chances of damage. SO yea had to take a $30 uber to work as I had no other option. Why do people do this? Makes me wish I had a car i didn't care about so i could have rammed my way out of there lol,LosAngeles,Had to Uber to work because of cars blocking me in.

There were some points where I would see a Shell or a 76, then maybe a block away see an Arco, with the Arco selling gas at 20 - 50 cents cheaper than the other guys just right up the street.

1088,marlow6686,1578936385,eo77ei,Nan,"After our wedding in May 2020, my fianc√© and I are planning on a honeymoon in California. We‚Äôre planning to do a few days in LA (prob Santa‚Äôs Monica) then drive to Palm Springs where we will stay for a while before visiting Joshua Tree, San Diego then home. We are looking to set out on 25th May, the Monday after our wedding.

A honeymoon in California/LA probably sounds a bit rubbish to those who live there, but we (British) have been wanting to visit for a couple of years. 

We are also lucky to live close to more ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô or ‚Äòromantic‚Äô destinations such as Paris or Italy that we can visit cheaply for a long weekend, it‚Äôs not where we want to spend two or three weeks. 

I‚Äôll be sorting out an itinerary this week with a travel agent, but need a little travel advice.
My fianc√© is a big fan of baseball. There isn‚Äôt a big baseball presence in London, but I got him tickets to see his first game here at the London series last year (Yankees vs Red Sox).

He (randomly, in my opinion) supports the Cleveland Indians, who happen to be playing the Angels at Angel Stadium the day after we plan to arrive in LA. I‚Äôd love to get him tickets but want to see the best way to get there before we make firm plans.

I know it‚Äôs best to drive in LA, as public transport isn‚Äôt as popular as here. But is that true of going to the game? Is there a shuttle or subway or anything of the like that goes there and back? 

Also any general tourist tips are very welcome!",LosAngeles,LA/ California honeymoon- Baseball

I've been scouring r/LA trying to understand the economics and having some trouble understanding how much it costs to live. I have never been to LA but have heard the tales of insane costs of living but after doing research, I think Toronto may be as expensive or even more than LA which sounds insane!

Me: 80k income, age 28 School Debt:50k

Partner last year of nursing: Expected income of 60-80k

My apartment is in a brand new condo that is 680sqft with 1 + 1 in a nice area and its costs me 2100. Average 1bed price in toronto is like ~1800.

Condos in toronto start at ~500k for 500sqft. Actual homes go for 1 mil+

My monthly Average budget looks like:

Food: $600

Monthly Transit pass: $150

Debt: $700

Uber for a night out: $30

Average cocktail: $12

Average 750ml liquor: $26

Assuming we can find comparable jobs, would we really be suffering and living a below average life on a combined ~160k income in LA?

I'm looking to live in a 2 bedroom 2 bath place under $3600 (or so) in a non-loft style place.  I've narrowed my search down to a few in the Pershing Square area and a few in South Park.  

Pershing Square:  
Metro 417   
Trademark DTLA

South Park:  
Oakwood at Olympic and Olive  
Windsor buildings (1000 grand, Olympic, South Park)

Does anyone have any feedback on how those spots are from experience?  Any thoughts on  living in the Pershing Square area vs South Park?

&amp;#x200B;

I just flew into LAX for the first time in a long while. Haven't used the new pickup lot yet. So.. I exited Terminal 1 and opted to walk to the lot. I get there and I see all sorts of people and cars, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I load up the Uber app and the map zeros in on my location.. but it just shows the street address like any other location in the world. I'm confused because I figured there would be some interface or special menu... nope.

&amp;#x200B;

So I click confirm, and then it proceeds to find me a driver... and picks some random Uber driver that's 10 minutes / 2 miles away, nowhere near the lot. I think ""this is weird..."", but proceed to wait the whole 10 minutes for the driver to arrive. In the meantime I'm seeing people getting picked up through from cars in a queue in the lot around me. Anyway the Uber driver shows up in the lot, picks me up, also expresses confusion about the situation and can't exactly diagnose it, anyway nevertheless drives me home.

&amp;#x200B;

What did I do wrong? Was there some special step I was supposed to take? It literally just found me a regular Uber driver the same way it always used to. I was presented no special options or anything like that...",LosAngeles,Uber didn't work correctly at the new LAX setup. What did I do wrong?

1236,anonymousperson45,1579061326,eox6ay,Nan,"For any tourist or non local, West Los Angeles is not all of Los Angeles. As a local I consider Los Angeles to be Los Angeles County anywhere from the San Fernando Valley to Cerritos which borders Orange County (which used to be a part of Los Angeles before they succeeded due to high taxes, which I would also consider a  suburb).

Most residents in the LA area do not live within city boundaries. The safe parts are west LA west of the 405 and north of the 10 and also the 210 freeways avoiding areas such as: Carson, Inglewood,  Compton, South Gate, Lynwood, etc. 

Inland Empire is also within relative driving distance of Los Angeles if you are coming here to visit or live in. Many people commute from Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, etc into Los Angeles for their jobs or from Corona into Orange County.

I'm going to have people disagree with me but I consider ""Los Angeles"" also to be the surrounding counties in LA that are within a decent drive, obviously not San Diego or Santa Barbara.

If you want to come here and not sit through traffic, get an uber and have your hotel near all the hot spots. There's a hell of a lot more to Southern California than just west LA. I've lived in suburbia my entire life and never really set foot in the actual city of Los Angeles unless I'm visiting people or work sends me to their main office.

If you want to visit beaches-Santa Monica is not where you want to be to avoid crowds. Neither is Venice or Malibu.

If you want to eat like the locals, ask your friends and family that live there. In-N-Out is okay but there are far better places I know of personally that I go to and In-N-Out burger is only a decent option compared to the sit down burger joints and  the hole in the wall places are where you'll find the best food.

Stop relegating Los Angeles as only Beverly Hills, or Universal. 

Also: the Angels are not in Los Angeles, they are in Orange County (Anaheim). Disneyland is in Anaheim, and Knott's Berry farm is in Buena park (not in Los Angeles County). If your goal is to hit all the tourist spots you're going to need more time than a few days... Locals don't go to Disneyland all that much because it's overpriced or we go because we know someone who works there who can get us in for free on the non blackout days.",LosAngeles,An overview of Los Angeles

I'm a slightly broke chick that needs a not terrible haircut. I don't know where to begin looking because I've only been here for like threeish months. I want to maybe avoid a Fantastic Sams/Great Clips type place if its possible.

As if Good Day LA had a sub where people actually wanted to get something positive or productive out of the power of the internet.  

Who am I kidding let me drop some key words so people can argue about the same stuff again:  

- Moved to the most expensive city in the world, why isn't everything cheap?   
- Search tool? I deserve a personally tailored answer to this question that gets asked every single day.      
- A car did something I don't like, lets get angry about it together (picture taken while driving removed due to personal information).     
- Tried everything to deal with my neighbor except for actually talking to them, so I called the cops.    
- I never make an effort to interact with people in real life, why is it so hard to make friends in LA?  
- Everyone in LA is a horrible driver except for me. I can handle my liquor.      
- Something happened that happens all the time in a large city, validate my emotions as I catastrophize it.   
- Police exist in my city. What's going on?  
- Heard a loud boom that could literally be anything at all. What was it?  
- Someone blocked my bike lane, why don't we have better public transportation? If you aren't willing to bike from long beach to woodland hills youre a coward.     
- Why can't LA be more exactly like my home town?   
- I'm stressed out and do nothing to manage my road rage, upvote if you feel the same.  
- I decided to move to the most diverse city in the world and only associate with people that are the same race as me. Am I cultured yet?         
- I'm gullible enough to fall for a scam, so let me make it your problem by posting a phone number for you to harass.    
- Visiting LA, best place to see disney's immigrants on ice near the LAX? Non-resident troll accounts please comment.         
- Practicing my storytelling to become a Director, please read my fictional run-in with a homeless person. I swear it happened.     
- Someone took MY lime scooter from my front porch. I can't believe how selfish people in this city are! Sent from my iphone while letting my dog shit on someone's walkway at 2am.     

- I moved here for a job at a tech company. That means I'm better than you even though I brought nothing of cultural value with me except for my racial prejudices and outdated ideologies.    
- My neighbor does something annoying. Instead of talking to them like a functional adult, what indirect and petty forms of harm should I carry out against them?  
- I stare at minorities and homeless with a dirty look while treating them like non-humans, AITA?   
- LA shouldn't provide Mental health and affordable housing is a waste of money because there are certain people that don't use it.  
- I was the victim of a petty crime because I have no street smarts. Support me in this time of traumatically experiencing what poor people deal with all the time.   

   
- Here's a thread about weed, hip-hop, or something poor people and minorities enjoy, downvote it.   
- I'm Asian and avoid arguments in real life, but watch how mean I can REALLY get when I'm behind a screen.    
- I treat my dog better than I treat people, how can I sue my landlord for not allowing my untrained dog to bark all day?

1391,yuribotcake,1579242159,epwl62,Nan,"If it's too good to be true, it probably is. 

Found an amazing apartment on CL for $2500, slightly above what I am already paying. So figured I'd upgrade and be closer to my favorite spots. Sent an email. Then decided to go to the area and just look around and get a feel. While eating lunch I get a response from marc.noah@aol.com He says the unit is available. I text my friends who suggest that it's a bit low price for all the awesomeness and suggest I check Zillow. Pretty much same unit, for $5000/month. So I mail ""marc"" and I ask why the unit is so cheap. He responds with:

""Some agent post higher if they don't have direct contact with the landlord."" 

This is where I knew it was a total scam, $2500 a month difference, how would a realtor advertise someones property without having a direct contact. Just silly shit. And of course the next email comes, saying that the property is very popular and I should put my security down.

""The apartment will be available for viewing/move into on or anytime after January 28th, after which the current occupant have moved out and move in ready anytime thereafter. Regardless of reserving it now your rent start counting from the day you move into the apartment and if otherwise, you will get a full refund of the amount paid prior to viewing.

Meanwhile, Due to the high demand for this apartment right now, I will advise you reserve/hold the unit prior to viewing/move in on or anything after January 28th, which is the only way I can guarantee the unit for you. If you wish to proceed with the unit reservation, you are required to fill a booking/lease form with your information, the form will be send to you via email attachment to fill and make a booking deposit of the rent and refundable security deposit to the Landlord, whose bank details you Will find in the booking/lease form. With this, you have a hold on the unit prior to your final decision after viewing which include your move in or refund of your deposit.. Indicate your interest to enable me send the lease form.""

Sounds like a sincere red flag.

This guy also signs all his emais with:

Marc Noah
marc.noah@aol.com
DRE#: 1269495

So I look up the DRE (not knowing what it is) and find that there's a Marc Noah realtor. But he has his own website and mainly deals with huge luxury properties. Doesn't even make sense for him to waste time on a $2500/mo apartment. 

So I ask him if he could email me from @marcnoah.com and this is where I figured he'd know that I am aware of the scam. But no as I am typing this I get an email from him saying:

""I do only sales of properties over there""

Does he need a separate domain and maybe even a separate office to deal with rentals?

What I learned is to not use Craigslist. Last time I got scammed of $40 for background checks. Only to never hear back. 

From now on I will only use Zillow, or actual listings from realtor companies like MLS. Not sure I can even trust Westside rentals, since it's free.

My initial thoughts were to just hire a taco truck to hang by Pan Pacific park. Pretty cheap. But there are no seating and I am not sure you can drink???

Can anyone make some recommendations? Maybe somewhere unexpected? Or a restaurant that is big enough for 100 and wont require a buyout or expensive entrees?

Thanks!",LosAngeles,Where to host the wedding rehearsal dinner or brunch in LA for cheap?

1724,MacGroober,1579654794,es4aqn,Nan,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but.... got my car stolen a week ago.

Happened in DTLA in the arts district... a blue 2007 Acura MDX with Texas plates that I had just driven up from Texas 10 days before. Was only parked for about 4 hours (between 9pm and 1am). Came back, window smashed. 

Worst part? I had a bag in the car with all the paperwork (title/deed too) ready for an appointment with the DMV the next morning to get it registered in the state. 

Car has somewhat custom gold detailing (the Acura logos are all gold), so it's pretty identifiable. I filed the police report immediately, DMV has the heads up, and I've been scouring craigslist/offerup/auto trader/copart for the past week with no luck. Called several of the city tow lots to see if they may have taken it in either, with no luck. Called 311 to see if any parking tickets had been assigned to the vehicle either, no luck either. 

I know the recovery rates for vehicles are pretty high so i'm optimistic, but really wondering if there is anything else I could possibly be doing.",LosAngeles,Car stolen about a week ago...any other options?

My insurance ended yesterday and I was going to switch to my new employers plan and I just had a gut feeling that something was going to happen today haha. 

Pretty soon after I hit the car the owner came out of his house and called his son whose in his 30s. I was freaking out cause I haven‚Äôt got in a car accident before or hit anything as I recently started driving. That part of his truck was badly damaged so I figured I couldn‚Äôt have done all that but the sound when I hit it was pretty loud. He asked if I wanted to take to insurance or cash settlement. He asked me to throw out a number and I don‚Äôt anything so I just said $50 to see his reaction but he laughed and said $100 was still low but would do $200. I went to a nearby grocery store and took out $200 and we messaged each other the confirmation and settlement and that was it. 

After a while when I went back to my car I realized that some parts he pointed out to me like the lights I probably didn‚Äôt even hit cause my car is a lot smaller than his. The collision sound was decently loud (at least at night) but I feel like I bumped into similar areas that were previously damaged. Anyway the situation is over now and I‚Äôm really trying to save my money this year so $200 was really a bummer. Any other tips I should have handled the situation?

(I currently live in Minneapolis, MN - great city, not the best weather). I have a few questions that hopefully someone can answer and I need some advice from the community about where to live and what to expect from the city in general.

About me - Late 20's earning around 80K - I'm applying for jobs in the IT sector (business analysis) and hopefully will get something good in the next couple of months! 

Some questions: 

	\- Is it possible to get a decent enough place just for myself under $900-$1100 in a good area? 

	\- Is it possible to commute from above-suggested places to downtown through public transit?

	\- Is a car a necessity to live in this city?

I had KPCC on and I lowered the sunroof and remembered what my brother taught me about flicking a booger; he says you need ‚Äújazz hands‚Äù and to work your booger adjacent finger against the booger finger in order to actuate the booger to release its grip on your skin. But if you use the sunroof you have the advantage of the airflow to help the booger take flight. 

So there I was trying to get this huge, pointy, sharp booger off of my finger when suddenly I look into my rear view mirror and there‚Äôs this asshole riding up my ass! The douchebag almost rear ended me but I was finally able to get the booger off of my finger and now I had both hands on the wheel to help me get away from this weirdo behind me.

Fast forward 4 hrs later. I meet up with my brother at Nobu and tell him the story of what happened to me on the 5 and he stops me before I finish and he says ‚Äúme too!‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù

2266,vanschmak,1580117167,euln0v,Nan,"Dear Kobe,

From the moment
You started wearing the Lakers Jersey
And shooting impossible
Game-winning shots
In the Great Western Forum
I knew one thing was real:

I fell in love with you.
I even named my dog after you. 

I loved how you always gave it your all ‚Äî
From your mind &amp; body
To your spirit &amp; soul.

Just seventeen years old
Deeply in awe of you
I always watched the end of the tunnel.
I always knew youd be
Running out of one.

And so I cheered.
I cheered tip to end every game
After every loose ball for you.
You showed me your hustle
You gave all your heart
Because it came with so much more.

You played through the sweat and hurt
Not because challenge called you
But because I cheered you.
I cheered everything for YOU
Because that‚Äôs what you do
When someone makes you feel as
Alive as you‚Äôve made me feel.

You gave a twenty six-year-old his Laker dream
And I‚Äôll always love you for it.
But I can‚Äôt love you obsessively any longer.
You have given life all you had left to give.
My heart cant take the pounding
My mind cant handle the grief
And my body knows it‚Äôs hard to say goodbye.

And its not OK.
I‚Äôm not ready to let you go.
I want you to know now
I wish I could savor another moment one last buzzer beater.
The good and the bad.
We have given each other
All that we have.¬†

And we both know, no matter where you are next
You‚Äôll always be that kid
With the hardest shots
Me cheering in the corner
:05 seconds on the clock
Ball in your hands.
5 ‚Ä¶ 4 ‚Ä¶ 3 ‚Ä¶ 2 ‚Ä¶ 1

Love you always,
Kobe fan",LosAngeles,A letter to Kobe

2411,SmellGestapo,1580249671,evcnro,Discussion,"SB 50, Sen. Scott Wiener's housing density and transit bill, will be heard on the floor of the Senate tomorrow.

The bill would

1. Automatically legalize up to a fourplex on anything currently zoned for single family housing only
2. Upzone areas around train stations and bus stops to allow up to about five story buildings
3. Give cities up to two years to come up with their own plans to produce the same amount of housing that SB 50 would produce before SB 50 actually overrides them

At least four LA-area Senators are on record opposing SB 50:

Holly Mitchell (Culver City/South LA)

Henry Stern (Malibu/Thousand Oaks)

Anthony Portantino (Pasadena/La Canada Flintridge)

Ben Allen (Westside/South Bay)

I explained I had just lost my phone and could they please call my number to see if it rings anywhere.  They looked at me like I was a creep and said no and kept walking.  After looking around further, I walked into the UCLA store nearby.  The cashier had my phone!  She said someone had turned it in!

I‚Äôm old enough to remember the Mexican swine flu and Ebola, and how batshit crazy and racist everyone became. Let‚Äôs not have a repeat of this folks. 

So let‚Äôs have a basic discussion on how not to be a racist asshole:

- not all Asians are Chinese

-Yes, you do look like a huge asshole if you go around asking people their ethnicity for the purpose of targeting them 

-it doesn‚Äôt even matter if one is Chinese. The US case incidence rate is almost nonexistent, with almost no transmission. Most of the people suffering are in China/Wuhan, the people who actually need the attention and support

- it‚Äôs hella weird to talk about geopolitics or the Chinese government in regards to a virus, especially with ordinary Chinese people. Don‚Äôt be that guy 

-even if you are concerned, there are credible sources of information you can follow. Your racial biases are not, and Asian people are under no obligation to accommodate them 


Although, it‚Äôs kinda interesting that the only group that never suffered harassment or targeting of this kind is white peoples despite the prevalence of anti vaxxers.",LosAngeles,Just FYI : We Asians don‚Äôt appreciate your racist coronavirus jokes or harassment.

They've got some questions to ask and I'm looking for someone who'd be ready to answer their questions (which I have recorded on video and which I will send you if you're willing to help us).

I think this would be a great for my students at so many levels :) Among the questions they have:

\&gt;Why did you leave your country, what did you choose the USA ?

\&gt;What do you think about Trump ?

\&gt;What is difficult to learn English?

\&gt;Is it hard living in the US?

etc.

The only two requirements: 1) To answer their questions in video or audio.

2) Preferably, I'm looking for someone who was not born in the US but moved to the US at some point in their life.

I'm putting this list together for myself as much as anyone who is curious, but are there any I'm missing?  

[Nuart](https://www.landmarktheatres.com/los-angeles/nuart-theatre) in West L.A., always something worth checking out.

[Aero](http://americancinemathequecalendar.com/calendar_aero) Santa Monica, one of two theaters programmed by American Cinematheque.

[UCLA film &amp; television archive](https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events)

[Egyptian](http://americancinemathequecalendar.com/egyptian_theatre_events)  Hollywood, the other American Cinematheque spot, former silent movie palace in the Egyptian Revival style just a block from the Chinese theater. American Cinematheque also had a screening of The Right Stuff at The American Legion Hollywood Post 43 in Hollywood, which I learned about weeks after the fact.

[LACMA](https://www.lacma.org/programs/film) has an excellent theater, but either they're not showing much right now or their website is just really confusing.

[New Beverly](http://thenewbev.com/) ""As long as I'm alive, and as long as I'm rich, the New Beverly will be there, showing double features in 35mm."" - Quentin Tarantino, who also managed to give this theater a shout-out in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood when Sharon &amp; Jay are walking in to El Coyote. 

[Last Remaining Seats](https://www.laconservancy.org/last-remaining-seats) Seasonal. L.A. Conservancy's series of classic films playing at historic theaters, usually downtown (in June?)

[Arclight](https://www.arclightcinemas.com/) &amp; [Laemmle](https://www.laemmle.com/) theaters both have the occasional film event.",LosAngeles,Film events in Los Angeles: theater guide

Anyways, reddit sucks ass for meetups, but [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) sucks ass for writing detailed descriptive shit.... they have a 4k character limit which just ain't gonna do for describing this shit.

When? FRIDAY February 21st at 8:00PM till SUNDAY February 23rd 2:00AM.

&amp;#x200B;

Come when you can means that you can literally come when you can. You  don't have to come at the exact start date and time, you can come  whenever the hell you want at any point between the start and end time,  and also leave whenever you want. Nobody is going to force you to stay,  and if anyone tries that shit.... please let me know!  


The idea  here is getting on the two extremes of the senses. We're combining  DARKNESS with MUSIC, karaoke to be exact... there will always be a  singer, you just might not see them.  


Most people probably won't  be looking at the karaoke screen anyways, because the start of the show  is going to be the Milky-Way, that giant ass disc we're surfing on!  Everyone will be able to see it with their shamefully naked eyes. You  won't need a telescope, it's going to be THAT DARK.  


Yes, that  means the lyrics are going to be darkened (and color adjusted) too, so  that we maintain the darkness. Unfortunately, we're going to have to  even go as far as cutting off the Karaoke VERY EARLY in order to enjoy  the night sky, Karaoke ends at 2:00AM. This is when everyone is  sleeping, shut the fuck up time begins. Don't worry, we'll have an ""I  don't sleep at night"" all-night sitting and chatting area located at the  far end of the lot from the sleeping area, so if you do wanna chat, you  can do it till no roosters start crowing because we're in the middle of  fucking nowhere.  


100 MILES OUTSIDE OF LA? Yeah, we can't do this shit near where anyone lives, we've gotta do it in the boondocks where it's 100% legal and bothers NOBODY. No doubt, some hipster is going to start screaming at me about the poor endangered desert tortoise that's going to be tortured by our music. No, there's nothing out here. I checked personally. So unless you give a fuck about an ant colony, I don't want to hear about it. The area is fenced in and cleared, there is not a shred of greenery, the ground has been compacted, there are not even any snake holes, nothing lives out here, and nothing ever will unless someone takes down the wildlife barriers and somehow replants the local landscape, the area is figuratively scorched earth. It's also a designated campsite and maintained and operated, and yes we will NOT be violating ANY noise ordinances. This is all 1-legal.

But what if I don't have a car? I'll update this post with a link to our CARPOOL SIGNUP SHEET. RIDERS MUST PAY DRIVERS A MINIMUM OF $20 PER WAY PER PERSON ($40 TOTAL FOR ROUND TRIP), this is a 100 mile drive outside of LA. This is not an Uber ride to the Airport. Gas, insurance, and maintenance are expensive, and they might have to put up with some shit. They deserve to be compensated for their time and energy just like you do!

100 MILES OUTSIDE OF LA? Yeah, we can't do this shit near where anyone lives, we've gotta do it in the boondocks where it's 100% legal and bothers NOBODY. No doubt, some hipster is going to start screaming at me about the poor endangered desert tortoise that's going to be tortured by our music. No, there's nothing out here. I checked personally.

It's also a designated campsite and maintained and operated, and yes we will NOT be violating ANY noise ordinances. This is all 100% legal. I know because I asked the people that needed to be asked!

That's  right folks, there is no address here. Just directions. Fortunately  they are simple and I will draw maps and stuff, and google pins.... If  you can figure out google maps, or have any gps of any kind, you can  make it. Good thing everyone has a smartphone! (I'm sorry non smartphone  owners, I'll provide detailed maps and pictures). 

The current closest googlable city to the location is Atolya, CA. The location and all maps and drawings and pins will be messaged to everyone that RSVP on the meetup page. An RSVP is REQUIRED for this event, we'll be in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night, you may NOT show up announced! RSVP IS REQUIRED THIS TIME, you must sign up for a [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) account or know a friend who has one and be their +1.  Alternatively, you can RSVP on my official karaokefest chatroom by downloading the signal app then searching for my number (again listed on meetup.com)  


So let's talk about cost, first i'll tell you what's free:  


BATHROOMS!  They're free, and we'll have shuttles every hour, and you may be  required to volunteer to drive people over in your car if you attend and  drive, they're 15 miles away. Potable water is free via water fountain,  free trash, free recycling, free toilets, free sink use.  


WHAT'S NOT FREE:  


This event has a cost, you must agree to all of the following:  


1-  You agree to sing at minimum, one song, at any time you like. Non  singers may not attend. I'm being serious. This isn't ""come stare at the  stars and ignore the music festival"". This, in fact, is KARAOKE FEST.  We will have wireless microphones and you will have the capability to be  completely hidden from everyone's view, if you wish. Go sing behind a  car, I don't care. Just do it once, it's not all I ask.  


2- You  agree to VOLUNTEER your time and energy at ANY TIME when asked, in the  name of keeping all of this shit free. I don't want to hire a bunch of  people to do shit, and you don't want to pay for me to hire a bunch of  people to do shit..... So do shit for me and I won't ask you to pay  me.... Sound fair? Also, if you have a driver's license, you are  required to submit your name for volunteering for our hourly Shitter  Shuttle. People gotta shit, and you gotta shuttle em sometimes.... Just  keep the windows down in the car and everyone will be fine.  


3-  You agree to PACK OUT (this means clean up trash) at a rate of TWICE THE  AMOUNT OF TRASH YOU GENERATE! Meaning if you create one bigass trashbag  of trash, you must go find enough trash in the desert to fill up  another bigass trashbag of trash. It won't be hard, trust me, sad!ly  this desert is littered with trash :( There is more but I ran out of  characters!",LosAngeles,"The first (ever, as far as i know, and I haven't googled) KaraokeFest: Karaoke under the new moon, dark sky, and stars."

Anyways, I have a 65lb gray Staffordshire Terrier and I'm moving to LA. 

You would see him and could think
a) what an adorable, handsome doggo
b) that is a monster (tense up, watch your mother, watch your children) 
Or c) that guy needs a yard and some fresh air somewhere out of this metropolitan

If your reaction would be (b), this post is not for you. 

If you are a responsible dog owner in LA, can you provide any words of wisdom?

Anyways: 
He was neutered the day I got him 2 years ago. (4 yo now)
He has a prong collar.
He is super (almost too friendly, where's the loyalty?) to people and children.  
Very goober looking. No cut ear tips. More lean than muscle.
I'm getting renter liability insurance.
I'm going to struggle to find an apartment near work downtown.
I'm getting him licensed.
He is chipped.
He is lazy AF. Sleeps all day. Sometimes too lazy to go outside. Never barks. Never chews anything up. 
And unfortunately, he barks back at dogs that bark at him. 
He has not been through classes yet. We get by pretty well at the moment.

Thoughts? I'm sure he'll be fine but from what I hear, LA has a bad history with the breeds of his type.",LosAngeles,moving to LA with a pitbull.

Sometimes in LA you find a parking lot that is actually a portal to hell. All Trader Joe's lots fall into this category but there are others. The California Chicken Cafe on Melrose has a tiny, cramped lot that has delivery drivers going in and out of it at the same time people are double parking or inventing their own spaces. I hate it so much that I sometimes contribute the problem by ordering it through an app instead of going there.

PINK HAUS possesses a mixture of modern indie with nostalgic new wave influence, sometimes foraying into dream pop, shoegaze and even vaporwave.

As I am from California myself, I am volunteering to ask around to see if any longboarders are willing to contribute any of their GoPro recorded or similar videos of their skating adventures. All credit will be given where due for volunteers. Old and new footage alike is appreciated, we only ask that it is during a sunny day (especially during sunshine) so it matches the vibe of the song.


Regardless of whether or not you would like to participate, thanks for checking out my post! If you know someone off of the net who may be interested, please do let us know.


Cheers!

I am originally from Upstate NY so Long Island is a culture shock as it is. We both work full time, no kids, and our student loans are paid off. I run a video and audio production company, as well as work a full-time job that is completely remote. My wife works in HR. We currently own a house here in Suffolk County NY. In other words, as long as I have reliable and fast internet access, I can quite literally work from anywhere.

Not really in any rush to leave but due to the nature of my work I am weighing options on places to live long term. Her parents are here, but truthfully considering I feel like we're in a unique opportunity for our age, I'd like to be in a place with nicer weather. Plus, it's really expensive here (our property taxes are about $12k, which truthfully isn't that bad for the area). For reference, we own a 2900sq foot colonial. It's a huge house for two people. Sometimes I feel like I'd be happier in a condo, other times I love this place. Los Angeles or San Diego is expensive, and you get a lot less land for the money, but the weather is better and the people are way nicer. But, aside from one or two friends I know, neither of us know anyone there.

The people of Long Island are OK, I get along with them, but everyone here is, to put it simply, stressed as *fuck*. I don't know why, but maybe just that NYC mentality. I also have no commute, so maybe that's why I'm not stressed. LOL. SoCal people always seem more laid back...which could be good, or bad, depending on the individual, I guess. Or maybe it's just my interpretation. 

Just bouncing ideas off people. Obviously everyone will have their opinion. One of the big things I don't like about Long Island is that I feel like I'm a minority for being a transplant (I originally came here for work but left once my business took off). My wife is from here, which could be an issue in convincing her to leave her family...that's a typical NYC/Long Island syndrome.

Our budget would probably be around, max $600k.

Anyway, just looking to start discussion. Am I nuts, or is this something you think I should consider? Thanks all!",LosAngeles,Young couple: Long Island to LA or San Diego?

3392,BinaryBlowfish,1581314781,f1m588,OC,"Hey everyone,

Several months ago I informed my landlord of Bill 1482, which limits rent control to 5% + cost of inflation. However, he responded by saying that our apartment is actually exempt, but failed to explain why or how. I read online that exemptions include: 

* Properties that were built within the past 15 years
* Owner-Occupied duplexes
* Single-family homes
* Housing that‚Äôs subject to more restrictive rent control ordinances

Our apartment does not fall under any of these categories. Now we have received an email from him demanding we sign a document that says the following: 

[https://imgur.com/a/xniR5Qs](https://imgur.com/a/xniR5Qs)

There's no reason listed in his document other than a clause that demands a landlord include to justify exemption. Does this seem shady or is that all a landlord needs to say in order to exempt our unit from Bill 1482? To make matters worse he just raised our rent by 10%, which is tough to swallow.

As soon as I see this post is approved, I will post the details for the karaoke festival.

&amp;#x200B;

For now I'll just say a few things. This is a DARK SKY karaoke fest, We're going to be singing while looking at stars and constellations. Telescope nerds highly encouraged. There will be separate areas for karaoke and dark sky viewing.

RSVP will  be required for safety as this will be in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere. Nobody that did not RSVP will be allowed physical entrance to the campsite.

ANY CAR can get to the location without damage to it.

Let's see if the mods keep this post up, I'll fill in the details later if they do, and I will create my own competing r/losangeles subreddit and leave this subreddit forever and never return if they don't, it's up to them, I don't care either way at this point.",LosAngeles,"Ok, let's try this again.

While cause investigations continue, driver impairment is strongly suspect. 

We hope you and your loved ones had a safe and restful night. 

Please be aware though, that while you and I rested, public safety personnel performed this unenviable task...

- - - 

It is most often the duty of law enforcement or the Coroner's office to make death notifications. By all accounts, ""the door knock"" remains one of the most dreaded tasks in public safety. 

Walking up the driveway to a house in moonlit darkness, there is nothing but the empty sound of leaves or gravel beneath your feet, punctuated by the inevitable deep breath and long exhale of those in your group who are equally dreading their duty. Not a one likes to think that hours earlier, the deceased walked that very path. 

Sometimes a dog will bark, but most often it is the knuckles of a veteran Police Officer that will punctuate the solitude with a firm knock upon the door that might as well be cannon fire. 

Having done it. More deep breaths, as house lights come on - a scurry - as a person in semi-dream state asks ""who is it?"". Those three words will be the last ones spoken in a normal tone by the family that morning. 

The door soon opens, often by a blurry eyed spouse or parent in a tattered robe who kindly accedes to our request to enter their home. 

Before we have a chance to get them seated and explain... the ""Oh no, Oh no..."" phase commences. Sobs are stifled as they allow us to explain what they're hoping isn't true. 

The wails that follow take our breath away, and we attempt to be strong, as we patiently wait to see what we can do. At this moment, I can assure you that every member of the ""door knock"" team thinks of their own family. 

Things don't always go well or settle down quickly, and sometimes the task can take hours. The only thing worse that can happen is to have a family member, especially a young child, be awakened by the screaming and enter the room. 

I'll leave it there - as I assure you it isn't a task that any of us would wish upon our worst enemy.

Here's my views as a liberal on the races:
Offices No. 17, 131, &amp; 141:
The candidates in these races are all running unopposed, so they're gonna win no matter what. To that end, they don't have to campaign and there's not much information on them. For Office No. 17, that's a little disappointing. Shannon Kathleen Cooley [donated](https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=32719474) $250 to the mayoral campaign of [Kevin James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_James_(broadcaster)). (James's views have [evolved](https://medium.com/@heykevinjames/making-the-switch-from-republican-to-democrat-9ca654925d78) since then.)

Office No. 97
Powell good, Reuben ran for office as a Republican in past years

Office No. 129
Maccarley - Republican
Moss - Few endorsements
Fuller - Many endorsements, young

Office No. 145
Montalban has multiple Dem endorsements, but took a very concerning action ([failing to provide evidence to the defense team](https://knock-la.com/district-attorney-with-a-history-of-misconduct-wants-to-judge-you-e4a6df040099)) while acting as prosecutor. Slaten is an attorney who [misrepresents his credentials](http://www.metnews.com/articles/2020/editorial012320.htm) to get on TV, providing commentary for Fox News, CNN, Nancy Grace, &amp; Dr. Drew. But his campaign is somewhat progressive. Both candidates are ethically questionable. I wish there was a third choice in this race.

Office No. 150
Tom Parsekian has major Dem and progressive endorsements. Most of his donations have gone to Dems, though he's [donated](https://www.opensecrets.org/search?q=thomas+parsekian&amp;type=donors) to a couple of Republicans in the past.

Modern Albuquerque is a modern architectural/art organization based in Albuquerque, where wouldn't you know it, we appear to have a building inspired by the demolished Armet and Davis-designed diner located right here on Route 66! I've been back and forth with the ADN architectural firm, but unfortunately, they can't easily access the drawings for Holly's Diner. In order to adequately compare the two sites, I'm chasing down photos that I can scale to see if key measurements match. Armet and Davis are listed as consulting architects on the Albuquerque building's plans, but neither that firm nor the Albuquerque architects that completed the plans have a record of the collaboration. 

Albuquerque's diner is now known as Loyola's and opened in 1958 as Sherm's, two years after Holly's. It is also used as a filming location, most famously in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. 

If you have photographs of Holly's / Hawthorne Grille or know of an archive that may have some images accessible for research purposes, we'd appreciate the opportunity to look through them!

So a few months ago I got jury duty, but a new employee was starting at my job the same week I was supposed to have it so I postponed so I could make sure I was there to train them. I postponed it to the 2nd week of March, so coming up soon. 

Now, I'm about to start a new job next week and I really don't want to have jury duty so soon into this new job. But, since the last time, I've lost my paper giving me my juror number and every time I call the automatic phone system it prompts me to put that number in before I can reach an actual person. 

I know you can postpone two or three times, and it's coming up fast so I really need to figure out a way to postpone again. Any advice would be VERY MUCH appreciated. Thanks in advance!",LosAngeles,Postponing Jury Duty

Unfortunately, we all know this is a complicated situation and I really would like to hear your observations about how this homelessness came to be. In my experience, with how Reddit works, upvotes and downvotes obscures less popular opinions.

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

So did Trump &amp; his ""impeachment"" team Nadler,Schiff,Mueller.So did media moguls Redstone,Murdoch,Moonves. What are they trying to set up? **Who can arrest them since they are all bribed and in on it ?**

Their strategy to stay in every office and obstruct until forced to leave no matter what. Feigning impeachment: see page 13O. Iunuedlmner, kvrmnvkmltr;w wmomvtikwe wmkmownvtt.

To me this seems like a poor decision. I think they should leave the patients positive with Covid-19 at Travis Air Force Base and not risk infecting others while transporting and quarantining at this site. Worse, the way the Feds are dealing with this raises suspicions about their ability to deal with clusters of cases should they arise here in the next few weeks/months. 

From the article: The federal agencies‚Äô response Sunday said ‚Äúthere is no requirement that a federal agency consult with and incorporate local government any time the agency makes decisions; indeed, such a requirement would cripple the federal government.‚Äù

Arguing against transparency is the opposite of how this disease needs to be handled. It became a global threat to begin with because of lack of transparency by officials in Wuhan. While they were busy worrying about meeting Q1 production targets, thousands were kept in the dark about the risks facing the city. The lesson- Citizens need to know what‚Äôs going on so they can take necessary precautions to avoid spreading the disease. Arguing that they don‚Äôt need to consult with local governments is ridiculous.",LosAngeles,Costa Mesa Coronavirus Quarantine Thoughts

I had no, luck and the shelters are closed today. So I'm going to take her in overnight and take care of her. She is very sweet, but seems lost and confused for sure. If anyone has any idea who owns this dog, please contact me in a PRIVATE MESSAGE!

I'll be putting posters out around my area as well, but I figured sometimes reddit can work their magic!",LosAngeles,LOST DOG! GRAY FEMALE PITBULL FOUND IN HOLLYWOOD AREA.

I just attempted to vote at Ramona Hall in Highland Park and there was a line of about 40 people waiting outside to check in. A sign directed voters to avoid any wait by going to the Vote Center less than a mile away at Loreto Elementary School and sure enough there was literally no line there.

You may vote or drop off your Vote by Mail ballot at any vote center in LA County: [https://locator.lavote.net/locations/vc](https://locator.lavote.net/locations/vc)

Note that for unhoused residents registering TODAY with cross streets (instead of a numbered address) you will need to get your local precinct confirmed (Vote center will call registrar) to ensure you receive down ballot races in the City of LA as well. If you registered w/ cross streets previously you shouldn't have this issue.",LosAngeles,LA Vote Center wait times vary: 30min+ wait vs. 0min wait less than a mile apart

5583,Sugarcola,1583723157,ffo7lu,Nan,"I'm originally from the valley but moved away a some years ago. I never really traveled much elsewhere outside the SFV.

I have the opportunity to stay for 1 month in LA in any Air BnB/Hotel/etc.

What area (specifically) should I stay in in LA?

---------------

**What I'm looking for:**

An easy area to walk around where I can just talk to/meet people. I just don't want to feel grimey like I'm walking around Koreatown on a 105 degree day.

A place where I can take a ""relatively short"" uber or public transportation ride to both Santa Monica &amp; Studio City. 

Walkable shop area near me.

People my own age range: 18-24

So far Brentwood/Westwood near UCLA seems like the best bet so far, but I honestly have only been in that area twice in my life years ago. 

Any tips are much appreciated. If you think there's a much better area to go and stay in than what I mentioned, lmk.

As you are aware, the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to remain of the utmost public concern. For several weeks now, the Paley Center, along with our venue host, The Dolby Theatre, has monitored the situation closely, staying in daily contact with local, state, and federal partners, as well as following the recommendations issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and following the guidelines of the local health department.


Based on the most recent news and out of an abundance of concern, we have made the difficult decision to postpone this year‚Äôs PaleyFest. While we were looking forward to presenting another stellar lineup of PaleyFest events, the safety of our event participants, guests, and staff is the highest priority.


We are exploring options to reschedule the festival and all ticket purchases will be honored for the new dates.


We will be in touch shortly with next steps and individuals who are unable to attend may email¬†CustomerCare@paleycenter.org¬†to request a refund.


We appreciate your understanding during this challenging time, and look forward to welcoming you to PaleyFest later this year.",LosAngeles,PaleyFest LA is postponed

You can talk with others about the lifestyle, common questions or problems, battling cabin fever, and even rant about your boss.

#Side Hustles

If you're looking for work or small jobs, consider /r/BeerMoney. They have a lot of resources to help you with finding a way to make money that are non-traditional. They also have an expansive list of other helpful subreddits.

#Clean Up

The City of Los Angeles's [Office of Community Beautification](http://laocb.org/) works with local districts to provide free trash bags, clean-up tools, tree-planting, and similar services to assist in making the streets more. Even if they can't get you things immediately, you can still look into what they offer and be ready when they area.

#Blood Donations

Right now, the American Red Cross strongly urges healthy, eligible individuals to schedule a blood, platelet or AB Elite plasma donation appointment to help maintain a sufficient blood product supply and avoid any potential shortages. The Red Cross also urges organizations to maintain scheduled blood drives. Donating is a safe process and people should not hesitate to give or receive blood or platelets.

6545,incontempt,1584449742,fk4rwy,Nan,"On Sunday night the Mayor of Los Angeles announced a moratorium on evictions. Here's how day one of that moratorium went, from my perspective on the front lines of the eviction wars.

I am part of a nonprofit representing tenants facing eviction in Los Angeles. We are often the last line of defense for clients who get turned down by other agencies for lack of capacity. We make capacity for pretty much everyone, on a flat fee sliding scale. 

On Monday morning I was in court continuing the 8 eviction trials we had set for that day. The cases are all jury trials and therefore cannot be heard anytime soon. These are tough times, but I am expecting a relatively light, easy day, and to get out quickly and sanitize.

While I am in court, a tenant whose case we lost tracks me down in the hallway and tells me she was locked out by the Sheriff last Friday, and that she's been sleeping rough since then. She tells me she hasn't eaten in two days. In a possible violation of State Bar rules, I hand her $10 and forget to tell her it is a loan (wink wink) and that she has to pay me back. She heads up to the cafeteria to get breakfast.

One of the landlord-side lawyers (who works for a firm that files 400 eviction cases per month) has gathered several of his clients together at the end of the hallway. They surround him ominously. Some of them wear masks. He tells them their cases will be continued due to the crisis. They are not happy. They want him to settle their cases, preferably to get their tenants out in 30 days. I overhear him telling them that no one has an incentive to settle because all cases are getting postponed.

Two hours later I am finished with my business but the evicted lady is back and making a ruckus in the hallway and the bailiffs warn me they will arrest her if it continues. I ask her to go to a County office for a hotel voucher. Fortunately, that gets her to leave without further incident. I immediately go to the men's room and wash my hands thoroughly.

I head back to my office to find a waiting room full of tenants with new eviction cases trying to hire us, including a family with a two-year-old who is screaming his head off in a stroller. Apparently our staff disregarded our directive to limit access to the waiting room to one person at a time. We thought business would be slow with people staying isolated, making intake easier to manage. No such luck.

We can't close down otherwise these tenants will get defaulted‚Äîthey have five days from.being served to answer the lawsuit‚Äîand then evicted. Evicted in the middle of a pandemic. We are not sure how to strike a balance between two bad outcomes‚Äîeither we close and these tenants have nowhere to turn, and get themselves evicted, or we stay open and risk hastening transmission of COVID-19. Like so many problems these days, there are no good solutions.

I tell everyone to write down their number on our sign in sheet and wait in the plaza outside the building, and that we'll call when we are ready. I lock our front door and post signs with these clear instructions. I head back to my desk to process notes from court.

Thirty minutes later I come out and the waiting room is full again. There is a different family with a different two-year-old in a stroller, screaming his head off. Staff is still not following instructions. They are young and aren't taking the public health directives seriously enough, and the protocol we created to allow continued operations is making their job more annoying. 

Worse, the evicted client from court shows up and refuses to leave. The county office is closed, she tells me. I get in touch with a county official who we had been working with to get her shelter to find out how to get her housed. He tells me LA county can't help her and gives me a bureaucratic excuse. 

It is 2pm. We have no capacity for more clients but new people are lined up outside the locked front entrance door with new cases, trying to hire us. Every couple minutes someone knocks. I tell everyone to come back tomorrow, that we open at 9 and they should get there early because it's first come, first served. I place a sign on the front door. I go home, walking past the homeless woman, who is spread out in the hallway outside the office with all her stuff littering the ground. Like so many others before me, I have made her someone else's problem.

Later that evening we learn via Twitter that the courts are closed starting Tuesday and plan to reopen Friday for ""essential"" services only. It's unclear so far what that means for evictions. Are evictions essential?

That was moratorium day one. Stay tuned for day two.",LosAngeles,"Eviction Moratorium Diary, Day One"

&gt;I've been through some rough times over the past 12 years, but this is already the worst thing I have had to deal with - and it is just going to get worse. Panera - closed, Starbucks - closed, libraries - closed, community centers and rec centers - closed, grocery stores - reduced hours and nothing left to toss in the dumpsters so no food along with no place to shower. Every place I try and get to for anything - even wifi - is closed. And all I can find out on the news is (of course) aimed at the fucking people who are just pissed because they can't burn the usual $50 for dinner that they are used to every day. This is the end. Either I die from the virus or commit a crime so they have to put me in jail where at least I won't have to worry about all this shit out here.",LosAngeles,The city is shutting down essential services for homeless people

----------------------------------------

**Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)** is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.

**[Common signs of this virus](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Kx8IBe-rxGDdezu3pq5jWm_szQ=/0x0:2616x1402/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2616x1402):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19782405/Coronavirus_Symptoms___WHO_joint_mission_2.png)** include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

Standard recommendations to **[prevent infection spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)** include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. **Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.**

The mortality rate is unconfirmed but believed to be about 2-4%, with a higher likeliness of death in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. An unknown incubation period (where you are infected without necessarily showing symptoms, and are able to transmit the virus) has made tracking it difficult. 


# COVID-19 Infections (as of 3/17/2020)

* Los Angeles: 144 cases 
* California: 700 cases 
* United States: 6,362 cases 
* Global: 197,830 cases

#COVID-19 and Los Angeles

Most of the country is being put into a forced ""social distance,"" where all large-scale events have been canceled and government officials are requiring all bars, entertainment venues, and fitness centers to be shut down, limiting restaurants to only take-out/delivery, and discouraging any sort of gathering that involves more than 10 people. This will discourage most people from going out to begin with- which is a step in slowing transmission. Though complete prevention is impossible, staggering the rate at which it occurs is a controllable variable *if* people adhere to social distancing by not congregating with large amounts other people. [LA County Health](https://twitter.com/i/status/1239041400064204800) shows that social distancing is a way to alleviate a sudden surge in the number of people infected at the same time, and will allow the healthcare system to continue providing adequate care.

As of now, [most schools in Los Angeles](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/fj8r39/covid19_school_and_college_closures/) will be closed for the foreseeable future, transitioning to online classes only. Many employers have told employees capable of working from home (WFH) to do so. Most professional/college sports have been postponed indefinitely, including all events at Staples Center and Dodger Stadium. 


#Groceries and Toilet Paper

No actions or events have had any large-scale effect on food production or distribution.

Amidst the uncertainty of quarantines, a large scale ""panic-buy"" began earlier this week. Stores began selling out of toilet paper and many groceries, and supply chains were maxed to capacity. Mayor Garcetti stresses that the situation should be [faced with preparation and preparedness](https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1238942461466005504), not panic. There is no food shortage, and tap water is perfectly safe to drink (though the taste will vary depending on your building).

Many stores have imposed a limit on toilet paper, bottled water, and certain sanitizing supplies to prevent price-gouging by resellers. Supply chains are being replenished and the amount of food on store shelves should return to normal soon, though long shelf-life items will likely take longer (a logistics factor).

The announcement of business closures and stock market crash has caused an additional panic-buy. Many users have noticed a lull in lines as of 03/17 and product stock seems to be replenishing normally.

#Daily Life

Daily life is about to be severely disrupted for most people. Children are being forced to stay home, adults are being told they cannot come into work and will not be paid (due to CA's ""at-will"" employment), and many people relying on side-hustles are worried about their income for the next month. Traffic will be lighter, downtown will look like the 90s.  If you've been putting off any exploring adventures, this may be the perfect opportunity. There will likely be many questions asked about how to make money during these next few weeks, and we'll get a Side-Hustle Megathread in the next few days.

#What should you do?

Pretend it's a long Coachella weekend and you're a very poor introvert. Traffic will be light, but don't go out. If you're able to work from home, do so. If you have to go into work, distance yourself 6-feet from people if possible. Avoid shaking hands, and wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching your face at all times. Buy Animal Crossing New Horizons or go play those 50 Steam games you never touched. Watch videos on How To Cook with basic ingredients instead of getting delivery. Saturday is *not* a Jumbo's Day right now.

#Posting Etiquette

Don't panic. Don't post screenshots of GPS traffic or photos of places with empty shelves and long lines- it doesn't really help anyone unless that happens to be there one local store. Even a Trader Joe's and a Target right next to each other will have different levels of stock if one is sold out. If you find a place with MSRP toilet paper or other high in-demand items, feel free to share for now.

Last week has been extremely stressful, losing production jobs and struggling to pay bills. And it's only gotten worse, not better.

The one saving grace is that everybody seems to understand this is unprecedented, it's well known that people will either be having a very hard time paying bills or won't be able to at all, and that something will have to give. (figuratively)

Knowing that I am not alone, and that in 2 years time any ""30 Days Late"" marks on my credit report will probably be able to be explained successfully (or maybe even expunged somehow), is helping me get though.

As a result, my dontgiveafuckometer is climbing. My stress level is going down, and whatever will be will be and it won't be for lack of trying.

Anybody feeling this?",LosAngeles,What's your DGAF-O-Meter at?

**Mayor Garcetti** 3/18 on Homelessness:

&gt;The Mayor has pushed to relocate 6,000 homeless individuals out of encampments and into beds at 42 city recreation centers.

&gt;With the City Council‚Äôs partnership, we are working on [a new program to offer emergency loans to small businesses](http://ewddlacity.com/index.php/microloan-program) affected by this crisis and a moratorium on commercial evictions for restaurants and businesses.




**Mayor Garcetti** 3/17 on Parking Enforcement:

&gt;We're lifting ticketing on street sweeping on residential streets &amp; making other changes to LADOT parking enforcement to help you during this difficult time. But enforcement will continue at metered spaces to help businesses &amp; restaurants relying on takeout &amp; deliveries.

**LA County Department of Public Health** 3/16 on business closures:

&gt;All bars, clubs, theaters, entertainment centers, and fitness centers are ordered to be closed until further notice. Restaurants will be permitted to serve take-out or delivery food only and grocery stores may remain open.

&gt;Gatherings of more than 50 people are strongly discouraged, in accordance with directions from the Centers for Disease Control.""

**Mayor Garcetti** 3/15 on business closures:

**Governor Newsom** 3/15 on state-requested actions:
&gt; Calls for home isolation of all 65+ year-old persons and those with chronic conditions.

&gt; Restaurants: Reducing occupancy by 50% (all LA City restaurants to be closed except for take-out/delivery).


----------------------------------------

**Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)** is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.

**[Common signs of this virus](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Kx8IBe-rxGDdezu3pq5jWm_szQ=/0x0:2616x1402/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2616x1402):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19782405/Coronavirus_Symptoms___WHO_joint_mission_2.png)** include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

Standard recommendations to **[prevent infection spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)** include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. **Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.**

The mortality rate is unconfirmed but believed to be about 2-4%, with a higher likeliness of death in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. An unknown incubation period (where you are infected without necessarily showing symptoms, and are able to transmit the virus) has made tracking it difficult. 


# COVID-19 Infections (as of 3/18/2020)

* Los Angeles: 190 cases 
* California: 865 cases 
* United States: 9,345 cases 
* Global: 218,177 cases

#COVID-19 and the Los Angeles area

Most of the country is being put into a forced ""social distancing,"" where all large-scale events have been canceled and government officials are requiring all bars, entertainment venues, and fitness centers to be shut down, limiting restaurants to only take-out/delivery, and discouraging any sort of gathering that involves more than 10 people. This will discourage most people from going out to begin with- which is a step in slowing transmission. Though complete prevention is impossible, staggering the rate at which it occurs is a controllable variable *if* people adhere to social distancing by not congregating with large amounts other people. [LA County Health](https://twitter.com/i/status/1239041400064204800) shows that social distancing is a way to alleviate a sudden surge in the number of people infected at the same time, and will allow the healthcare system to continue providing adequate care.

As of now, [most schools in Los Angeles](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/fj8r39/covid19_school_and_college_closures/) will be closed for the foreseeable future, transitioning to online classes only. Many employers have told employees capable of working from home (WFH) to do so. Professional/college sports have been postponed indefinitely, including all events at Staples Center and Dodger Stadium. All restaurants (except for take-out/delivery), bars, and entertainment venues are closed.

#LAUSD Grab &amp; Go Food Centers

Los Angeles Unified, in partnership with the Red Cross, will continue to provide nutritious meals to all students who need them during the temporary closure of schools. [Grab &amp; Go Food Centers](https://achieve.lausd.net/resources) will be open beginning Wednesday, March 18, and will be staffed weekdays from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. Each child can take home two nutritious meals.

#Groceries and Toilet Paper

* No actions or events have had any large-scale effect on food production or distribution. Certain stores may be sold out of specific products, but it is not a shortage.

* Price gouging [is illegal in California](https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#11C).

Amidst the uncertainty of quarantines, a large scale ""panic-buy"" began earlier this week. Stores began selling out of toilet paper and many groceries, and supply chains were maxed to capacity. Mayor Garcetti stresses that the situation should be [faced with preparation and preparedness](https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1238942461466005504), not panic. There is no food shortage, and tap water is perfectly safe to drink (though the taste will vary depending on your building).

Many stores have imposed a limit on toilet paper, bottled water, certain sanitizing supplies, and food items to prevent price-gouging by resellers. Supply chains are being replenished and the amount of food on store shelves should return to normal soon, though long shelf-life items will likely take longer (a logistics factor).

The announcement of business closures and stock market crash has caused an additional panic-buy. Many users have noticed a lull in lines as of 03/17 and product stock seems to be replenishing normally.

#City of Los Angeles Parking Enforcement

Mayor Eric Garcetti has relaxed parking enforcement across the **City of Los Angeles**, putting a temporary halt to the issuance of several citations so that Angelenos can more effectively practice the safe social distancing necessary during the outbreak.

* Relaxed enforcement of street sweeping restrictions in residential areas

* Relaxed enforcement around closed schools

* Moratorium on ticketing and towing for abandoned vehicles and oversize vehicle overnight parking fines

* Freeze on parking fine increases for the next 60 days

* Extended grace period for people dropping off or picking up groceries and goods

* Immediate extension on all deadlines for payment due until June 1

The relaxed enforcement will be in place until March 31, and is subject to extension. **Enforcement will be maintained on operations that prioritize health, safety, and emergency access ‚Äî including colored curbs, street sweeping around encampments, peak-hour restrictions, and repaving and slurry operations. It will also continue at metered spaces to encourage parking turnover for businesses and restaurants relying on takeout and deliveries.**

#City of West Hollywood Parking Enforcement

The City of West Hollywood has proclaimed the existence of a local emergency in response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health emergency. A Resolution with this proclamation was added to the City Council agenda as an Urgency Item and was approved by the City Council of the City of West Hollywood at its regular meeting on Monday, March 16, 2020. The proclamation enhances the City of West Hollywood‚Äôs ability to access emergency resources at the state and federal level to assist with its novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) response. [More info.](https://www.weho.org/Home/Components/News/News/9190/23)





#Commercial Evictions

According to the Mayor‚Äôs order on commercial evictions, which will be in place until March 31 unless extended, ‚ÄúNo landlord shall evict a commercial tenant in the City of Los Angeles during this local emergency period if the tenant is able to show an inability to pay rent due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These circumstances include loss of business income due to a COVID-19 related workplace closure, child care expenditures due to school closures, health care expenses related to being ill with COVID-19 or caring for a member of the tenant‚Äôs household who is ill with COVID-19, or reasonable expenditures that stem from government-ordered emergency measures.‚Äù

A provision in the order gives eligible tenants up to three months following the expiration of the local emergency period to repay any back due rent.

#Senior Meals and Grocery Shopping

The Department of Recreation and Parks is working with the Department of Aging to [distribute pre-packaged meals to older adults](
https://www.laparks.org/covid-19) Monday through Friday. Distribution times vary depending on the location. Each center will offer a grab-and-go meal service. Older adults may pick up their meal or assign someone to pick it up on their behalf. Download and view the complete list of locations and times: [Senior Nutrition Dining Sites During COVID-19 Closure](https://www.laparks.org/sites/default/files/pdf/press/Senior%20Nutrition%20Dining%20Sites.pdf)

#Daily Life

Daily life is about to be severely disrupted for most people. Children are being forced to stay home, adults are being told they cannot come into work and will not be paid (due to CA's ""at-will"" employment), and many people relying on side-hustles are worried about their income for the next month. Traffic will be lighter, downtown will look like the 90s.  If you've been putting off any exploring adventures, this may be the perfect opportunity. There will likely be many questions asked about how to make money during these next few weeks, and we'll get a Side-Hustle Megathread in the next few days.

#What should you do?

Pretend it's a long Coachella weekend and you're a very poor introvert. Traffic will be light, but don't go out. If you're able to work from home, do so. If you have to go into work, distance yourself 6-feet from people if possible. Avoid shaking hands, and wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching your face at all times. Buy Animal Crossing New Horizons or go play those 50 Steam games you never touched. Watch videos on How To Cook with basic ingredients instead of getting delivery. Saturday is *not* a Jumbo's Day right now.

#Posting Etiquette

Don't panic. Don't be a dick. Don't post fear-mongering or conjecture, and don't post screenshots of GPS traffic or photos of places with empty shelves and long lines- it doesn't really help anyone unless that happens to be there one local store. Even a Trader Joe's and a Target right next to each other will have different levels of stock if one is sold out. If you find a place with MSRP toilet paper or other high in-demand items, feel free to share for now.

Don't retreat into fear amidst all this craziness going on. The champions that arise will be the ones that remained positive, continued to work hard and were only taking steps forward while everyone else was taking 5 steps backward.

**Some possible positives amidst all that's going on...**

* Global powers to accelerate the development of a global pandemic response system to be better prepared in the future. üåé
* Fewer cases of the flu due to people practicing better hygiene. üßº
* Better health overall due to an increase in home-cooked meals and consumption of vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables. üçéü•¨
* Companies forced to create work from home policies and might be surprised by the positive results. üìà
* More time with family. üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
* More time to read and work on side hustles. üòú

I hope this isn't insensitive and wish everyone good health, success, and perseverance through this adversity we all are experiencing.

We will get through this together like we always have and we will come out so much stronger.

Since we've been out of town a while, we don't have any groceries at home. I was wondering what the current situation is with grocery stores in LA (we live in north K town, so we could go to grocery stores anywhere in K town, silverlake, east Hollywood, etc). 

Has anyone been to grocery stores recently? Like today or yesterday? Are they super crowded still? Is it difficult or impossible to get certain foods?

I am planning to relocate from my organization's office in Santa Monica to their one in downtown Denver. Has anyone lived in both places? I would love to hear which one you prefer and why.

\-------------------

BACKGROUND

I am (30/f) originally from Maine and have lived in: West Virginia, San Francisco, San Diego, and London.

What I love about LA: restaurants, temperature weather, diversity, superb comedy shows, educated &amp; ambitious population, and close proximity to hikes/beach. 

What I think I will like about Denver: seasons, a great dating scene for women, proximity to the outdoors, affordable, walkable, and direct flight to Maine.

7643,405freeway,1585065435,fo7glt,Discussion,"As we reach the end of the month, there is a lot of uncertainty, confusion and anger among renters.

An **Eviction Moratorium** has been implemented in many cities, which prevents tenants from being evicted, and offers some people up to 6 months to repay back rent. This does not forgive rent that is owed, and many don‚Äôt explicitly prevent late fees from being charged for any delayed payment.

Many landlords are still requiring on-time payment for rent, despite nearly 1/3 of the state‚Äôs jobs being considered non-essential and those workers not allowed to work. This juxtaposition of a contractually obligation to pay rent when you are legally forbidden from doing your job, with no warning, notice, or opportunity to procure a new stream of income, has become extremely problematic and stressful for the average working class household.

Combined with the staggered length of time **Safer At Home** is supposed to last, many are torn: do renters pay $1500-$2500 in rent (if they even have it), while having no job, and no guarantee of income, and risk having no money to buy groceries by the end of April? And even if they don‚Äôt pay rent now and don‚Äôt face eviction, and let the owed rent stack up, they face a limited window to find work and make enough money once the quarantine is lifted- essentially having to earn 8-9 months of rent with 6 months of income, regardless of if they can find a job the day the Order is lifted.

The Orders all state that they may be extended beyond April 19th, with estimates being adjusted to June or even August. Can families with only $1500 left make it last that long, even if it‚Äôs just for food?

A lot of people are mentioning a **rent freeze** (a law not allowing rent rates to be increased), **rent moratorium** (a law that prevents landlords from demanding rent until the quarantine is lifted), and a **rent strike ** (organized effort to have all tenants refuse to pay landlords since evictions are currently unenforceable).

There is a domino effect on non-payment, as rent typically goes to paying off the mortgage, maintenance, and taxes associated with the property. Rent is the primary source of money used to pay the bank and government. A rent moratorium would subsequently have to be a **mortgage moratorium**. If renters don‚Äôt pay, neither should landlords- but that all rests at a greater state and federal level decision.

What do you think about these things, and this situation in general?",LosAngeles,"Rent Freeze, Rent Moratorium, and Rent Strike Discussion"

As the coronavirus pandemic has grown in the U.S., blood drive cancellations have grown at an alarming rate. To date, nearly, 2,700 Red Cross blood drives have been canceled across the country due to concerns about congregating at workplaces, college campuses and schools amidst the coronavirus outbreak. These cancellations have resulted in some 86,000 fewer blood donations. More than 80 percent of the blood the Red Cross collects comes from drives held at these locations.

**Volunteer donors are the only source of blood for those in need. If you are feeling healthy and well, please contact your local blood bank.**

The Red Cross expects the number of cancellations to continue to increase, which is causing heightened concern for blood collection organizations and hospitals across the country. This blood shortage could impact patients who need surgery, victims of car accidents and other emergencies, or patients suffering from cancer.

#[Homeless Help](https://corona-virus.la/english/mayor-garcetti-announces-thousands-temporary-shelter-beds-homeless-angelenos-part-covid-19)

* Partnering with the City Council to use $20 million in budget reserve funds on emergency relief efforts

* Adding an initial 1,600 emergency shelter beds in thirteen City recreation centers, and scaling up to dozens more locations with more than 6,000 beds provided by the American Red Cross.

* Working with the County, LAHSA, and other partners to identify individuals in the homeless population who face the greatest risk from the novel coronavirus.

* Activating the Disaster Service Worker program, which will place some City employees in temporary roles to assist efforts.

# [COVID-19 Infections](http://lavirus.info) (as of 3/22/2020)

* Los Angeles: 409 cases 
* California: 1,816 cases 
* United States: 35,530 cases 
* Global: 354,677 cases

#[COVID-19 and the Los Angeles Area](https://corona-virus.la/)

Most of the country is being put into a forced **social distancing**, where all large-scale events have been canceled and government officials are requiring all bars, entertainment venues, and fitness centers to be shut down, limiting restaurants to only take-out/delivery, and discouraging any sort of gathering. This will discourage most people from going out to begin with- which is a step in slowing transmission. Though complete prevention is impossible, staggering the rate at which it occurs is a controllable variable *if* people adhere to social distancing by not congregating with large amounts other people. [LA County Health](https://twitter.com/i/status/1239041400064204800) shows that social distancing is a way to alleviate a sudden surge in the number of people infected at the same time, and will allow the healthcare system to continue providing adequate care.

As of now, all ""non-essential"" services are prohibited. ""Essential services"" are listed above.

Daily life is severely disrupted for most people. Children are being forced to stay home, adults are being told they cannot come into work and will not be paid (due to CA's ""at-will"" employment), and many people relying on side-hustles are worried about their income for the next month. Traffic will be lighter, downtown will look like the 90s.  If you've been putting off any exploring adventures, this may be the perfect opportunity- but go alone. Do not associate with anyone outside of your household, and keep 6-feet between everyone in public. 

**Don't go out if you don't have to.** You are still legally allowed to, but it is strongly discouraged.

Pretend it's a long Coachella weekend and you're a very poor introvert. Traffic will be light, but don't go out. If you're able to work from home, do so. If you have to go into work, distance yourself 6-feet from people. Avoid shaking hands, and wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching your face at all times.

#[Groceries and Toilet Paper](https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-highlights-uninterrupted-food-supply)

* No actions or events have had any large-scale effect on food production or distribution. Certain stores may be sold out of specific products, but it is not a shortage.

* Price gouging [is illegal in California](https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#11C).

Amidst the uncertainty of quarantines, a large scale ""panic-buy"" began earlier this week. Stores began selling out of toilet paper and many groceries, and supply chains were maxed to capacity. Mayor Garcetti stresses that the situation should be [faced with preparation and preparedness](https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1238942461466005504), not panic. There is no food shortage, and tap water is perfectly safe to drink (though the taste will vary depending on your building).

Many stores have imposed a limit on toilet paper, bottled water, certain sanitizing supplies, and food items to prevent price-gouging by resellers. Supply chains are being replenished and the amount of food on store shelves should return to normal soon, though long shelf-life items will likely take longer (a logistics factor).

* breathing difficulties

Severe cases may result in:
* pneumonia
* severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
* kidney failure
* death.

**[Infection prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)**:

* Wash your hands regularly
* Covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing
* Thoroughly cooking meat and eggs
* Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. 
* Practice **social distancing** by standing at least 6-feet away from other people at all times when possible.

The mortality rate is unconfirmed but believed to be about 2-4%, with a higher likeliness of death in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. An unknown incubation period (where you are infected without necessarily showing symptoms, and are able to transmit the virus) has made tracking it difficult. It is anticipated that half of Californias will be infected at some point.

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,‚Äù White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House‚Äôs National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.‚Äù",LosAngeles,"Good news. Apparently 2 Trillion stimulus package has been approved and will be voted on today. Most adults will get direct payments of up to $1,200... I say anything helps!!!"

They are constantly being cleaned, the managers and staff keep food stocked up, and deal with all sorts of issues far beyond the scope of what they were hired to do. They are giving me a legit face mask, gloves, and disposable jumpsuit every shift, something my own department has failed to do. I'm beyond impressed with them.

I just wanted to spread this video around. Many people are feeling the stress of the US economy plummeting and I think this video by Second Thought will help more people put into words what they are feeling and thinking. 

He has a very good argument in this video about the college debt bail out and Medicare for all. Why is it expensive to give the majority something that will be beneficial, but not that expensive to give share holders 2 trillion dollars in a few days?

I ask that you share this video and get more people to understand that our society has major issues that we shouldn‚Äôt look over. Especially now that we see the cracks in our system, and the evil people trying to profit from this emergency.

Checked the billing statement and realized that dreaded [$5 WiFi Service fee](https://awesomejelly.com/time-warner-spectrum-wireless-fee/). Can almost guarantee this is what's causing the speed issues. What's worse is that one must call in and speak to a live representative to deactivate. First couple of calls resulted in disconnected from spectrum. I've now resorted to requesting a callback. Hopefully it'll be resolved soon.

So lessons learned:

- **Turn off automatic billing** - Should've seen this coming.
- **Follow up** - Make it a habit to review these hidden fee details annually. 
- **Fuck spectrum** - I really wish we had options for ISPs.

Today, I received a letter saying that I violated the Metro Express lanes from 110SB Adams Blvd -&gt; 110SB Jefferson Blvd. 

I did drive on 110 on that day because I had to go down for a meeting in Torrance, but I did not use their express lane. They have a photo of my license plate on the letter, but it's a zoomed/cropped photo of my license plate.

I checked through the google street view, and all freeway lanes from Adams Blvd to Jefferson Blvd aren't even express lane.

How do you dispute this? I don't see any options on the ticket. I don't know how they got the photo, but I never use the express lanes not even by mistake and also set my google map to avoid any tolls..??

8664,WhichEdge,1585714858,fssiqx,Discussion,"Someone recently did a fantastic post about marketing and how China is purposely not reporting both number of true infections/fatalities and how bad it is in a general sense in Wuhan and larger Hubei province because they want the media to focus on places like Italy, Spain, and the US.

This allows them to disappear off the world stage and avoid responsibility and media attention for the massive amount of suffering, death, and financial loss of so many.

I have never been much of a conspiracy person but the sad reality that there is more than a fair share of evidence about the lab in Wuhan and COVID-19 is damning enough.

On top of that Wuhan, the wet markets, and over all China have been a problem when it comes to Viruses for quite some time.

After this is all over and the amount of sheer death and misery this has brought I hope it is never forgotten that China is responsible.

The people are amazing and I think victims as much as many in this but the government and the system in China is disgraceful and should have to pay for what they have done to the world and its citizens.

If you disagree wait till someone you know gets sick or passes away. This virus is beyond horrific.

Don't wait till it is in your back yard or affects/effects you and your family directly to be outraged. Your voice can actually mean change in China after this whole thing is done and don't let anyone tell you different.",LosAngeles,China is to blame!

8823,dpotter05,1585793939,ftdzqj,Nan,"As this outbreak continues, many of us are going to struggle with paying rent. Here's what I've found for renter protections in CA state, LA county, and LA city during this outbreak. Please let me know if there's anything here I need to add or edit.

**CA State:** 3/27 Gov. Newsom issued an [executive order](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.27.20-EO-N-37-20-text.pdf) which prohibits landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent through 5/31 if you notify them within 7 days after the rent was due that you have to delay payment on all or part of your rent, due to:

- You suspect you or anyone in your household or family has covid-19, or
- You experienced income reduction related to the outbreak, or
- You had to miss work to care for a child whose school was closed.

If you're claiming income reduction, you may provide it ""to the landlord no later than the time upon payment of back-due rent."" Plus, normally you have five days to respond to Unlawful Detainer notices (landlord lawsuits to begin the eviction process). Gov. Newsom has extended this to 60 days.

**Los Angeles County:** The first step for a landlord to evict you is to give you a notice to pay or quit (can be as short as a 3 day notice). The second step is for them to file an Unlawful Detainer law suit against you in LA County court. LA County courts have suspended operations until June 22. There is currently no legal way for a landlord to evict you before then.

 - [Suspension notice](http://www.lacourt.org/pdf/2020-GEN-006-00AdministrativeOrderofPJreCOVID-19032320.pdf)
 - [As posted here](http://www.lacourt.org/pdf/COVID19TimelineofEvents-03302020\(Final\).pdf)

The last step after a judge has granted an eviction is for a sheriff's deputy to place a 5 day notice on your door telling you to leave. If you're there after 5 days the deputy can physically remove you. Before this, your landlord can't make you leave and is prohibited from harassing you (e.g. shutting off your utilities, removing doors or windows).

**LA City:** Mayor Garcetti issued an emergency order 3/15 prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants who are able to show an inability to pay rent due to the covid-19 outbreak, and tenants will have six months to pay back their rent starting when LA's emergency order expires. 3/30 [LA City Council extended this to 12 months](https://hcidla.lacity.org/covid-19-eviction-moratorium).

**Type of Protection:** CA state and LA city's protection is in the form of an ""affirmative defense"". When your landlord sues you (unlawful detainer), you can argue before the judge the eviction should not be granted because you can show your reason for nonpayment was covered by the governor's or mayor's orders.

**Eviction Process:** Here is a break-down of how the eviction process works in LA County.

Normally this requires the new plates being shipped to your local DMV office and then you‚Äôre required to go into the DMV with your old plates to exchange them for the personalized plates. However, the DMV isn‚Äôt taking any new appointments and doesn‚Äôt allow walk ins at this time. I thought I was out of luck until the corona restrictions were lifted. But today the DMV called me and offered to mail me my new plates and told me to destroy the old ones after they‚Äôve been received. I thought this was great except they could have just done this anyway, even without the virus restrictions. Why were they requiring requiring people to come in person in the first place?",LosAngeles,DMV Services

9009,Ex__,1585937572,fuddic,Discussion,"Hello all! I don't know about the rest of this town, but I sure do enjoy movies. In this post I'm going to share a list of movies that:

A.) Are watchable, possibly even entertaining.

B.) Take place in Los Angeles. Some may simply have just a scene or two in Los Angeles whereas others are fully written for a Los Angeles setting. Some may even be fictional locations that were neverless filmed in and highly resemble the Los Angeles area.

Most of these are mainstream movies so no real gems in this list, but I encourage others to contribute in the comments. I realize that not everyone has watched everything, so I'll provide insight that assumes you haven't seen the film yet.

# Movies that take place in a non-fictional Los Angeles setting

* **Double Indemnity** (1944) - Takes place in DTLA, the golden standard of noir, required watching IMO. Also, a great film to reference to trick people into thinking you have in-depth knowledge of cinema; trust me, I do it all the time.
* **Sunset Boulevard** (1950) - Takes place in Hollywood (duh), another noir classic with some gallows humor, required watching.
* **Rebel Without a Cause** (1955) - Generally takes place and was filmed in Westside, the quintessential James Dean flick, required watching.
* **Beverly Hills Cop** (1984) - Film opens in Detroit, but Acts II and III of the plot largely takes place in Beverly Hills. Vintage Eddie Murphy movie, probably the only movie in this franchise worth watching IMO. Has a 4k release.
* **The Terminator** (1984) - Film takes place all over Los Angeles. Great James Cameron flick, probably his best. Has a great melding of horror, action, and scifi. Also has a very welcome lack of John Connor and plenty of naked muscle mens for the guys and gals who like that.
* **Die Hard** (1988) - Takes place in Century City at the Fox Plaza (has a fictional name in the movie). This and Die Hard 3 are the only ones worth watching IMO, especially since Die Hard 3 had McTiernan return to direct. Excellent action film, probably one of the more intelligently written films of that genre you'll find. Has a 4K release
* **Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure** (1989) - Takes place in San Dimas, in the San Gabriel Valley. Early Keanu vehicle, has a cameo by George Carlin, a sick ass montage with Extreme's Play With Me, and is a good time to watch. This is a fairly distilled 80s film with all the 80s tropes, but still holds up IMO. Good thing to watch if you're planning on catching the sequel later this year.
* **Pretty Woman** (1990) - Takes place in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. A classic romcom rags to ritches film, it was a indication of shifting attitude sin filmmaking due to the romantic female lead being a bona fide prostitute. Stars Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, and presumably, Richard Gere's hamster, although uncredited. Solid flick and features a badass chick ballad ""It Must Have Been Love"" by Roxette.
* **Boyz N The Hood** (1991) - Takes place in South Central. John Singleton's (RIP) magnum opus. Themes are centered around fatherhood, institutional racism, and gang culture. A very early example of when Cuba Gooding Jr. was tolerated on screen and when rappers were starting to take prominent feature film roles. Great cast all around, including Laurence Fishbourne and the very lovely Angela Bassett. Required watching.
* **Terminator 2: Judgement Day** (1991) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. For better of for worse, this film changed cinema forever with its extensive and innovative use of CG. Another stellar cast, one of the most celebrated action films of all time, and that is in spite of the unfortunate presence of John Connor. I should tell you now, after you watch this one, you should know that the franchise ends here. There are no more films in the franchise, and there's no need to Google that, just take my word for it. Anything you see that suggests otherwise is just a deep state conspiracy designed to trick you. Has a 4K release that has a contentious reputation.
* **Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey** (1991) - Takes place in San Dimas again. This film is honestly garbage. The plot is even more non sensical than before although Death is very funny. Has a cameo by hot Pam Grier and Primus performing Tommy the Cat. Worth a watch to prep for the sequel at least.
* **Resevoir Dogs** (1992) - Takes place in Eagle Rock. The breakout film of our Blessed Lord and Savior Quentin Tarantino, praise be to him. This is the movie with the scene that gets parodied a lot, the scene where MR. White tortures the cop to the tune of ""Stuck in the Middle with You"". It was ridiculously well cast and has the trademark Tarantino dialogue and semi non-linear storytelling. It has some misteps in the shooting and acting of some of the scenes, but was one of the most successful independent films of all time, and was able to briefly convince the world that Michael Madsen could act.
* **South Central** (1992) - Takes place in South Central, of course. Another afro-centric film set in South Central that has fatherhood as a central theme, along with gang, drug, and prison culture. Great film all around, with some complex character writing. An Olver Stone produced film that has Glenn Plummer starring. It actually holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, although with only 6 reviews, albeit one of which is the main man Roger Ebert.
* **Menace II Society** (1993) - Takes place in South Central. The antithesis to Boyz N The Hood. If the central theme to Boyz N The Hood is to show the role a strong father figure plays in the upbringing of a boy in the hood (!), this film shows an outcome where said father figure is not present. It also portrays the protagonist as a morally grey character, which is refreshing. You pity him, but also don't make excuses for him. Stars a young Larenz Tate and Jada Pinkett-Smith, along with MC Eiht (Rapper, also voiced Ryder in GTA: San Andreas).
* **Pulp Fiction** (1994) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. The magnum opus of our Blessed Lord and Savior Quentin Tarantino, praise be to him. Simply put, you are not allowed to live in this town if you haven't seen this movie. A master class in neo-noir. I cannot sing its praises enough, and honestly, I don't have to. Y'all mtherfuckers undoubtedly already know what's up. Required watching. Has a 4K release.
* **Friday** (1995) - Takes place in South Central. This film is, arguably, one of the best comedies of all time in my opinion, and I will die on that hill. The humor ebbs and flows with a supreme organic quality. There is likely never a joke in this film that isn't going to make you laugh. Huge cult following, a breakout film for Chris Tucker back when he was worth a damn, and definitely Ice Cube's best work. Required watching.
* **Clueless** (1995) - Takes place in Beverly Hills. Stars Alicia Silverstone and Stacey Dash before she absolutely lost her fucking mind. Fellas take note, this is a good one to add to your repetoire to score some points, as well as broaden your horizons. Has a solid cult following as well.
* **Heat** (1995) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. This film was highly anticipated due to it being the first time Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear on screen together and it didn't disappoint. Also has Val Kilmer and Jon Voight, as well as a young Natalie Portman. This film was criminally snubbed by the Academy, one of the more wretched sins they've committed. The action sequences are well choreographed and in particular, the sound editing and the gun choreography are superb (they actually use the sights when aiming). Heavy recommend if you have a home theater AV set up. Has a 4K release.
* **Swingers** (1996) - Takes place in Hollywood, although a large part of Act I goes to Vegas. Breakout film for Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn, and Ron Livingston (main character of Office Space). A guy film if there ever was one. A great one to watch after a breakup or if you're jaded from dating in Los Angeles in general or if you're prepping for a weekend excursion to Vegas. Also a great [Unintentional Period Piece](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece) for the 90s (yeah I linked to TV Tropes, fuck your schedule). Required watching for the fellas.
* **Jerry Maguire** (1996) - Takes place in both Los Angeles and Arizona although primarily L.A. A solemn reminder why Tom Cruise still has a net worth. I want to hate him so much, but I unfortunately can't, thanks to this film. Also stars Cuba Gooding Jr, Regina Kind, and Renee Zellweger. Solid flick despite some cliche.
* **L.A. Confidential** (1997) - Takes place in Los Angeles, promintently in Hollywood. A significant accomplishment, a ridiculous ensemble cast that included 90s Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, and more, this film got nominated for a ton of awards, although it lost most of them to gross ass Titanic. Required watching.
* **Liar Liar** (1997) - Takes place Los Angeles, mainly DTLA. Personally, I think this film is the best example of Jim Carrey's style of humor done RIGHT. In his other films, his over the top acting just comes off as grating after a while, but in this film it doesn't really get old. It's also one of the first films where he did more than just his usual slapstick and physical comedy and actually applied his acting ability with emotional depth. Film's humor still holds up and is a great and easy watch.
* **Boggie Nights** (1997) - Takes place in the San Fernando Valley, aka the Porn Capital, and is very fitting for the movie's subject matter. Another stellar 90s film that broke a ton of rules and has it's own style. Huge ensemble cast including Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham (why is she so perfect?), Don Cheadle, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William Macy, John C. Reily, and MORE.
* **Jackie Brown** (1997) - Takes place all over Los Angeles, mostly South Bay. The first film made by our Blessed Lord and Savior Quentin Tarantino, praise be to him that features a linear storyline. Was conceived as an homage to blaxpoitation films of the 70s and very fittingly stars Pam Grier, the star of Foxy Brown. It has another ensemble cast of Samuel L Jackson, Robert De Niro (playing against type), Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda, and more. Not groundbreaking work, but very solid film.
* **Rush Hour** (1998) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. The first of the trilogy and the only one worth watching. This is back when Tucker still had something to offer on screen. Was a farily fresh take on the buddy cop dramedy formula that was undoubetedly stale by the time this movie came out. Has some good Jackie Chan stunts and good laughs. The scene where Chan and Tucker bridge their cultural gap is actually fairly endearing. Soundtrack was also fire, I had it on cassette back in the day. Franchise stops here though.
* **American History X** (1998) - Takes place in Los Angeles, mainly Venice Beach. If there was ever a film for required watching in these turbulent times, its this one. Story is about a reformed white supremacist and details the process of how misguided youths are indoctrinated to racist ideology as well as how institutional racism effects and stokes racial tensions. Also a story about the folly of vengeance. Superb acting by Edward Norton and I mean it, he's a real bastard in this one. Absolutely required watching.
* **Memento** (2000) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. Early Christopher Nolan film and as you can imagine, has been incredibly well received and has received widespread acclaim and an outstanding legacy. Go watch this shit if you haven't already. You will see the early markers of Nolan's cerebral signature style that went to make Inception.
* **Baby Boy** (2001) - Takes place in South Central. Another afro-centric film by John Singlteton, this film is a commentary on the negative aspects of contemporary black culture that are perceived to be limiting or holding back the development and betterment of black men. And before any reactionaries out there have something to say, it has nothing to do with racism. Stars Tyrese Gibson in the lead, although it was originally conceived for Tupac before he died. Also has Taraji P Henson, Snoop Dogg, and Monique, among others.
* **Training Day** (2001) - Takes place in South Central and Watts. The film that finally got Denezl Washington his Oscar after the Malcom X and Philadelphia snubs. Also stars Ethan Hawke, but who really cares? Has cameos by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as well, and a few other names you'll recognize. Great film, largely based on the Rampart scandal of the 90s. Plot is ok, but Denzel absolutely nails this movie.
* **The Italian Job** (2003) - Takes place in Los Angeles, most prominently in Hollywood. This movie is honestly pretty dumb. The cast is not bad at all, with Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Greene, Edward Norton, and a couple other names. Theron and Norton put up the best performances, but it doesn't matter because the way the plot progresses is dumb as all hell. The most egregious of this is a split between Seth Greene's implausible hacking exploits and literally everything that has to do with that mechanic character. The reason why its even on this list is that despite the lackluster plot and acting, the film is pretty to look at and has some good shoots and action sequences. It's basically visual junk food.
* **Crash** (2004) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. Another drama with an ensemble cast with a uniqe style, great writing, well shot, well acted, and has a well deserved legacy, contentious as it is.
* **The 40-Year-Old Virgin** (2005) - Takes place in the San Fernando Valley, mainly Encino. Judd Apatow's breakout film, and IMO his best tied with Bridesmaids. Excellent humor that still holds up and features excellent acting by Steve Carrell. Manages to avoid some of the cliche of this style of comedy, such as in how Trish was written to be more than a typical love interest and how other characters were generally more complex and flawed. Also, a solid period piece for the mid 2000s.
* **Knocked Up** (2007) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. A very respectable followup to Judd Apatow's follow to The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Stars Seth Rogen as the lead with Katherine Heigl, it definitely still holds up. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are also brought back who later went on to star in a spin-off movie of their own that I haven't bothered to see because my sixth sense told me it was bad (I heard Megan Fox was in it). Very funny, although it being a romcom, we knew Rogen was getting the girl, so it suffers from being a bit formulaic.
* **Superbad** (2007) - Takes place in Westside. The quintessential teen movie of my generation and a perennial beloved favorite fo the genre. Stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill and introuced Christopher Mintz-Plasse to audiences at large. I loved how unlike the John Huges era of teen movies where teens where always a part of some watered down idyllic suburbia, Superbad managed to show exactly the kind of shit tons of teenagers were really getting up to. Partying, sex, substance consumption, hormones, and the like. Obviously teenage millennials aren't a monolith, but I stand by this perspective. Required watching.
* **Iron Man** (2008) - Act II and III takes place in Los Angeles, mainly Westside and South Bay. Yes, the first one was in Los Angeles, although the setting was not at a focal point of the plot. Anyway, this is the film we all know and love (or hate) for spawning the MCU. Surprsingly enough, it still holds up.
* **Blood and Bone** (2009) - Takes place in South Central I think. This is a direct-to-DVD movie that is a guilty pleasure of mine and a cult classic. It stars Michael Jai White and Eamonn Walker (Said from Oz). Also has some appearances by a handful of MMA fighters, most promintently Bob Sapp. It's basically an ego piece for Michael Jai White. The plot is dumb and formulaic, the acting is cheesy, the score sucks, and the dialogue shallow and stilted. So why do I like this movie? The fight scenes, plain and simple. Seeing that big MF Michael Jai White destroy MFs is pretty fun to watch. Again, it's visual junk food.
* **Black Dynamite** (2009) - Takes place in Los Angeles. A well known parody, homage, and love letter to 70s blaxpoitation films, this one also stars Michael Jai White although in a much better role and far better written movie. Has tons of cameos by tons of comedians, most notably Cedric Yarbough who upstages them all. This movie is like Arrested Development turned up to 11 in that there are so many inside jokes, easter eggs, and references that it will take several watches to catch them all. The word ""parody"" is thrown around these days with absolute reckless abandon, so if you're confused on the concept, this movie should clear things up for you. Required watching.
* **End of Watch** (2012) - Takes place in South Central. A gritty cop drama presented as a fictional documentary, this one stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. It tackles the themes of gangs and cartel violence. It's notable in that it doesn't focus on police corruption at all and instead shows the honorable and upstanding side of the police. A solid police procedural if you're tired of the gritty corrupt cop drama.
* **Stretch** (2014) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. Stars Patrick Wilson as the lead, with supporting roles by Chris Pine, Jessica Alba, and Ed Helms. Also has hilarious cameos from Ray Liotta and David Hasselhoff. An underrated comedy that I'm sure will reach cult status someday, it's a distilled contemporary Los Angeles adventure in a noir presentation and is a good watch.
* **Nightcrawler** (2014) - Takes place all over Los Angeles. Stars Jake Gyllenhaal. Movie is a commentary on MSM sensationalism and is worth every minute to watch. Got tons of awards including an Academy nomination.
* **Dope** (2015) - Takes place in Inglewood and Ladera Heights. Despite the R rating, it can be considered a teen movie for the Gen Zs and is definitely a coming of age film. It's actually really well written and has a great style to it. Stars Shameik Moore as the lead and Forrest Whitaker as the narrator with some other names peppered in, the plot is about a high school senior finding his identity while navigating his way out of a situation involving drug dealers. Heavily features 90s rap culture and referneces, so A+ for me.
* **The Nice Guys** (2016) - Takes place in Los Angeles. A solid buddy cop dramedy, which avoids the cliches with great writing and acting, courtesy of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. Guaranteed future cult classic.
* **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood** (2019) - Takes place in Hollywood and parts of the Valley. Yet another solid offering from our Blessed Lord and Savior Quentin Tarantino, praise be to him. This is another one of his alternate history films, this time deling with the Manson family. The film is lead by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, with appearances from Kurt Russell, Al Pacino, Margot Robbie, and TONS of other names. Film has its controversies, no doubt levied by those who would rather walk in the shadow of our Blessed Lord and Savior Quentin Tarantino, praise be to him, than his light. A fun watch if you don't take the film too seriously.

# Movies that partially take place in Los Angeles

* **The Godfather** (1972) - This film has a scene in the first act where Tom Hagen flies out to Hollywood in order to beseech Jack Woltz to give up the movie role for Johnny Fontane. The shots of old Hollywood are ddefinitely a treat to look at. I'm not even going to wast electricity singing this film's praises. I'm of the opinion that if you don't like this film, you are likely descended from a weak bloodline and actively holding the human race back with your undoubtedly meager existence. Don't @ me though.
* **The Usual Suspects** (1995) - Has the scene with the attempted assasination of Kobayashi set in L.A. and the raid on the boat in San Pedro. The film that beat out Heat in 1995, this film has 90s Kevin Spacey and is praised for it's writing, pacing, and famous twist, as well as several iconic scenes. Even manages to make a lesser Baldwin brother watchable.
* **Kill Bill: Volume 1** (2003) - Act I takes place in Pasadena, where The Bride encounters Vernita Green. This is an film brought to us by our Blessed Lord and Savior Quentin Tarantino, praise be to him. Has significant amounts of trademark Tarantino style and pays homage to several genres, as Tarantino is wont to do. Has a dope ass anime sequence leading into Act III, which definitely helped further accelerate maintstream acceptance of anime in Western audiences. A fun watch.
* **Sideways** (2004) - The scene where Miles picks up Jack takes place in L.A. Sideways is an independent film that did very well and brought Paul Giamatti a solid leading role and much acclaim. The film itself has some undue prententiousness to it (it's about [sommeliers](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/08/the_most_infamous_study_on_wine_tasting.html) so what do you expect?), but if you can look past that, it is a solid watch and also serves as a virtual tour of the California coastline.
* **Forgetting Sarah Marshall** (2009) - The vast majority of the film is actually in Hawaii, but it begins and ends in L.A., presumably Hollywood. Stars Jasaon Seigl, best bae Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Russell Brand, with a few other SNL appearances. This is definitely another guy romcom that is good to have for a breakup. Its humor also holds up very well.
* **Get Him to the Greek** (2010) - A film that goes to several locations, but begins and ends in Los Angeles. Stars Russell Brand and Jonah Hill as a loose spin-off to their Forgetting Sarah Marhsall characters, with Nicholas Stoller still directing. Despite a very regrettable portrayal of male rape and the almost equally regrettable casting of P. Diddy, it's a decent enough watch to get a few laughs out of it, especially if you like Russell Brand's brand of humor.
* **Inception** (2010) - The very first dream layer the team enters is in DTLA. Also, the plane they're all on is headed to Los Angeles. Considered by many to be the best of Nolan, this is a film that is cerebral representation of dealing with grief all in the guise of a sci-fi action thriller. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, and a few others.

# Movies that take place in a fictionalized Los Angeles

* **Blade Runner** (1982) - Takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles future. Movie is a sci fi classic directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford. The plot is centered around rogue synthetic humans and is a forerunner in the human vs. synths plotlines that we've seen time and again since. Has a huge legacy and got a bona fide sequel 35 years later.
* **Back to the Future** (1985) - Takes place in Hill Valley, a fictional city in California, but is filmed in and resembles San Gabriel Valley cities such as Glendale and Pasadena. Back to the Future is so popular that I'm not even going to bother typing more than that.
* **Back to the Future Part II** (1989) - Alnternates between a high technology future and a dystopian future in Hill Valley.
* **Back to the Future Part III** (1990) - Takes place in a frontier version of Hill Valley.
* **Demolition Man** (1993) - Takes place in a dystopian alternate timeline of Los Angeles, that become San Angeles in the future. This is another guilty pleasure of mine. Stars Sylvester Stallone, Sandra Bullock, and Wesley Snipes, among others, with a bit role for Robert Schneider. The movie is pretty bad, but still entertaining. The acting isn't bad at all, in fact Snipe's gave a great performance and the humor is really good. However, the films aesop is not very subtle, especially with Leary's little rant. They may as well just write ""political correctness is bad, mkay"" on a baseball bat and beat you over the head with it. Still, a fun watch.
* **There Will Be Blood** (2007) - Takes place in Little Boston, which is near Signal Hill and referenced in the film I believe. There Will Be Blood is, in my opinion, the best Revisionist Western we've had to date, and is renowned for it's superb writing, unconventional story telling, Daniel Day Lewis being Daniel Day Lewis, and the cinematography. Absolutely one of those movies you can watch several times and find something new to like.
* **Blade Runner 2049** (2017) Takes place in a dystopian future in Los Angeles. Sequel to Blade Runner after 35 years, and was an excellent followup. I wonder if this is some kind of a record?

Thats it for my list. Don't feel like proofreading it, so I apologize for any grammatical errors.

9223,RandomGerman,1586062579,fv87m6,Nan,"I am currently parked in Orange county so I drove to LA today. Had to get out of the apartment. 

I was able to drive from the 4th street bridge through downtown, to Hollywood. Cruised around there a little. Drove down Fairfax. Then to Santa Monica and along the Pacific Coast Highway to Topenga Canyon Road. And all this in 90 minutes. I was not even racing. 

No wonder people who grew up in LA hate us imports. If traffic was like that 20 or 30 years ago then I would miss that too.

Observation: EVERY Trader Joes I drove by had a long line of people around the block (not really social distancing) and every Starbucks had a long line of cars as if it was a In and Out burger (Which always has a long line).

Great day during a sad time. 

Stay safe and healthy everybody.",LosAngeles,Went cruising in LA today. Where? Everywhere??!!

&gt;For the moment, these tests are strictly limited to residents of Los Angeles who are in the most high-risk categories and most vulnerable.

&gt;Individuals eligible for testing at this time include:

&gt;* Those with symptoms who are 65 and older

&gt;Parks still remain open for walking or running; however, when visiting a park for exercise or respite, you MUST adhere to the City‚Äôs Safer at Home social distancing directives and must not participate in recreational group sports or activities that are incompatible with the City‚Äôs social distancing mandates.

#[LA County Park Closures](https://parks.lacounty.gov/covid-19/)

&gt;Out of an abundance of caution and in accordance with guidance from State and local health officials to prevent the spread of COVID-19, LA County Parks is temporarily closing the County multi-use trail system.

&gt;At this time, you can still enjoy time outdoors at your local park for passive use, such as walking, jogging, or leisure time outdoors for individuals or families. Social distancing is still required, and group gatherings are prohibited by the health order.

#[COVID-19 and the Los Angeles Area](https://corona-virus.la/)

&gt;Most of the country is being put into a forced **social distancing**, where all large-scale events have been canceled and government officials are requiring all bars, entertainment venues, and fitness centers to be shut down, limiting restaurants to only take-out/delivery, and discouraging any sort of gathering. This will discourage most people from going out to begin with- which is a step in slowing transmission. Though complete prevention is impossible, staggering the rate at which it occurs is a controllable variable *if* people adhere to social distancing by not congregating with large amounts other people. [LA County Health](https://twitter.com/i/status/1239041400064204800) shows that social distancing is a way to alleviate a sudden surge in the number of people infected at the same time, and will allow the healthcare system to continue providing adequate care.

&gt;As of now, all ""non-essential"" services are prohibited. ""Essential services"" are listed above.

&gt;Daily life is severely disrupted for most people. Children are being forced to stay home, adults are being told they cannot come into work and will not be paid (due to CA's ""at-will"" employment), and many people relying on side-hustles are worried about their income for the next month. Traffic will be lighter, downtown will look like the 90s.  If you've been putting off any exploring adventures, this may be the perfect opportunity- but go alone. Do not associate with anyone outside of your household, and keep 6-feet between everyone in public. 

**Don't go out if you don't have to.** You are still legally allowed to, but it is strongly discouraged.

Pretend it's a long Coachella weekend and you're a very poor introvert. Traffic will be light, but don't go out. If you're able to work from home, do so. If you have to go into work, distance yourself 6-feet from people. Avoid shaking hands, and wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching your face at all times.

#[Groceries and Toilet Paper](https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-highlights-uninterrupted-food-supply)

&gt;Amidst the uncertainty of quarantines, a large scale ""panic-buy"" began earlier this week. Stores began selling out of toilet paper and many groceries, and supply chains were maxed to capacity. Mayor Garcetti stresses that the situation should be [faced with preparation and preparedness](https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1238942461466005504), not panic. There is no food shortage, and tap water is perfectly safe to drink (though the taste will vary depending on your building).

&gt;Many stores have imposed a limit on toilet paper, bottled water, certain sanitizing supplies, and food items to prevent price-gouging by resellers. Supply chains are being replenished and the amount of food on store shelves should return to normal soon, though long shelf-life items will likely take longer (a logistics factor).

&gt;No actions or events have had any large-scale effect on food production or distribution. Certain stores may be sold out of specific products, but it is not a shortage. Price gouging [is illegal in California](https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#11C).

#[LA City Residential Eviction Moratorium](https://hcidla.lacity.org/covid-19-eviction-moratorium)

The Mayor issued a temporary moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent for tenants who are unable to pay rent due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These circumstances may include:

* Loss of income due to work place closure or reduced hours due to COVID-19
* Loss of income or child care expenditures due to school closures
* Health care expenditures stemming from COVID-19 infection of the tenant or a member of the tenant‚Äôs household who is ill with COVID-19
* Reasonable expenditures stemming from government ordered emergency measures.

The Mayor‚Äôs Order emphasizes that tenants are still obligated to pay lawfully charged rent. However, during the emergency period, tenants may not be evicted for failure to pay rent due to the financial impacts related to COVID-19. Tenants will have up to six (6) months following the expiration of the local emergency to repay any back rent due. Please note that the City Council may extend the repayment period as necessary in response to the emergency. From the Order:

&gt;Finally, I hereby order that no landlord shall evict a residential tenant in the City of Los Angeles during this local emergency period if the tenant is able to show an inability to pay rent due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These circumstances include loss of income due to a COVID-19 related workplace closure, child care expenditures due to school closures, health care expenses related to being ill with COVID-19 or caring for a member of the tenant‚Äôs household who is ill with COVID-19, or reasonable expenditures that stem from government-ordered emergency measures. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to mean that the tenant will not still be obligated to pay lawfully charged rent. Tenants will have up to six months following the expiration of the local emergency period to repay any back due rent. Tenants may use the protections afforded in this subsection as an affirmative defense in an unlawful detainer action.This subsection shall remain in effect during the pendency
of the local emergency period. This order may be extended prior to March 31, 2020.

The Order does not specify late fees that my be charged.



#[Commercial Eviction Moratorium](https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-announces-economic-relief-package-small-businesses-impacted-novel-coronavirus)

According to the Mayor‚Äôs order on commercial evictions, which will be in place until March 31 unless extended, ‚ÄúNo landlord shall evict a commercial tenant in the City of Los Angeles during this local emergency period if the tenant is able to show an inability to pay rent due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These circumstances include loss of business income due to a COVID-19 related workplace closure, child care expenditures due to school closures, health care expenses related to being ill with COVID-19 or caring for a member of the tenant‚Äôs household who is ill with COVID-19, or reasonable expenditures that stem from government-ordered emergency measures.‚Äù

A provision in the order gives eligible tenants up to three months following the expiration of the local emergency period to repay any back due rent.

**Parking Enforcement:**

#[City of Los Angeles Parking Enforcement](https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-relaxes-parking-enforcement-part-emergency-response-novel-coronavirus)

Mayor Eric Garcetti has relaxed parking enforcement across the **City of Los Angeles**, putting a temporary halt to the issuance of several citations so that Angelenos can more effectively practice the safe social distancing necessary during the outbreak.

* Relaxed enforcement of street sweeping restrictions in residential areas

* Relaxed enforcement around closed schools

* Moratorium on ticketing and towing for abandoned vehicles and oversize vehicle overnight parking fines

* Freeze on parking fine increases for the next 60 days

* Extended grace period for people dropping off or picking up groceries and goods

* Immediate extension on all deadlines for payment due until June 1

The relaxed enforcement will be in place until March 31, and is subject to extension. Enforcement will be maintained on operations that prioritize health, safety, and emergency access ‚Äî including colored curbs, street sweeping around encampments, peak-hour restrictions, and repaving and slurry operations. It will also continue at metered spaces to encourage parking turnover for businesses and restaurants relying on takeout and deliveries.

#[City of West Hollywood Parking Enforcement](https://www.weho.org/Home/Components/News/News/9190/23)

The City of West Hollywood has proclaimed the existence of a local emergency in response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health emergency. A Resolution with this proclamation was added to the City Council agenda as an Urgency Item and was approved by the City Council of the City of West Hollywood at its regular meeting on Monday, March 16, 2020. The proclamation enhances the City of West Hollywood‚Äôs ability to access emergency resources at the state and federal level to assist with its novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) response.

**Coronavirus medical information:**
#[Understanding Coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/)

**Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)** is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.

**[Common signs of this virus](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Kx8IBe-rxGDdezu3pq5jWm_szQ=/0x0:2616x1402/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2616x1402):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19782405/Coronavirus_Symptoms___WHO_joint_mission_2.png)**:

* respiratory symptoms
* fever
* cough
* shortness of breath
* breathing difficulties

Severe cases may result in:
* pneumonia
* severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
* kidney failure
* death.

**[Infection prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)**:

* Wash your hands regularly
* Covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing
* Thoroughly cooking meat and eggs
* Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. 
* Practice **social distancing** by standing at least 6-feet away from other people at all times when possible.

The mortality rate is unconfirmed but believed to be about 2-4%, with a higher likeliness of death in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. An unknown incubation period (where you are infected without necessarily showing symptoms, and are able to transmit the virus) has made tracking it difficult. It is anticipated that half of Californias will be infected at some point.
