I understand that you're only describing a time without property. But applying the topic to your information. Would it not be considered from the very start that neither nomadic nor sedentary life are ideal, as both result in solutions that then arise with problems?

""Life expectancy at birth in the pre-agricultural community was about twenty-six years,"" says Armelagos, ""but in the post-agricultural community it was nineteen years.

**Natural** **Habitat:** Common in broad-leaf hardwoods in the spring and late fall, especially cottonwoods, oaks, alders, maples, aspens, ash, beech, birch, elm, willows, and poplars. From an evolutionary point of view, this mushroom has been very successful, given its ability to saprophytize a broad range of tree species. 

**Cooking:** Stir fry in a light oil at high heat until golden brown and then cooked with other condiments.",1578012305,fcvxg5w

Of the approximately 1,700,000 interracial crimes of violence involving blacks and whites, 90 percent are committed by blacks against whites.
Blacks are therefore up to 250 times more likely to do criminal violence to whites than the reverse.
Black-on-white rape is 115 times more common than the reverse
4% of Americnas (black males 18-34) commit about HALF of all murders.

He sponsored a 2014 amendment to the [Alabama Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Constitution) banning ""foreign law"".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Allen_(politician)#cite_note-4)

In 2017, Allen sponsored a bill for the [Alabama Memorial Preservation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Memorial_Preservation_Act) to make it harder to remove [Confederate monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Confederate_monuments_and_memorials) in Alabama.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Allen_(politician)#cite_note-montgomerylymanhouseapproves-5)

C Spire was joined by Alabama state and local officials and Alabama Power today to announce a major expansion of broadband services that will bring high-speed Internet to large parts of metropolitan Birmingham, Shelby County and other parts of Alabama.

The privately held company has provided wireless, broadband and managed business and data services in Mississippi, other states and across the country for over 30 years and plans to deploy its ultra-fast, all-fiber Gigabit speed broadband internet access and related services to homes and businesses in Alabama beginning in 2020.

While weve had a presence in southern Alabama for decades and our Alabama headquarters are here in the Birmingham area, we plan to make our all-fiber broadband services available to homes and businesses across the state next year.

Last month, the Alabama Rural Broadband Coalition formally welcomed C Spire into its coalition, which is comprised of 30 organizations across the state focused on rural broadband expansion, ranging from agriculture and business to economic development, education and health care.

C Spire will contract for a portion of Alabama Powers fiber infrastructure to help support its offering of high-speed Internet in several communities in the metro Birmingham area and other parts of Alabama.",1578975220,fecj7k3

Roman examined the number of justifiable homicides—a killing deemed to have been carried out without malicious or criminal intent—between 1976 and 2018, and found that the likelihood of this ruling in cases in which men killed other men was ten per cent greater than when women killed men.

1126,BlaiseSanford,"You've missed the point, it seems to me. Low property taxes are not bad. The argument is that Alabama maintains very low property taxes and raises other taxes, e.g. sales or sin taxes, which disproportionately hit low-income residents. The state needs more revenue--I don't even think that's debatable--and by not raising those taxes that affect its wealthier residents, it shifts the burden unfairly to its poorer ones who lose much more of their income as a result.

More broadly, this tax scheme stymies economic growth. As Keynes pointed out, rich people save more out of each dollar than other people do, which in unequal societies can lead to a glut of saving and lower over-all demand. When poorer Alabamians spend such a large percentage of their income on sales or sin taxes--which as he points out include medication and groceries--they save less and drag down demand. With our weird tax code, we have no money to invest in infrastructure, education, etc.--i.e., those things that would invest in Alabamians and spur business and growth. As he says, all we would have to do is to edge towards the taxes imposed by our neighboring states--far from a Maryland, far from anything close to a progressive code--and we would have a necessary and substantial spike in revenue.",1579151678,feiziwe
1127,Risho96,"I'm not sure if we really need more tax revenue, though. Alabama already has generally good roads.  (https://www.google.com/amp/s/247wallst.com/infrastructure/2019/08/24/this-state-has-the-highest-quality-roads-in-america/amp/) (driving on them) 

Also, poor people do buy houses sometimes, especially if they weren't always poor. Lower property taxes benefit ALL tax brackets.

Besides, so what if people have to pay sales tax? Especially since the state sales tax is 4% compared to Tennessee's 7%. Tennessee also charges it on groceries. Tennessee also has no income tax, which favors the wealthy FAR more than a low, but still existent, property tax. Just looking at that, it seems like we're doing better than ""the neighbors."" Also, rich people DO tend to buy more expensive products, and used goods are pretty much never taxed. Part of the appeal of thrift shops, y'know? I've been poor, the taxes were annoying, but then, they still are.

1131,BlaiseSanford,"Fair points. And the major infrastructure projects--expanding Mobile port, the corridor to Memphis--are made possible by federal appropriations, secured in Washington by Senators Shelby and Jones.

The argument that we need more state tax revenue assumes that some share will go to investments that address our gravest socioeconomic problems (themselves impediments to economic growth). We are one of the poorest states; we have one of the lowest performing public educations systems; and our suboptimal healthcare system sees hospitals--particularly rural ones--closing at an alarming rate. I believe the state has an obligation to redress these trends, and the obvious truth is that the only way to find the cash for appropriate policy projects is through tax revenue.

Back to Archibald's thesis: We could easily raise more revenue--$1.5. billion, as his case of Mississippi shows--if we adjusted property taxes and did not rely so heavily on adjustments to sales and sins taxes. Rich people purchasing luxury items offers a tiny portion of revenue; we need a structural change that will actually bring in more money. And of course low property taxes benefit all brackets. But the fact is that if the state needs more revenue--to be sure, I am arguing that it does--it will raise substantially more by raising property taxes. And more generally, that will render the tax code more fair by not relying on a system that takes a huge percentage of poorer residents' income while taking only a tiny percentage of wealthy people's income.

Not that it would be easy, I acknowledge. The reason property taxes are kept low, as Archibald explains, is largely because the state constitution makes modifications to these taxes exceedingly difficult. And finally, I agree with you about waste: The State House would have to demonstrate it cut out waste before levying higher taxes.",1579157229,fej531t

As for the economic growth, we seem to be doing pretty well. The bureau of labor statistics reports (as of November) that Alabama has the tenth LOWEST unemployment rate in the US. Mississippi's number fifty, right between D.C. and Alaska, Georgia's number twenty, Florida's number fourteen, and Tennessee is number twenty. Twentieth was a four way tie. (https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm)

To be fair, that article/issue turns on the debate over expanding Medicaid. Still, these closings are attributed to lack of funding, and not to mismanagement. And the fundamental problem is the worrying number of uninsured Alabamians. It is yet another byproduct of the state's poverty. (The problem is not that we are ""not rich""; the poverty in some counties is so extreme that they lack proper sewage systems, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/12/12/570217635/the-u-n-looks-at-extreme-poverty-in-the-u-s-from-alabama-to-california), to offer just one example evidencing the phenomenon. Surely we can all agree that the state has an obligation to provide for sanitation.)

The unemployment numbers are encouraging. But to revert to, and underscore, the original argument: Working class people will give away an outsize portion of wages because the state chooses to tax its residents in a way that disadvantages them. By consequence, upward mobility is undercut for residents and the budget is undercut for the state and the services it provides. A vicious cycle.  
To clarify, neither Archibald's column nor myself are arguing that Alabama should imitate our neighbors; as you correctly point out, they offer no examples worth imitating. My earlier reference to neighboring states was intended to simply raise into sharper relief just how singular our tax code is, how even with a raise in property taxes we would still be well, well below anything that could fairly be described as a ""high tax.""

1186,Vyceron,"The state constitution needs to be re-written.  As mentioned below, it's the longest constitution in the world.  A constitutional convention should involve these points:

1. **Replace the current tax system based primarily on sales tax with one based on property and income tax.**  Yes, this will probably lead to fewer people retiring here or moving here due to lower taxes.  But, it's a more progressive taxation system than what we have now.  In the current system, a household making $200,000 a year with a $500,000 house has a smaller proportional tax burden than a household making $50,000 a year with a $125,000 house.
2. **County and city-level legislation does NOT need statewide voting.**  Why does Lowndes county have to vote on a sales tax proposal in Covington county?
3. **Allow a lottery.**  Alabama is literally surrounded now by states that have state-run lotteries.  Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and now even Mississippi have lotteries.  Last time I checked, the only states left without lotteries are Alabama, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, and Utah.  Nevada doesn't want competition for Las Vegas casinos, Alaska gives residents an oil stipend every year, Utah is as religious as Alabama, and I'm not sure about Hawaii.

Essentially, a CON program requires any person or entity wishing to provide a new type of health service (whether it be building a new hospital, expanding the services already offered, or even buying a new MRI machine) to show that there is a ""need"" for such service in the community. A totally independent agency will review the application and allow other interested/affected providers to oppose the request. The process usually takes months before any decision is made, and it can costs hundreds of thousands in legal fees. 

Simply put, [these laws are one of the main barriers to healthcare access.](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/corporate-welfare/certificate-need-laws) They favor existing providers, stifle competition, and limit the expansion of services.

 The community does need to step up and take a bigger role in education. Many students struggle and having some sort of support system helps them succeed. The education system needs a big overhaul, and even if it happened now we won’t see results for years. We need to hurry up and do it so the next generation can do better.

This is the answer. But they are stubborn to change because Alabamians want their ""traditional values"" taken into account literally before anything else.

First, I'd like to apologize for the wording of the article, as your state was being used as a pejorative. In the Canadian context when something is 'American' style it generally seen as a negative, and when certain states like 'Alabama' or 'Arkansas' are used, doubly-so. Most Canadians probably don't know too much about US geography and demographics (though probably a little bit more than US knowledge about Canada) but even those that don't know that Alabama isn't considered to be a high-ranking state.

As for Ford, well he probably couldn't care less about the ultimate educational outcome. It's all about money. That and probably sticking it to teachers, as a good chunk of his base generally don't like teachers or unions - so they really don't like teacher unions.

To be fair to Ford and his government, the previous Liberal government did leave a sizeable deficit (that, however, [they claimed to be double the size](https://globalnews.ca/news/6047027/ontario-deficit-financial-accountability-officer-report/)) and his main rationale, whether it be [interfering with municipal politics](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-election-timeline-1.4824060), [rolling back environmental protections](https://thenarwhal.ca/doug-ford-is-clear-cutting-ontarios-environmental-laws/) or [cancelling almost completed wind farms](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-green-energy-wind-turbines-cancelled-230-million-1.5364815), has always been made with that goal in mind. That said, it hasn't worked well. He and his party (Progressive Conservatives or 'PCs') have actually done a lot of cutting and have also [increased the deficit at the same time](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-s-deficit-for-2019-2020-falls-to-9-billion-ford-government-cuts-small-business-tax-1.4672295). It will be interesting if he can get a 'win' here, but considering I have a kid in school, I really hope he doesn't. All the cutting - and his other policy decisions - has not made him or his party popular - they've already dropped 11% since their election in 2018, and are actually trailing the Liberals by 4%, even though that party hasn't even elected a new leader yet. 

(The reason I'm in the Alabama sub is that is joined back during the 2018 midterm elections to see what Alabamians thought about Doug Jones/Roy Moore....and I just never un-subbed.

They never look at the effects, how addictive, or it even safe ways to take the drug in general.

In all honestly drugs are most useful in the short term to actually combat pain or say help someone with ADD or to get through a day.  Also  doctors are legal drugs dealers so let’s put that on the table and they often have to discard patients due to current run government programs.

Now I won’t say doctors or even psychiatrists are evil because I know dozens of both groups and some will help you every step of the way but even they argue there are bad doctors out there like bad cops or bad Uber drivers. Many have differing opinions on these issues and have shown me written scientific articles and studies. I’ll link their personal studies later today if you still have questions. (I’m traveling for a funeral today). There are hundreds to dozens of studies that link both drugs to having bad long-term use and in my opinion they should never be used to treat long term problems but more like a therapeutic gateway to help people out in the short term. Like someone who is depressed shouldn’t take Prozac for an extended period of time or else they turn into a shell of human without it. Now if someone is very suicidal Prozac wouldn’t be a bad option to help that person in the short term.

1513,syntiro,"[Here's](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-information/2020) some good information about the upcoming elections for 2020.

The primaries will be held on **Tuesday, March 3, 2020**. Deadlines to register to vote in the primaries are (the dates are the last day you can successfully register by the mentioned method):
* **Friday, February 14** - hand delivered registration
* **Saturday, February 15** - postmarked (mail-in) registration
* **Monday, February 17** - online registration

For **absentee ballots**, you have until **Thursday, February 27** to apply for one. And then you have until **Monday, March 2** (the day before the in-person election) to hand-deliver or postmark your absentee ballot.

If you aren't registered, get registered! If you've moved to a new address recently, double-check your registration, and make sure you to update it!

If you don't get registered in time for the primary, you can still vote in the primary runoffs happening on March 31, as long as you register according to those deadlines (which are later than the ones for the initial primary). Even if you don't vote in the initial primary election (which you should!), you are still allowed to vote in any runoffs there may be, as long as you are registered in time for those (March 16 is the general cutoff to be registered).",1579270163,femus6b

I tried googling it and one article I read (that was very obviously written by either a liberal or a conservative even) also mentioned differences on views on race (ie a persons race is insignificant) and free speech (re: universities and institutions banning “hate speech”). Can you expand on that?,1579293991,feo1riy
1577,AceD3sign3r,"Well, liberals (Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, etc.) aren't determined by their stance on race. It's an economic and social division. Race itself is a construct (it's not a real phenomenon). The concept was created by racists in order to justify the mistreatment of minorities. Subdividing society by skin tone is as stupid as dividing based on hair or eye color. The genes involved are equally insignificant. 

Materialists on the Left analyze material conditions- the position minorities find themselves in is a consequence of history. The ancestors of modern day African Americans were slaves. Most wealth is inherited, so they immediately got the short stick. Pair that with societal bigotry, and it's apparent that the conditions of many minority communities lies in history, not melanin, not some inherent quality that racists would have you believe. Liberals don't tend to acknowledge materialist analysis, regardless whether or not they want to treat the issue or exacerbate it. 

On the issue of free speech- it's a case by case basis. Freedom of speech isn't freedom from consequences. Freedom of speech entitles you to be able to say what you like, barring inciting violence, but it doesn't guarantee you won't be fired if, for instance, you say ""Hitler was right!"" You won't be thrown in jail, but you can be fired. This is really a legal issue, not one that should fall to party lines.

All of my education has been completed under the Alabama education system. K-12 was completed in north Alabama, 2 year associates completed in north alabama, and 4 year engineering degree from the university of Alabama. 

 Traditional teaching methods in the classroom is my preferred method of learning, and I prefer female teachers/professors .Overall, I gain more information with a teacher nearby to answer questions, but I believe this is mostly a crutch because I don’t have to ask questions to get some benefit. 

Online learning is fantastic for those that have focus, motivation, and people/subjects that require repetition. 
Example: Math. Learning basic methods and processes in the classroom (or online video) and then having online learning programs for you to repeat until you can do this mathematical process with ease.
Example 2: History. After reading the chapter in question: repeatable 25 question quiz with 100 question base.
These online methods taught me in community college more than the subject on hand. They taught me the requirements to learn, how to learn, how to study, and how to ensure I’m ready for a test.

If someone wants to have better educational opportunities, they do some form of dual enrollment (go to highschool and college) or they just swap schools.

I take advanced courses in these subjects that you cannot get at other schools. The kids in the art portion spend their specialty period learning from artists in their craft) and a bunch of private schools.

Clearly Alabama has a rough history when it comes to race. The issue of Slavery, Jim Crowe, hell MLK’s famous march against institutionalized oppression happened in Selma. Having a holiday for a military leader who fought for the Confederacy, a government whose secession was for the intended purpose of preserving slavery: on the same day as Martin Luther King Day is without a doubt inappropriate. 

**That being said**, people are very quick to assert assumptions any time a discussion about the Civil War  comes up, particularly when it comes to Robert E. Lee.

Living in 2020 with the issue of slavery being 150 in the past, most people assume that if they were born in that time then obviously they would be against slavery. And why shouldn’t they think that? After all, there is such a moral disgust against it in the 21st century. It is an understandable position to hold. However, hindsight is 20/20. Considering  that the abolition movement in the US was a [minority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States) in the political sphere, it is more than probable if you were born in the South during that time, you would not support emancipation. 

Robert E. Lee as an individual was against the institution of slavery. He also happened to own slaves. This seems to be a gross example of hypocrisy, does it not? However, consider this: black slaves that were born under the yoke were not educated, even more so considering that it was illegal for a white man or woman to teach a slave how to read. Black slaves, for the majority, had no valuable trade skills, aside from those pertaining to agriculture. After the war, rather than migrating elsewhere, most slaves continued to farm as they had done before, working for poverty wages. To emancipate his slaves would have meant the end of his livelihood and the destitution of his family as well as the likely starvation of his slaves ( Lees father Light Horse Harry gambled his fortune away and left his son and wife penniless when he died. ) You might would say, “Lee should have freed his slaves nonetheless because that would be the right thing to do.” However, statistically speaking, how many are willing to take great risk to themselves or their families for the sake of principles? Do principles keep you warm at night In the freezing cold? Do principles keep the terrible pains of hunger at bay? No. Does this change the fact that Lee owning slaves was morally wrong? No.

The point is, like us, Lee was a product of the times that he lived in. Cultural norms and societal pressures are an insurmountable force to be reckoned with and it takes an individual of incredible will and internal character to overcome them. Ask yourself this: 100’s years from now, how will society view us? Will they look at us with disgust and distain? Will they hold our morals in contempt? Will they attempt to try to understand why we held the positions we did, or will they dismiss us without a second thought?

 Was Lee a racist? Yes. Was he a monster? No. He was human. And at the very least, he deserves fair understanding, not morally upright condemnation.",1579411496,fewiyxg

&gt;Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.

The CSA Constitution has provisions specifically designed to keep blacks enslaved in perpetuity:

&gt;No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.

&gt;The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.

&gt;The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several states; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory, the institution of negro slavery as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress, and by the territorial government: and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories, shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the Confederate states.


The military officers and soldiers I will agree on, ( and although it must be said that there was dissent about fighting a “rich mans war,”) many many fought because they felt that they had a higher duty to their state. To many that is inconceivable, but one must understand that in those times there wasn’t a sense of national shared identity like there is today. There was still a sense of pride in being an American, but duty and loyalty was to Virginia first and the nation second, or whatever state you happened to live in at the time.

Today one can go from Mobile to Detroit in 18 hours by a gasoline powered car. In those times a journey like that would take months by horse and buggy. Trains existed at the time yes and were becoming more widespread, but people were no where near connected like they are today. Most people were born lived and died not traveling more than 100 miles from their home town. Washington D. C. was a place people knew about but only heard in conversation or the newspapers. A tobacco farmer in South Carolina had more in common with the people around him than he did a factory worker in New York. And so yes, when war broke out, many felt they were defending their homeland against a foreign aggressor and they fought bravely and died in the thousands for that belief.

But even saying that, we cannot lose sight of the truth. Our leaders betrayed us. They led us astray because defending the status quo and letting thousands of young men get slaughtered and do the slaughtering of their own countrymen was preferable to reforming a society built on the whip scarred  backs of slaves.

Lieutenant General James Longstreet : Guess so.

General Robert E. Lee : Let us not think about that now. The issue is in God's hands. We can only do our duty. General, soldiering has one great trap: to be a good solider you must love the army. To be a good commander, you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love. We do not fear our own death you and I.. But there comes a time.....We are never quite prepared for so many to die. Oh, we do expect the occasional empty chair. A salute to fallen comrades. But this war goes on and on and the men die and the price gets ever higher. We are prepared to loose some of us, but we are never prepared to loose all of us. And there is the great trap General.

1831,TheByzantineEmperor,"&gt;That part of the story is well-known. What makes Smith’s essay important is the way he provides additional, critical background to this horrible event, and reveals both its extent across the corps and divisions of Lee’s army, as well as the acquiescence to it, up and down the chain of command. The seizures were not, as is sometimes suggested, the result of individual soldiers or rouge troops acting on their own initiative, in defiance of their orders. The perpetrators were not, to use a more recent cliché, “a few bad apples.” The seizure of free Blacks and escaped slaves by the Army of Northern Virginia was widespread, systematic, and countenanced by officers up to the highest levels of command. This event, and others on a much smaller scale, were so much part of the army’s operation that Smith argues they can legitimately be considered a part of the army’s operational objective. Smith is blunt in his terminology for these activities; he calls them “slave raids.”

1842,JennJayBee,"All of it is true, actually. I'm a homeschool parent who had tried the online public schools.

E: I should also add that one of my daughter's friends also uses the online option. She has seizures that make it harder to physically attend. For her, it's a good option.

Going into further detail...

The online public school options allow children to have access to the regular public school curriculum. All materials are paid for by taxes. Kids sign in for a certain amount of time (sometimes at a set time, depending on course) and habe work that they do and turn in. Parents and kids meet with teachers a certain number of times per year. All of this is dictated by which program you use.

There is in fact a LOT of work that accompanied the program– much of which we found completely unnecessary, and it took us hours to complete. It was in fact more than what my daughter had been doing when I pulled her from public school in fourth grade. Now before you say ""but class work is added to homework"" bear this in mind... My daughter is autistic. Her teachers couldn't be arsed to explain her class work instructions to her, so all of that had been sent home with her, too. It's why we pulled her. So yes, I'm comparing total class time work and homework to what was provided in the online public school work.

And yes, much of what is in public school is filler work designed to help along kids that might be struggling with a concept. You cannot simply move on once you've grasped a concept. These curricula are designed to move a group of students at the same speeds. If you're able to move ahead, you can't do so.

And no, you don't have the freedom to change up the schedule as much as you'd like.

Now, this is assuming you use the online public school option and do not instead buy the curriculum for personal use in homeschool. Because those are both available options, and you get different experiences with them when you do that. I know homeschool parents who use these programs, but not as an online public school. They skip the work they don't need to do and set their own schedules.

Comparatively, I was able to switch to Acellus (also an online private school but available for homeschool use) as a homeschool resource and cover more in about 4 hours than we were covering in 8. I can also set our schedule as needed. We do year round, three weeks on and one week off. I try to cover content in four days and use Friday as a wild card to use if needed. It works well. I have a now 8th grader who can do her own work without needing much extra help, can speak three languages, and is taking advanced math and coding courses. I would not be able to fit those things in or move ahead with the online public school options.",1579458924,fezm8tt

Firstly, consider that Alabama is ranked near last in the US in terms of quality public education. We're a poor example to use in that regard.

E-learning is good to have as an option. We use them as part of my homeschool curriculum, BUT they have their limits. You have to find the right course fit for the individual, same as you would with any class.

As a requirement, I'd say it's not a great idea. Some kids might not have adequate access to broadband in more rural areas.

Mostly, I've found it as an excuse to hire fewer teachers. They're great if you want to offer more options and only a few students might be interested in a particular course, or if someone is looking for flexibility, but for those who do better in a more traditional environment and who lack the resources to be able to access these classes, making it mandatory is going to cause issues.",1579489346,ff1yug5

2007,Ateo,"I disagree (kinda) - I want consistently good food.  If my interaction with someone at the drive through doesn't include ""My pleasure"" - I'm not that heartbroken.   Now I do want the order to be correct as well, so that would fall under customer service, I guess.

[This article](https://thehustle.co/why-it-only-costs-10k-to-own-a-chick-fil-a-franchise/) I stumbled across today explains a lot about the consistency you get in Chik-Fil-A compared to other fast food places.  You need more than just money to run a Chik-Fil-A.  I would think with the razor thin margins the stores run on - why are they are not managed better?

2180,Left-of-Alabama,"I am familiar with automobile sub plants in Alabama. 

They are often in rural areas and have low pay and poor benefits. 

Many full time manufacturing jobs in the Montgomery area hire at $7.50 to $8.50 per hour for full time work often 10 to 12 hour shifts.

I’ve been through plants in Luverne, Greenville, Evergreen and Montgomery that supply Hyundai. It’s an absolute joke what people are expected to do for such ridiculous pay. It’s not as if the people in these communities have many options so yea they can pay as little as they want. In the years I worked in the area wages were stagnant and benefits laughable.

When Hyundai expands and they say there is going to be 1,500 new jobs just remember that like 100-200 will be positions with a livable wage at Hyundai and the rest will be these horrid supplier jobs. The main Hyundai facility itself is full of temporary, low wage employees as well though. They sell a dream of getting hired on that rarely happens.",1579788894,ffc15hp
2181,Left-of-Alabama,"Also remember that Hyundai, Toyota and others come to places like Alabama and Mississippi because they can pay such low wages and workers rights and the threat to unionize are all but nonexistent. Alabama workers are also extremely demoralized and they have no idea how to organize or push for higher wages and better benefits. 

They leave South Korea and Japan where wages, standards of living are higher to come to Alabama. Mind you many Koreans I have worked with are union members in their home country and if they need medical care fly home to get care and come back.",1579789540,ffc20gh

2196,decaf_rs,I will have to mostly agree with you there. Capital is needed to make workers more efficient and increase real wages. Acquiring capital takes time and effort and usually doesn't happen overnight. I don't necessarily agree on labor organization being better for workers in the long run.

During the Russian Civil War, the Soviet government allowed a variety of small arms and bladed weapons. Afterwards, the government made immediate alternations for those to whom it did not rely. The government had made it a point to ""arm the working people"" in the Declaration of the Rights of Working and Exploited People in January 1918. The December decree of the CPC of 1918, ""On the surrender of weapons"", ordered people to surrender any firearms, swords, bayonets and bombs, regardless of the degree of serviceability.

**Gun control in China**

The People's Republic of China has one of the strictest gun control regulations in the world.  Generally, private citizens are not allowed to possess firearms.

Conservatives and liberals do not watch the same TV shows, they don’t listen to the same music, watch and read the same news and it is very concerning. They don’t live in the same reality. This isn’t always the case of course but for the most part it. 

This decisive and alienating politics is especially effective in Alabama in my opinion.

They latch on to single issues like abortion or gun rights and vote straight Republican because that is an identity that they’ve attached themselves to. This reactionary conservatism, white grievance, identity politics is ingrained in the culture of Alabama. It is in the churches, our media (hello talk radio and yellow hammer), the private schools and city, county and state governments. It’s generational in families as well. It’s so much an identity more so than anything actually political. It this rebellious Alabama culture that we oppose anything perceived as elitist, coastal or liberal. 

Extremely tribal. Maybe it goes all the way back to the original English, Scottish and Irish settlers to this region. Extremely untrusting, very clannish. 

The rise in reactionary conservatism in the late 60’s through the 70’s and 80’s plays a role. A lot of that was based around race and pushed back against desegregation. Probably the southern strategy as well playing into the generational aspect of it.",1580140204,ffqowp7

I just think he is a decade too early though. Not for me but the general public. Americans typically need something terrible to happen before they will mobilize politically. 

Everything he is saying has some truth to it. People might not agree or be ready for his solutions but in my opinion there will come a time when he will be proven correct.

2646,RealBACONATOR2,"If you read about how new interstates were built in cities in the 50s-60s, yes, their paths were often racially motivated. Take for example I-94 that runs through the middle of Minneapolis. At it's construction there were two routes proposed, one through a disused industrial park following the existing railway line, or one through the middle of the black middle class neighborhood ""Old Rondo"". I-94 was built through the neighborhood, demolishing the main street of this district.

[Robert Moses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses) led much of this planning, and was a leading activist for building interstates through the hearts of cities and getting people to live in the suburbs. 

His career basically ended when he tried to build an interstate through Grenwich village and Little Italy in NYC, demolishing blocks and blocks of established neighborhoods for a largely unnecessary highway. The effort failed, and NYC still has these cultural touchstones.

The article is trying to bring up this history, but it's unclear whether this same story is actually true for Birmingham or not. But other cities like New Orleans saw some neighborhoods come back and flourish after demolishing some raised highway sections.

Plenty of people are bitching that they can't afford WDW tickets, but that didn't decrease demand. Why? Because WDW is a fun vacation. People want to go. The parks stay packed, and rides maintain ridiculous wait times, but people keep going back. Demand is just fine. 

It also seems to be working well for skilled laborers. They're not having trouble finding a buyer for their product (their labor). Alabama employers are finding them hard to obtain because they're not willing to pay a fair price for that product. The law of supply and demand wins again.

2830,TragicWorld,Except for two weeks out of the year that we would call spring and fall it's either cold (southern cold.... like 30F) or so hot that the instant you walk outside you start sweating. People are nice pretty much everywhere. If you breakdown in a parking lot or on a local road 6 or 7 people will stop to ask if they can help. Food is fried... all of it. We like it that way. We are not heavily populated. 4 million at last check with around half in about 4 cities. Rest are spread out. Birmingham is nice. We are doing a lot better in crime somewhere around 100 people were murdered in bham which is down. I grew up in Sylacauga (the only place where a meteor has hit a human and it has been recorded) which is close to Talladega which is a HUGE Nascar track. College football is huge here. Probably the only place you'll see someone who didn't go to college wearing college gear. NFL is irrelevant here. Now for the elephant in the room. Racism is slightly worse than the rest of the nation but overblown. If you watch the news you would think we all have white hoods in our closet. I think it's like that because we have a awful history with it. Cost of living drags the ground. $400 a month utilities usually included for the cheapest. Beach is close (4-5 hours from bham) mountains are even closer. Gambling is illegal except on native reservations. Sex toys are illegal. Yes no shit. You can not buy a sex toy for the intention of pleasuring yourself. They still sell them under a scientific exemption. You literally have to sign something saying you will use it for scientific research. Guns are everywhere. In my opinion that's a good thing but for some it might not be. We are pretty lax on gun control. We are a shall issue state which means if you pass the requirements for a CCW the state has to give it to you. Carrying a loaded handgun in your car without a permit will result in a felony if caught. Politics here suck. We have a abortion ban which is wrong because the supreme court made their mind up for the nation decades ago. Taxes are low. Sales tax is high I believe. Roads are good if they are regularly traveled. Every truck is jacked up to 6ft tall. Smoking is common but on it's way out in favor of vaping. Dipping is very common. I love my home. I probably wont ever move away from it. People who move away end up coming back more often than not anyway.,1580364640,ffz5ghk

We wear flip flops year round and pull out the hoodies, tall boots, scarves, and pumpkin spice everything, if the temperature drops below 65 degrees or the calendar says it's Fall. Fall festivals are huge here, as well as Spring festivals, Shrimp festivals along the coast, and a parade for every holiday under the sun. Mardi Gras is huge in Mobile, because you know that we were the first to celebrate the holiday, not New Orleans. And I have been know to wear shorts to our family Christmas gathering because it is so hot outside. Not just college football is huge here, high school football has every small town stadium lit up on Friday nights and you can hear the announcers from the football field as you sit on your front porch during the game if you don't attend. Every young girl dreams of being a cheerleader to cheer her home town team to the state championship. Children chase fireflies and katydids (cicadas) sing you to sleep on warm summer nights. They race everything here from cars, motorcycles, buses, and go carts to lawn mowers. Most men fish and/or hunt everything from deer to pigs to squirrels. Schools close early one day during the week that the local fair is in town to allow the children to attend and if there is 1/2"" of snow then the schools are closed. We have a LOT of tornadoes and school will close early and send the children home if they feel there will be a chance of a severe storm. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is played at every event that ever happens in the state and we have the band Alabama that will sing ""My Home's in Alabama"" on every jukebox, in every Waffle House, across the state. Not to mention their Christmas song ""Christmas in Dixie."" I leave my door open if I have to run out for a while and my neighbors will keep an eye on my house while I'm gone.

It's not like Nevada or Arizona 100 degrees either; it feels like a rain forest around here during summertime.  A ""cold"" day in January or February is when the high temp is 30 degrees and the low is 15.  Those cold days only happen during a small window.

\- The job situation depends on your career field.  I personally work in IT, and the job market here is...meh.  Huntsville AL is booming, due to the federal presence there.  Birmingham is good too.  Outside of those two cities, it can be difficult to find certain tech jobs.  A LOT of Alabamians end up leaving the state for Atlanta, Nashville, or other major Southern cities.  I won't comment on other career fields due to lack of knowledge.

\- I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but... Alabama ranks near the bottom in many categories.  Poverty rate, mortality rate, public official corruption, education level, violent crime rate,  obesity rate, to name a few.  The citizens of this state are relatively poor, overweight and unhealthy, uneducated, and die young.  It's the statistical truth.  I don't claim to know what the source cause of these stats are, but I think that Alabamians should acknowledge these statistics so that we can all start working towards making Alabama a better state.",1580387049,ffzni17

Summer cranks up in May and end sometime in October. Sometimes its rainy and 100% humid, sometimes we end up in a drought. Sometimes its both. 

Spring time is a weird mix of cold snaps, actual comfortable weather, severe weather outbreaks, all topped off with a layer of yellow sneezing tree jizz known as pollen. It starts sometime in March usually.

Fall is the 2-3 weeks of nice weather between the never ending summer and the first cold snap of winter. The trees become colorful, but it's short lived.

Winters are all mild. We tend to have the occasional snow or ice storm threat that may or may not happen. Either way we wont know until it happens because our meteorologist can't predict snow accurately to save their lives. It usually shuts the state down because we don't have the means of treating roads. Bridges ice over; people wreck and get stranded (want a good example? we had ""snowmageddon"" back in 2014 and it quasifucked central Alabama).

&amp;#x200B;

I think there's definitely a disconnect where the Alabama in fiction is buffered from the Alabama of today (or of the time written about) by a combination of nostalgia &amp; romanticism. Obviously most autobiographical fiction has some of that, but in Alabama it's amplified - both by all of the Lost Cause narratives floating around and also by the way most Alabama stories are told by people who've since left Alabama - John Green to Indiana, Fannie Flagg to California - and who have a stake in making Alabama into something semi-mystical when really, it's not.

Honestly, I think the short story **The Man Who Was Almost a Man** by Richard Wright captures Alabama better than most of the classic novels.

You can get one either in-person or by [mailing an application](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/LETTER%20SIZE%20Absentee%20Application%207.23.2019.pdf) (sorry, no online option) to your county's [Absentee Election Manager](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/city-county-lookup/absentee-election-manager). 

You have until 5 days before the election to request the Absentee ballot application (so for the primaries, you have until end of day on February 27th).

Once your absentee ballot application is approved (if you apply in person, you'll get it right then and there; if you apply by mail, you'll receive it by mail), your ballot will come with 3 envelopes. Fill out your ballot, follow the instructions on how to seal it properly. There's an affidavit that you'll need to either have notarized, or have 2 people you know sign as witnesses (no notary requirement for either of these 2 people if you go this route). 

Then you have until March 2 (the day before the actual primary) to either hand-deliver your sealed ballot to your Absentee Election Manager, or postmark. If you mail it, there's a stipulation it needs to arrive to the Absentee Election Manager no later than 12pm on Election Day (March 3) - if you end up mailing it back, give yourself at least a couple extra days to meet this requirement (I'd postmark it by Wednesday the 26th just to be safe).

Sounds like a lot, but the instructions on the absentee ballot is pretty clear on how to do it. I've voted absentee a few times, and never had any issues with it. 

All this info can be found [on the Secretary of State's website](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/absentee-voting) if you need to refer back to it.

&gt;I’ve always thought that going to where the crime is reported by victims, looking for people that match the description of the perpetrator as provided by victims, and then looking to see if they are kids on the street – because almost all murders are young minority males killing young minority males. It’s like 90 percent. Take out domestic violence, after that there’s nothing left. [Gesturing at staffer again.] Amanda has no chance of getting killed in any meaningful sense. She can take the subway every day, she can walk in every neighborhood. If she got killed, it’s gotta be somebody she knows, or she was dealing, or buying with a lot of cash, or something like that.

&gt;So you go to those places where the crimes are reported, you look for people that look like the description, and then you use good police work. Is there any reason to stop them? The courts say if you act furtively, or there’s a bulge in their pocket or something like that, you stop ’em. And what happens is the kids learn, “I don’t want to carry a gun.”

**Contribution Amounts - AL**
Rank|Candidate|Amount Received
1|Byrne|$3,606,353.83
2|Tuberville|$1,542,322.29
3|Jones|$572,946.27
4|Sessions|$159.891.15

**Contribution Amounts - Out of State**
Rank|Candidate|Amount Received
1|Jones|$6,132,995.04
2|Byrne|$696,608.00
3|Sessions|$200,150.00
4|Tuberville|$66,184.45

**Individual Contributors - AL**
Rank|Candidate|Number of Contributors
1|Jones|1686
2|Byrne|1018
3|Tuberville|562
4|Sessions|112

**Individual Contributors - Out of State**
Rank|Candidate|Number of Contributors
1|Jones|22,270
2|Byrne|342
3|Tuberville|143
4|Sessions|137

Summary:
Most of Jones' and Sessions' money comes from out-of-state contributors. Byrne and Tuberville rely more on donations from Alabama residents. Jones still receives the most individual support from Alabama residents, receiving money from over 600 more residents than Byrne. This means that Jones' in-state supports are giving smaller donations than Byrne's in-state supports. Could point to support for Jones from the lower economic class with Byrne getting more support from wealthier individuals. 

All numbers pulled from the FEC website since that start of 2019 (placing Sessions at a major disadvantage since the other 3 have had longer to campaign).",1580830300,fgit2wv

Well, let's review your comments here, shall we?

&gt; Lets just remember that an officer was shot

&gt;If this helped apprehend someone who harmed an officer

&gt;I will gladly be woken up anytime an officer in our state is shot on the off chance I may be able to help in catching the offender

&gt;It was 45 seconds of your life, but meanwhile the officer's life will never be the same

&gt;So you had a bad night of sleep and some others had a rough night as well. This officer may die doing his job

&gt;This officer may die all because they were doing their job, so they deserve to wake up the state and have an escort to have the best chance of surviving this

&gt;This man killed an officer

&gt;With that attitude I am willing to bet there are some vast differences between you and this officer

&gt;These officers go to work to do a dangerous job

&gt;They are just people, but deserve more when they are killed doing their job.

3916,Fullofcrepe,"Jesus Christ. You should’ve listened to what I said and tried reading the constitution instead of throwing on caps lock like the dense twat you are. 

So here’s a free lesson that I’m sure will go right over your below-average head: 

Article 1, Section 2, Clause 5 says “The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and *shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.”*

Tell me how the Senate gets to decide impeachment when the House has the sole power of impeachment? Please explain it. I know it hurts to use logic, but try. You’re arguing that the Senate has the power to decide whether a president has been impeached, but the Senate doesn’t get to decide fuck all about impeachment. All they get to do is hold the trial of impeachment once a president has been impeached. It says it right there on the fucking page, you daft twat. An acquittal, even one based on a disagreement with the House over what *should* have been “impeachable” doesn’t somehow confer the power to decide impeachment on the Senate or give them the power to reverse impeachment. The House gets to vote to impeach, the Senate has to hold a trial. No amount of hissy fits from an asinine embarrassment such as yourself is going to change that.",1581022429,fgqe4im

If you want to be near the ocean and have cheaper prices, I'd recommend Dothan. When I lived there I had a 2 bedroom apartment for under $600 a month. Of course, that was a few years ago. Also, Dothan isn't really liberal either. Nobody will be chasing you down due to your political leanings, but religion will be a central theme to everything. I actually didn't realize how common it was until I moved to Birmingham and went a week without someone bringing Jesus into a conversation. 

I've lived here most of my life, and I'm conservative, but I know what to expect. Alabama can be an acquired taste, or you just get used to it. If you're vegan/vegetarian then you'll be better off near Birmingham since they have more options, but it's also a city, and that comes with city problems. IDK what your current situation is like, but I'd definitely recommend an extended visit before moving. But, if you're really into the hippy lifestyle, I'd really recommend Asheville, NC.

Huntsville is generally considered to be one of the most ""progressive"" cities in Alabama.

For many reasons my wife and I are acutely aware that we can not make this a permanent home.  Cost of living and weather aren't good enough to keep us here. 

That said, I understand the appeal, my wife's job here (web dev) pays more than double what we were making with combined income in Colorado. And our apartment is 1/2 the price we paid in Denver. 

But I can't find a job. I'm a former automotive service manager. Working in auto shops around Huntsville has shown me a serious dichotomy between those with a college degree and those without. (Makes me feel like an asshole to think/say this)

Bernie seems to have a decent following in Birmingham, though I personally prefer Buttigieg and Yang.

Huntsville and Birmingham might be good fits, culturally speaking, with Birmingham potentially being the best fit. The metro area is a lot bigger and includes several more rural areas, even outside of Jefferson County. I just moved from Argo to Springville, and while it's more rural, Argo does offer affordable housing, close proximity to Trussville and Springville shopping/dining, plenty of land to garden/farm, and a bit terrible commute to Birmingham.

You also mentioned food service, and Birmingham is a great location in that regard. We have award winning restaurants which could provide some good opportunities for up and coming chefs. There are also some upper middle to wealthy suburbs which offer opportunities for house cleaning and personal chef work.

4004,Wanderer-2-somewhere,"I personally really agree with the people suggesting Huntsville, Birmingham, or Dothan.

Don’t have much experience being in Dothan, but I’ve heard a lot of good things about it from friends who have lived there.

Huntsville’s probably on the more liberal side in comparison to the other places that have been suggested, at least in part, I think, because there’s a lot of cool stuff there that attracts people from all over the place, like the University of Alabama at Huntsville. Also, if you like stuff related to NASA, Huntsville’s a good place for that, too, since it’s home to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, as well as a whole bunch of places focused on engineering and history.

For Birmingham, it kinda depends on if you’re looking more into the city proper, or the surrounding suburbs there. Recently, I’ve really noticed a trend towards more liberal and progressive ideas among a lot of the suburbs, and it’s a lot more diverse than a lot of people seem to expect of Alabama. Plus, there’s also some pretty nice places to live there that probably won’t be *too* hard on the pocket, and much of it is a generally safe community too.

Also, if you’re interested in other more natural sites in the state I found a [list](https://www.al.com/living/2017/06/alabamas_most_beautiful_places.html) of some great places across the state.

Winter here is so peachy in comparison to up North. A few years ago, we went to spend Christmas with our families in NH, and boy we were miserable! A few blizzards, subzero temperatures... We do not miss that at all. In Alabama, we've gotten pretty used to the convenience of just being able to get up, get in the car, and go to work. No worries about clearing off snow or shoveling driveways. Occasionally there is frost on our windshields, but no big deal. Most of the time during the winter, the temperature  hovers from 35-55 degrees. 

Spring and Fall are pretty nice, my favorite seasons here, but they are tornado seasons.

I think your responses are indicating much more about your outlook than mine. I never once said anything about being concerned about ""rednecks"". I was asking a question about how well we would be accepted specifically because I have been told repeatedly that people in Alabama (and other southern states) are intolerant of people who are not politically/socially conservative &amp; Christian. 

My family is from Florida, went down there in the 1800s in a mule drawn wagon. We are all fishermen, hunters, outdoorsmen, farmers, blue collar workers- the proverbial ""crackers"" &amp; viewed as ""rednecks"" by most of the world. We just think of ourselves as ""people"", just like we think of other humans. Do you think if we really cared about politics/culture and believed the garbage people say about Alabama, we'd be considering moving to a state widely viewed in our country as being woefully backwards?

As Senator Melson said, the state should go ahead and get started now *before* the inevitable federal legalization comes, that way we don't end up with a massive unregulated market on our hands like when hemp was legalized and unregulated CBD products started cropping up all over the state.

They have had plenty of doctors such as Dr. Alan Shackelford, a physician from Colorado who have come in to talk to the Alabama Cannabis Commission and laid out that this is a legitimate medicine that has been used to treat patients successfully [here](https://www.al.com/news/2019/11/alabama-medical-cannabis-group-begins-work-on-bill.html) is an article about when that happened. The cannabis study commission applauded him when he made his presentations and laughed at some of those who made presentations in opposition to medical cannabis, if that's worth anything.

 I think the tide is finally starting to shift as there has been a constant flow of mostly positive information coming from legal states and a wave of legalization that's been sweeping the US for almost a decade straight now with no signs of the sky falling, and I think a lot of East coast states are going to get with the program, if not the federal government first. The reason I say that is because with half of the US with acces to medical, Canada being fully legal, and Mexico about to legalize as well there would be a MASSIVE public health crisis if this nearly global market were to stay illegal for a large swathe of the country, meaning it would remain unregulated and potentially harmful, and I doubt the US government is going to allow that to happen, it's just a matter of time.",1581403603,fhabop6

4400,Ajlee209,"While we both agree we should not have taxes on groceries, it seems we have different reasons. I'm not sure why you think it's not right but for me, its because grocery taxes hurt the poor more than others. 

A tax on GROCERIES - lets make sure we differentiate between groceries and prepared food - is regressive in nature. While everyone pays the same flat 10% (depending on your county) it disproportionally affects poorer people. You and I likely eat around the same amount of food, right? Let's say you make 200k and I make 50k a year. I spend $125 a week, $500 a month on groceries.  Because you're a big earner, you spend double that. You buy organic, you buy some nice prime steaks every now and again, etc. So that's $250 a week and $1000 a month. With those numbers, I am paying 1.2% of my salary on grocery taxes. You, however, even though you spend twice as much as I do, only spend .06% of your salary on groceries. That's why people say its a tax on the poor. 

On to property taxes - Personally, I think high property taxes are not the best way to increase revenue because we all have to have a place to live right? Similar to we all have to buy groceries. However, if we are going to tax it, it makes more sense to have that be a higher rate than groceries because your house value is not dependent on your survivability - food is.  You could get away with having a $200k house in Gardendale if you wanted to. You don't HAVE to have a $750k house in Vestavia.  But at the end of the day, you still gotta eat.",1581454825,fhc2ebi

Nothing prevents an 18 year old from registering to vote. It’s just easier if everyone is automatically registered. Basically you just automatically register anyone who interacts with say the DMV. If you get a driver’s license the state automatically registers you to vote and updates your information. It would work the same way with a standard state ID. You get a state ID, update an address or photo the state registers or updates your voter registration. Nobody says you have to vote but should you get a wild hair up your ass on Election Day you can show up and vote. 

It’s all about streamlining. If John Merrill was concerned about truly increasing voter registration then he’d just push for automatically registering everyone. Quite a few states do it already. 

You could even push the age down to 16 like you see in other countries. Automatically register everyone at 16 then have more civics education in the schools. The earlier in life people vote and get involved in the political process the more likely they are to stick with it the rest of their lives.

It's not all inclusive, but concentrate is enough, you can get smokeable/vapeable forms of concentrates, and you can make edibles from them as well. 

I hear a common fear from some of the more reluctant policy makers that aren't fully on board and it's typically the same thing that ""Medical marijuana leads to recreational marijuana."" well that's true, because once people see the benefits of it medically there is no point in trying to keep perpetuating ridiculous standards like prohibition of it, and once (if) Alabama's medical program goes through that's what will happen, it's been the natural progression of every state who's had a medical program before recreational, the people are timid at first, then slowly, they become much more accepting of it. 

That's how it was in Florida, now they have full access to both flower and concentrates and it's getting much easier to get your medical card.

I think there is also a push from a lot of chronic pain patients here as well who are sick and tired of being on opiates, Alabama has the highest opioid prescription rate in the country it's twice as high as the national average. And the worst thing about those drugs is once you've been using them long enough they become much less effective, so you use more, then you run out, and then you run into withdrawals and that's where people are turning to a lot of black market options including cannabis, and families from this state (including those families of some policy makers and politicians) are realizing at a rapid rate that they would much rather have their loved ones on a natural drug, that you can take long term and doesn't negatively impact your body in any significant ways.",1581461909,fhcf4pj

For point 2, I've always seen registering to vote to be the same as declaring which district you belong to. For stuff like state-wide positions, this isn't as important, but for the more localized stuff, registering to vote provides a way for your district to know that you are one of its constituents. 

This has the biggest impact on people who either move frequently or who move around the time of an election. I've known people who've been in a situation where they moved to a new district maybe a month before an election, but had to vote in their old district because their information had not been processed by the state in time for the election. 

If a voter is more stationary, then it's not as big of an issue.

I'm not an idiot (at least, I hope not) and wouldn't waste my money on lottery tickets anyway, but many coworkers would do those scratch-off things at the gas station as soon as they got paid.

b). Both generate substantial revenue for the state and neither are particularly onerous for those without a predisposition to addiction. I'm not a moral crusader bemoaning the fact that people with lower incomes pay more as a percentage on groceries because I'm in favor of flat taxes anyway, but I do take issue with those same moral crusaders unironically advocating something even worse for vulnerable populations because of the sheer hypocrisy involved.",1581530119,fheuep0
4513,o-ater,"Ok. I am not trying to conflate it, that was from the article and then the follow up replies that registering to vote could be easier.

To my mind, ""Suppression"" would require an active effort to stop people from voting. Sure, we could make improvements and enhancements to the convenience of it but that is not suppression.  Suppression would be groups of armed or menacing people blocking or intimidating at the entrance of the polling place, tearing up voter registrations, hassling voters inside the polling place by rejecting their proof of id (even though it's valid) etc.   None of that seems to be mentioned.  Only that it's hard to vote because it requires effort to fill out a form, get an ID, and show up on election day. Those things are not suppression to me.",1581530338,fheuscs

Why is that? Is getting an ID hard to do? (honest question)

4521,JennJayBee,"1. You just answered your own question. We're still by far one of the cheapest states (if not THE cheapest state) to live in, even with a property tax increase and that's nowhere near doubling it.

2. You get what you pay for. That includes where taxes are concerned. It's possible that maybe we should consider WHAT we're taxing and the quality of services you provide with those taxes rather than shoot for the lowest cost. Having the lowest taxes isn't exactly resulting in people flocking to Alabama. Matter of fact, the places with jobs where people keep wanting to move to also tend to be some of the most expensive places to live. But for what they pay in taxes, they get a hell of a return on quality schools and public services as well as better paying jobs.

Just how ignorant do you want me to make you look?  You know what, don't even answer that because I'm just going to let it fly.

A common refrain about Alabama is the state of the education system.  It's a fair point to make, it needs some serious help and restructure.  Keeping in mind that things don't go south (or north) overnight.  It takes some serious effort to do good (or bad) on a scale this large.

Guess who controlled the Alabama Educators Association?    

Democrats.  

Specifically one Paul Hubbert, who was the kingmaker for politicians in Alabama.  You didn't get elected at *any* post, much less governor, if the AEA (via Paul Hubbert) didn't support you.  Guess what political party this guy was devoutly affiliated with?

Democrats.

Guess who they worked to get elected?

Democrats.

So since about 1970 or so, the AEA (which is basically just an extension of the Democratic Party), controlled state politics, and controlled the educational system with an iron fist.  Their influence began to weaken in early 2000s (which coincidentally is when Bob Riley was elected and brute forced the state into modern times).  But sure, go ahead and blame Republicans.  Go ahead and blame *everyone else* for the systemic issues that affect Alabama that are a **direct result of Democrat contol**.

In a nutshell, the systemic problems in Alabama can be traced directly to the education system run by Democrats, that supported Democrats, and that ultimately failed them for 40+ years.

On top of that, those numbers are **heavily** inflated by foster children who aren't necessarily up for adoption. People lose their kids, and then get a chance to get them back. That means they aren't put up for adoption, they're put into foster care *until further notice*.

You don't seem to be aware of the male correlary of Roe v Wade.  Men and boys owe child support no matter what.  If they don't get a job and pay the bill, they can get locked up in a cage, lose their drivers license, lose their passport, lose their library card, etc.

After Hermesmann v Seyer set the precident, courts around the country have decided that male victims of women owe the perpetrators child support for decades, while other precidents and laws allow female victims many options to get rid of the product of their rapes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer

Hermesmann successfully argued that a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman

E.g.

Alabama man - https://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals-civil/1996/2950025-0.html

Arizona boy - https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/

California boy - https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-12-22-9612220045-story.html

Others - https://lawpublications.barry.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=cflj

There are many others out there. I do not beilive there has yet been a single case where a boy or man has gotten out of paying child support to an adult woman that statutory raped, raped, sperm jacked, etc.

The good news is that in recent years feminist lobbiests have pushed for laws to prevent rapists from getting child custody. Without custody the child wouldn't be raised by a rapist and the victim wouldn't owe child support. So the day that a male doesn't owe his perpetrator may be coming soon. The less good news is that just over half the states that passed these laws passed them as the feminist lobbiests proposed them - only preventing rapist fathers from getting custody.

Terrell v Torres recently set a precident and invalidated a signed contract to let a woman use embryos created with her ex and have him owe child support. https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/03/18/arizona-court-ruling-use-preserved-embryos-without-ex-husbands-consent-ruby-torres/3205867002/

Right. I keep hearing that’s the reason why the state won’t expand Medicare per the ACA, because it would cost too much. Not because they hate a government working for the people.

This is a problem that needs addressing first. This is pushing unskilled Alabamian labor off the bottom and they can only survive by having a skilled trade (as in OP's example, welders/shipbuilders) to elevate you back into the labor pool that the illegals cannot compete with yet. This is getting harder because in many building trades such as Electricians/HVAC/Pipefitters, some of the illegals are getting their Journeyman's cards, or ""borrowing"" someone else's, to work for less money. 

I work around this environment. I see it happening first-hand. Do you know how so many of them get legitimate jobs in factories like I listed above? I'll tell you. It's a shtick that's designed to grease both sides of the wheel and allow employers to cover their ass *and* give illegals a W2-required job:

-----------
* Immigrant with legal residency applies for a job at a fish factory.

* Immigrant gets granted an interview (let's call her Maria).

* Maria shows up to the interview, speaks decent English, impresses, and gets the job.

* Maria comes back to fill out her W2 information and provides proof of legal residency.

* First day of work Maria doesn't show up. Instead she sends her friend Isabella. Isabella heads straight in and begins studiously filleting away with little training.

* Isabella is about 3 inches shorter than Maria and speaks hardly any English at all, but she *looks* a lot like Maria and everyone is afraid to call her out because of the PC stigma in doing so.

* Isabella works this job 40-60 hours a week. She can already communicate with her coworkers in their native language, so her teamwork is not hindered. The company turns a blind eye because of her performance.

5000,Kornstalx,"Walk into a catfish farm around Demopolis or Greensboro. Or walk into any Peco facility. It's (no hyperbole) 90% a 4'10"" sea of Guatemalans, predominantly female. This is a problem that needs addressing first. This is pushing unskilled Alabamian labor off the bottom and they can only survive by having a skilled trade (as in OP's example, welders/shipbuilders) to elevate you back into the labor pool that the illegals cannot compete with yet. This is getting harder because in many building trades such as Electricians/HVAC/Pipefitters, some of the illegals are getting their Journeyman's cards, or ""borrowing"" someone else's, to work for less money. 

I work around this environment. I see it happening first-hand. Do you know how so many of them get legitimate jobs in factories like I listed above? I'll tell you. It's a shtick that's designed to grease both sides of the wheel and allow employers to cover their ass *and* give illegals a W2-required job:

-----------
* Immigrant with legal residency applies for a job at a fish factory.

* Immigrant gets granted an interview (let's call her Maria).

* Maria shows up to the interview, speaks decent English, impresses, and gets the job.

* Maria comes back to fill out her W2 information and provides proof of legal residency.

* First day of work Maria doesn't show up. Instead she sends her friend Isabella. Isabella heads straight in and begins studiously filleting away with little training.

* Isabella is about 3 inches shorter than Maria and speaks hardly any English at all, but she *looks* a lot like Maria and everyone is afraid to call her out because of the PC stigma in doing so.

* Isabella works this job 40-60 hours a week. She can already communicate with her coworkers in their native language, so her teamwork is not hindered. The company turns a blind eye because of her performance.

* On Friday, Isabella gets her paycheck. She gives it to Maria. Maria deposits it and pays Isabella cash. 

* **Also on Friday:** Sofía, Olivia, Ana, and Elisa all give their paychecks to Maria, since it has her name on it.

What the IRS sees at the end of the year is that a legal resident named Maria Lopez has five jobs and worked 250 hours a week. The IRS doesn't really care because Maria is paying taxes on every one of these checks, and to make it less conspicuous -- she's not filing for refunds, either.

&gt;A two-year probe by the FBI into allegations of systematic planting of evidence by the Dothan Police Department failed to generate a single substantiated case, according to a 38-page FBI summary.  
&gt;  
&gt;The summary, obtained by the *Dothan Eagle* through a Freedom of Information request and dated July 15, 2018, documented more than 40 interviews conducted in 2016 and 2017, a few months after a local blog post alleged a widespread conspiracy in the department to plant drugs on black residents. The blog post was retweeted thousands of times and gained some national attention.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish requested an FBI probe in response to the allegations. Agents with the FBI interviewed more than 30 people in two days at the La Quinta Inn in Dothan on June 28 and 29, 2016. Only a few of those interviewed alleged evidence planting. The rest leveled a variety of other complaints including excessive force, wrongful prosecution, inadequate legal representation, overly punitive sentences, and police retaliation. The FBI then conducted additional follow-up interviews in the following months and reviewed associated cases. The FBI supplemented the fresh interviews by reviewing previous complaints made to police related to evidence planting.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although the summary did indicate some allegations required follow-up work, none were related to evidence planting. Some allegations also indicated improper procedure was followed and officers were disciplined accordingly.

Just finished Brewer's book The Poet of Tolstoy Park. The contemplative inner dialogue and place-based details reminded me of Stegner a bit, although on the gulf coast. I enjoyed it. I felt that beyond Henry the characters were somewhat flat, but perhaps that was necessary since the book was, at it's heart, an exploration of his soul, and not of his relationships. Good book, although none of the characters seemed to be archetypal southern characters.

5389,this_is_my_new_acct,"First off, basically all of our State Parks are decent camping. Some could use an update, or may not have much for kids, but they're generally safe/clean/etc. Non-state parks, ymmv.

----

In the Mentone/Fort Payne area (soon after you cross over from Georgia) there is Little River Canyon National Preserve and Desoto State Park. Stay in Desoto, see both. Not a ton for kids other than natural beauty and hiking, but it's worth at least a day between the two areas. Mentone is small-town cute too.

In Little River Canyon there's a road you can take down to the Canyon Mouth Picnic Area. If you want a nice look at the canyon it's a decent drive with several nice pull-off areas, but it takes longer than you might think... maybe an hour each way (sorry, it's been a few years). I dunno when you're coming, but if there's even a hint of freezing temperatures do not do this drive (also don't drive a camper/rv/etc through even if the weather's nice). There are a few points where it's very steep with no turn arounds.

----

A little past that (and likely out of your way) is Lake Guntersville State Park. It's an okay campground (a tornado scrubbed all the trees from the area several years back, but they rebuilt) with little to do other than the lake. Time of year would likely dictate how much you care about the lake.

A bit north of here is Cathedral Caverns State Park. I have not been, but I've heard it's nice and it's easily within driving distance.

----

If you're on I-59 and you get to the Ashville exit then just a few miles north is Horse Pens 40. It isn't a state park, but they do have a crappy campground. BUT, it's one of the premier rock climbing locations in the country... worth wandering around for an hour, if nothing else. 

Maybe 20-ish minutes north of there is Palasaides Park in a town called Oneonta. It's a day-use park, so no camping, but it's got some great views + cliffs (tons of people rock climb/rappel).

If you decided to visit this area and you see the signs for Highland Lake, don't bother. It's a large pond surrounded by crappy houses with nothing to do.

----

South of the above two (but nowhere near the freeway) there's Cheaha State Park outside a town called Oxford. I've never camped there, so can't speak directly to it, but the grounds look nice from the road. The claim to fame here is Cheaha Mountain, which is the highest point in the state. On top of it they build a tower and you can see for a brazillion miles in every direction. The campground has a pool (that's closed this time a year) and I'm not sure what else there is for kids, but there's lots of trails.

----

South of there there's Wind Creek State Park near Alexander City. Good camping (but ask to see the spots before agreeing on one, it's hilly in spots), playgrounds, the lake, etc. This one can be fun to get a camping spot in during the summer because it's a great lake park.

----

Northwest of there quite a bit (less than an hour) is Desoto Caverns near Childersburg. It's super touristy, and I don't recall the state of the campgrounds, but in addition to the cave they have loads of stuff for kids to do. Bring your credit card though.

----

South of there I have nothing to offer. Feel free to ask followup questions... I was trying to more-or-less follow your possible routes, but if you want to go super far out of your way I have other ideas (like stuff in Birmingham or Huntsville... or Atlanta).",1582086236,fi2qiur

Also, there aren't alligators in the Gulf. You just have to watch for them in the delta and bay, and typically won't be hungry enough to go after something as large as a lab, especially one on a leash next to adult humans.",1582125147,fi3pzyr

5575,WikiTextBot,"**First pass effect**

The first pass effect (also known as first-pass metabolism or presystemic metabolism) is a phenomenon of drug metabolism whereby the concentration of a drug, specifically when administered orally, is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. It is the fraction of drug lost during the process of absorption which is generally related to the liver and gut wall. Notable drugs that experience a significant first-pass effect are imipramine, morphine, propranolol, buprenorphine, diazepam, midazolam, pethidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, ethanol (drinking alcohol), cimetidine, lidocaine, and nitroglycerin. In contrast some drugs are enhanced in potency: for example, the effect of the most commonly considered active ingredient in cannabis, THC, is enhanced by transformation of a significant portion into 11-hydroxy-THC that more readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and thus achieves greater potency than the original THC.  [Cannabis edible]

First pass metabolism may occur in the liver (for propranolol, lidocaine, chloromethiasole and GTN) or in the gut (for benzylpenicillin and insulin).After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic portal system.

5610,RedAsFolk,"The Confederacy seceded from the Union because they wanted to expand the slave system to the west and into South America; meanwhile, the quickly industrializing North needed free labor to build a Capitalist economy.

You can't have Capitalist industry with slave labor, as the wage laborer is a core component of Capitalist profit. The wage (w), itself, is the monetary value of the value required to reproduce the living and working ability of the worker and has no connection with the value created by labor during the working day (v). The difference between v and w is profit. As the slave is bought once, there is no room for capitalist exploitation (they're not paid a wage.) 

The North, outside of the abolitionist wing of the Republican party, supported slavery because industry needed the cheap raw material provided by the slaves. Only after industrial techniques were applied to agriculture (which, admittedly, was happening during the end of the 19th century) did it make sense to use wage labor in agriculture.

Long story short, the slave aristocrats were wanna-be Bourbons who wanted to build an empire. Their economic system was stagnant and quickly growing outmoded. The union only went to war after secession, again triggered by the limitation of slavery to the Southern states which was economically necessary for the growth of American capital.

This is something where the community leader of the same political party as the governor will be advising who to appoint and I don't think that decision will be based on qualifications but will be based on political ideology.

This is something the local voters, except possibly in larger cities do know about the candidates and the vetting is formal.

And would these appointed school board members come from the community or be from anywhere as long as their political beliefs are in line with who is governor when the appointments are made?

If the state wants to watchdog the local school boards instead of managing them, they could do one or both of these things.

1. have  a Governor appointed person serve as an advisory member that the locals can override unless it is something against state education laws.
2. the local school boards can send meeting transcripts to the Governor's office to be reviewed and if needed investigated.",1582248695,fi8ukld

Pardon me for believing studies based on provable facts and statistics. I’m sure this epidemic will be just as bad as SARS, Swine Flu, or West Nile Virus.. (we have a scare every couple of years... pay attention) meanwhile “faux intellectuals” disguised as PhDs are publishing studies because they want all of America to get sick and die so they can push the liberal agenda... #eyeroll 

So since you’re worried, I’m gonna give you a few good tips that may save your life! 

1. Wash your hands.. not just when you use the restroom, but every time you touch something with mass public exposure. Hand sanitizer is not the same as washing your fucking hands. 

2. Drink plenty of water. Beer, koolaide, sweet tea,  etc.. don’t count. A gallon a day of clear clean water. 

3. Get plenty of sleep. 6 hours or more. 8 preferably, but at least 6 

4. Exercise regularly, and avoid stress! And shower or at least wash your hands when you are done. 

5. Eat healthy food, and wash your hands first!! Alabama leads the nation (top 3) in obesity... this makes us more susceptible to sickness. 

6 Bathe regularly! This includes washing your hands!! ...enough said. 

7. For crying out loud... believe what the doctors who perform studies say instead of the one sided information pushed on television news stations. Remember, if it bleeds it leads.. they want you to be scared so you’ll stay tuned for details, thus improving their ratings. It’s how they make money, and at the end of the day money rules all.",1582741109,fiugs4w

As part of their abuse, House of Prayer was bringing children over to Alabama as soon as there were two parishioners' kids over 12 to force to marry to each other. That case led to Alabama raising its marriage age to 15 or 16. Living in Georgia while this case was ongoing and seeing the House of Prayer leverage our state's laws was what made me aware of child marriage as a modern issue, although I've also seen it in several other places since I started looking.

Ignore that you telecommute.  Let's say you're sick.  

Why is it a bad idea to go to work?

**That is why you don't move highly contagious people.**  You isolate them.  It's got nothing to do with the Christian thing to do, or the American thing to do, or ""some run to danger, others run from it"" thing to do.  **It's the smart, safe thing to do.**  And if you think about it, and put on your tinfoil hat for a minute, it's almost as if someone WANTS this to spread for chaotic (economic) reasons.

Beyond that, I can understand that you're so quick to dismiss the warnings.  We get hammered by TAKE COVER NOW BAD WEATHER COMING YOU'RE GONNA DIE every couple of weeks.  So you get a bit desensitized to the weather warnings.  I get it.  I'm guilty of it.

But here's the important thing:  The reason for issuing warnings and stressing the seriousness of it is that those warnings encouraged people to be vigilant, practice proper hygiene, etc.  Had people NOT headed those warnings, those potential pandemics could have turn into full fledged nightmares.

My financial livelihood in the international market has nothing to do with me taking these warnings *seriously*.  I only mentioned it as to *how bad it actually is in China and the far reaching economic effects it IS (not MIGHT) have*, because I have first hand knowledge of it from colleagues that *isn't* being reported.

&gt; Brown’s bill, which is being pre-filed for the 2020 regular session, allows bail to be denied to those who place the public at risk with their release, and it amends the Constitution to read: ”If no conditions of release can reasonably protect the community from risk of physical harm to the accused, the public, or both, ensure the presence of the accused at trial, or ensure the integrity of the judicial process, the accused may be detained without bail. Excessive bail shall not in any case be imposed or required.”

Before I pulled her and started homeschooling, my daughter was sent to the principal's office or sent home with a note on a pretty regular basis for being ""defiant."" What was she doing? She wasn't following instructions. Sometimes she'd sit with her paper and not do her work.

Why?

We'll, turns out she's autistic. As in, she had speech and other communication delays. She's been diagnosed since age three. It's not particularly bad. Just sometimes she needed things rephrased and explained a little better. No biggie. So she might not understand a teacher's instructions, and after being scolded for asking questions, she would just not do anything and wait for them to hopefully follow up. Usually, they didn't, and they'd just send the little problem kid out.

I begged and begged for them to simply repeat or rephrase their instructions, as was outlined in her IEP. I begged and begged for them to let her spend more time with the special ed teacher, where she was doing so well that they had her helping out in class. At the end of the day, she was just labeled as a problem kid by the gen ed teachers. They sent her classwork home, not bothering to cover it with her while she was in class. I ended up basically homeschooling her for four hours a night after school anyway, so I just eventually cut out the middle man. And she's more than thrived since.

Thing is, I can afford to do that. I'm lucky. There are unfortunately a lot of kids with parents who can't afford to do that, and for whom there is an easy and simple solution that teachers aren't even bothering with. Those kids aren't being defiant. They're not bad kids. And I hate to see what would happen to those kids if this passes.",1582903430,fj0mpb6

Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Alabama.

Alabama has the highest per capita capital sentencing rate in the country. In some years, its courts impose more death sentences than Texas, a state that has a population five times as large. However, Texas has a higher rate of executions per capita.

It'd be more of a concern, I think, if most of the voters were white, but if the black voters are either not showing up or voting for white candidates, that's a whole other issue that I'm not sure districting is going to fix. I'm also wondering if this is truly something that the black community in PG feels needs to be done, or if it's more a matter of the candidates who lost feeling like they need something to tip the scales in their favor since they might not have the support they feel like they should have. In a way, that's going around the wishes of black voters, too.

Now imagine that you’ve saddled a large swathe of the population with this economic burden, preventing them from meaningfully interacting with the economy, buying a house, etc. because they are throwing away so much of their paycheck every month into a pit.

“I shouldn’t be responsible for other people’s shortcomings” or as I like to say “Fuck them I got mine” is SUCH A BAD TAKE.

First, the point: she lost every southern state in the general that was her “firewall”. So throw up her or Biden’s performance in the primary against Bernie in southern states and see how much that helps you in November.

&gt; The Bernie Sander's Rust Belt went 3rd Party and cost her those electoral votes. Let's hope the BS voter doesn't feel the need to teach us another lesson.

This is, wow. Just wow.

The Democratic Party’s Rust Belt went Trump, FYI. No 3rd party candidate won a state, nevermind was even halfway competitive. You lose your “safe” states when you abandon the voters there and, partly, when you nominate a historically unpopular candidate.

But yes. Enough Bernie voters voted for Trump or 3rd to cover the difference. And if you’re simple minded, apparently that’s all you need. But you’re ignoring the millions that didn’t vote, voted but didn’t vote for president (\*\***cough**\*\* [fucking Michigan](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2016/11/michigans_presidential_electio.html) \*\***cough**\*\*), or wrote in Mickey Mouse or whatever. But if you’re looking to blame Bernie...

And go ahead and give Biden or Bloomberg a pass on their racism, thanks. See how that works for you.

And here’s bonus facts for you:

First

&gt; And according to one 2008 study, around 25 percent of Clinton primary voters in that election ended up voting for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the general.

From [Here's How Many Bernie Sanders Supporters Ultimately Voted For Trump](https://www.wbur.org/npr/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds).

Whereas about 12% of Bernie voters voted for Trump (same source). And the only candidate more unpopular than Clinton was Trump, so why was the margin of error that thin? Trump should’ve been resoundingly defeated but somehow wasn’t.

Second

Bernie campaigned the ever-living fuck out for Clinton. 

&gt; Since conceding defeat in the primaries, Sanders has been one of the real champions of this campaign. 

[Bernie Sanders’s Hard Fight for Hillary Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/bernie-sanderss-hard-fight-for-hillary-clinton)

&gt; “I’ve got to say,” Clinton said, turning to address Sanders. “This election’s been a lot more fun now that we’re on the same side.”

&gt; The independent Vermont senator smiled and bobbed his head. “I want to thank Bernie for everything he’s done,” she continued.

[Bernie Sanders Goes 'All In' for Hillary Clinton With an Eye Toward Post-Election Goals](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-eye-post-election-goals/story?id=43300037)

&gt; Given how far-reaching her likeability problem seems to be, there's probably not much Sanders can do to reverse that trend.

[Bernie Sanders is finally campaigning for Hillary Clinton. But does she even need him?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/05/bernie-sanders-is-finally-campaigning-for-hillary-clinton-but-does-she-even-need-him/)

By the way, that final link was an article written in early September, after he spent August writing a book. Between September and Election Day, he did near 40 rallies for Clinton. Which is somewhere around 3x the number of rallies she did for Obama.

&gt; local leaders were stunned to discover serious problems with the federal government’s plan for dealing with patients infected with the virus — starting with how the patients would get to Alabama
&gt; 
&gt; patients would be flown from California to the Fort McClellan Army Airfield in Anniston. The airfield was closed when the Army base was shuttered in 1999. Local officials said they told the HHS officials during the meeting the runway was in bad shape
&gt; 
&gt; The HHS plan also called for housing coronavirus patients at the Center for Domestic Preparedness, a FEMA facility on the old Army base and one of several redevelopment projects at the sprawling outpost.
&gt; 
&gt; But the center doesn’t have any special capabilities for handling infectious diseases, local officials said. The center is used for training. It has isolation hospital rooms — located in a former Army hospital building — but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town’s hospital, Regional Medical Center, about handling covid-19 patients.

- Republicans being Republicans

I graduated with a degree in engineering in 1981.  I took a position as an intern with the US Department of Defense for annual salary of $16,947, but with guaranteed promotions (if my performance reviews were acceptable).  At the time, I felt like a failure ... most of my friends were accepting jobs that paid around $20,000 annually.

Times were tougher that year than any in the 24 years I had been alive.  The US was officially in an economic recession.  The following year, 1982, the official unemployment rate soared to 11.8%.  Jobs were hard to come by; it was a tough time to begin a new career. And 30-yr fixed-rate mortgage interest rates rose to over 18% in 1981 (verify it). 

I've always felt I started out at the bottom.  It was almost a year before I could afford furniture; during that year, I ate off a cardboard box, and slept on an old mattress without a frame.

It was only recently that I realized that $16,947 in 1981 dollars is the equivalent of a starting salary, today, of $49,300.  (source)

Wrist-slashing has a much lower lethality rate, comparatively. 75% of all suicide attempts are by drug overdose, a method that is often thwarted because the drug is nonlethal, or is used at a nonlethal dosage. These people survive 97% of the time.

From [Suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attempt).

It’s estimated that sounds 85-90% of survivors do not die by suicide and only 4% of survivors have a fatal repeat attempt within 5 years, it goes to show that lower gun possession and ownership is tied to lower suicide numbers.

“As explained by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, the evidence showed that Woods was an integral participant in the intentional murder of these three officers. On the day the officers were killed, Mr. Woods talked to others about killing police officers; he taunted the officers and lured them into his apartment, where he knew they would be met by gunfire; he pointed the gunman to the third police officer; and he escaped with the gunman.

“Each officer died of multiple gunshot wounds. Two officers were shot in the back and one in the head, and none of the officers had an opportunity to discharge return fire. In fact, one officer’s weapon was still holstered.

“The state offered the testimony of 39 witnesses at Woods’ capital murder trial, including Officer Michael Collins, 25 other law enforcement officers, and forensic experts. There is no evidence, and no argument has been made, that Nathaniel Woods tried to stop the gunman from committing these heinous crimes. In fact, he later bragged about his participation in these horrific murders. As such, the jury did not view Woods’ acts as those of an innocent bystander; they believed that he was a fully engaged participant.

“A jury of Mr. Woods’ peers convicted him of four counts of capital murder. In the past 15 years, his conviction has been reviewed at least nine times, and no court has found any reason to overturn the jury’s decision.

“Under Alabama law, someone who helps kill a police officer is just as guilty as the person who directly commits the crime. Since 1983, Alabama has executed two individuals for being an accomplice to capital murder.",1583466327,fjmbodh

As a result, the serious questions about his culpability and the propriety of his sentence have never been adequately reviewed in either state or federal court.

7494,windershinwishes,"When minors identify as transgender, doctors may prescribe hormone blockers to delay the onset or continuation of puberty, which of course is an irreversible process. The blockers are reversible; once discontinued, puberty will resume. 

This only happens after extensive psychological counseling, such that medical professionals are confident that the kid is serious about their gender dysphoria issues and will be harmed by having their body go through unwanted changes. Even more time and counseling and experience publicly identifying as their preferred gender is required before a doctor will prescribe opposite-sex hormones (estrogen or testosterone) to the patient. Parents are involved during this whole process with doctors.

This bill is telling doctors that they can’t do any of that; it’s the legislature deciding that they know better than the minor patients, their parents, and their doctors.

It will result in trans kids going through unwanted, irreversible changes to their bodies. Assuming you’re a man, imagine how distressing it would be to watch as your body gradually became female, and there’s nothing you can do about it, and the government says you’re a freak on top of it.

Social stigma and the experience of going through unwanted puberty will result in teen suicides. We know this for a fact; medical studies have shown that hormone/blocker therapy, along with counseling, and perhaps most importantly along with social acceptance, reduces suicide rates among trans youth.

Years of peer reviewed studies that have been published in high quality journals, the consensus opinion of experts, and the position of every major medical and academic institution supports transgender people.

As for my stance on the issue (just anticipating that it will be wrongly assumed), I’m not a medical professional and I don’t claim to have any expert opinion. So long as some teenager isn’t persuaded to permanently alter their bodies at a time in their life when identity and hormones are in constant flux I really don’t see the harm in something like hormone blockers. It seems like the aim of this bill was to protect people from themselves and I generally don’t condone such actions by the government.

Gender dysphoria is a psychological disorder. Any actual therapy would consist of helping them learn to cope with and accept who they are, not treating them like lab rats to experiment on with powerful, life altering drugs and dismemberment or other surgery. 

If you think it's okay just ask yourself how far the entire scenario should be taken. What if kids didn't want to grow up and there were drugs to keep them from aging? Should that be allowed? Or what if kids felt like they wanted to die, and doctor assisted suicide was legal in Alabama. Should that be allowed? What if a kid felt like a dog or a cat? Should a doctor be allowed to implant fangs and hair all over their body?

Never said nor implied that. Well, not intentionally anyway. So I apologise for any confusion.

&gt;Puberty is blocked, not their mental growth. 

First, that's a farcical claim that you simply can't prove. Second, that's kinda my point about kids needing to grow through puberty. Because a lot happens in the mental aspect of growing through puberty. 

&gt;That's the point. To put things off until they know for sure.

And I'm pretty sure that's the point of this law. I mean, right? It's to stop *children, not adults*, from allowing doctors to do something irreversible to them. Nobody anywhere is suggesting an adult suffering from the mental anguish associated with gender dysphoria should not be allowed to have any kind of therapy or surgery.

&gt;And if they get to that point where they can make that decision for themselves, ~~they~~ **adults** can weigh the reasons you list. 

Not to be a smartass but, FTFY. Adulthood *is* the point where they can make that decision for themselves. By law. Legally. It's concrete. There's no arguing against that fact.

&gt;But it's not your call 

Never said nor implied that it is. Again, sorry for any confusion. But I think you're jumping to conclusions. 

&gt;they have to first go through puberty before they begin the transitioning process

That makes sense to me. They should grow into adults by growing through childhood, part of which is growing through puberty. Otherwise you're letting prepubescent children make life altering decisions they're neither mentally nor emotionally adequately suited to make. 

&gt;is not a quick jump into surgery, which I know a lot of people think it is. 

No, there's a process before that happens. And I think that process needs to be looked at and picked over with a fine toothed comb by the professionals without fear of being attacked or fired. Because as much as so many people want to beat their chest and jump up and down screaming ""The entire scientific community agrees"" and then blasting us with preloaded links, the fact is there's just nowhere near enough evidence to definitively prove that process is what's best for children with gender dysphoria. It's my understanding that a lot of the evidence that does support it comes through coercive or severely biased means. In other words, some doctors that differ in opinion are threatened or professionally blackballed.

&gt;No, they want to be accepted as something they're not...

Trans people, just like you have a better sense of who they are than other people. It is not your place to tell them who they are.

&gt;Gender dysphoria is a psychological disorder. Any actual therapy would consist of helping them learn to cope with and accept who they are

So, in other words....conversion therapy which is not only proven to be ineffective, but also is a form of torture that results in literally dead kids.

&gt;not treating them like lab rats to experiment on with powerful, life altering drugs

HRT is just hormones. The life altering effects you are against actually provide positive outcomes for the patients who are not lab rats. They are people and this treatment has been around nearly 50 years. It's in no way experimental.

&gt;and dismemberment or other surgery.

Yet more dishonest framing of optional surgeries that are often not even persued and of you wanted less ""other surgeries"" to be required to treat these people, HRT would negate that form of treatment almost outright when HRT is available to trans people at a young enough age to make the most difference.

&gt;If you think it's okay just ask yourself how far the entire scenario should be taken. What if kids didn't want to grow up and there were drugs to keep them from aging? Should that be allowed? Or what if kids felt like they wanted to die, and doctor assisted suicide was legal in Alabama. Should that be allowed? What if a kid felt like a dog or a cat? Should a doctor be allowed to implant fangs and hair all over their body? 

This is just the ""attack helicopter"" meme. It's nothing more than a false equivalency. Everyone has a gender identity and it is immutable. Comparisons to species or inanimate objects are just pure ignorance. A human being cannot reasonably identify  as anything else other than a human being. A human being does however identify as a gender because we are a gendered species and that is part of our developmental process which is not limited to sexual reproductive organs. Our entire bodies are literally sexually dimorphic and to think the brain itself is somehow uniquely exclusionary to this process is at best wishful thinking.

&gt;If you think those scenarios seem outrageous and offensive, I agree.

Shocking you agree with your own dishonest emotional charged logic.

&gt;But I don't really see a big difference in any of the scenarios because allowing a child with a mental disorder to make that kind of decision is outrageous and offensive.

Children develop a solidified gender identity at ages 4-6. This is a biological reality of our species and it is immutable. A brain that forms a gender identity is in fact, a normal functioning brain. This is why being transgender isn't actually a mental illness but GID, which results from the discongruence between body and mind and is amplified by gender roles imposed by society, is.

7668,JennJayBee,"&gt; First, that's a farcical claim that you simply can't prove.

Plenty of people have taken puberty blockers and can tell you that they still grow in intelligence. To say that they aren't mentally growing to a point where they can better make a decision and then to say that can't be proven one way or another is to ignore than this isn't something that hasn't been done.

&gt; Second, that's kinda my point about kids needing to grow through puberty. Because a lot happens in the mental aspect of growing through puberty.

Such as...? What better decisions did you make as a result of puberty? Did you personally not know or understand your gender or were unsure until after puberty? 

Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything if they're unsure. That is the point. Hell, nobody is forcing anyone to do anything if they are sure. That's the point.

&gt;And I'm pretty sure that's the point of this law. I mean, right? It's to stop *children, not adults*, from allowing doctors to do something irreversible to them.

**Puberty blockers are not irreversible.** Puberty, on the other hand is. So no, the law does the opposite of that. The law forces an irreversible process on children without the consent of the child, their parents, or their doctors.

This is where I think the confusion is regarding the rest of your post. Puberty blockers are a pause button, not a stop button. So why would you argue that someone can't be allowed to wait until they're of an age where they can legally make up their own minds and THEN make the decision as to how to proceed with puberty and whether or not to proceed with hormonal therapy?

Further, **this doesn't just affect trans kids**. We're essentially unnecessaryily forcing kindergarteners to go through puberty to stick it to the trans community, because people don't understand this process beyond the scary-sounding rhetoric and because, as cis individuals, we can't wrap our heads around what a trans person goes through when they're forced to go through puberty.

This will literally result in dead children. How anyone can't grasp that as a bad thing is beyond me.",1583592291,fjs0ntr

That being said, I was raised in this state, by the most conservative minded people; anything they didn't understand was attacked and lampooned in the name of god. They were bigoted and oppressive and most of their arguments and reasons are the same as ""Alabama conservatives"". I, for one, am completely baffled on how to handle the issues surrounding trans folks and  especially trans kids. I have none of those feelings and as far as I know, neither do my kids or any close relative/friend/acquaintance. So, I do not feel comfortable making laws that affect those people, but would instead rely on medical professionals to determine what is best, not the whims of my cousin Bobbi-joe, or my communities preachers. I have so rarely seen compassion from ""Alabama conservatives"", that all these arguments in their favor makes me think religion is actually a negative force in our community.

Basically to some it up

Me: all of this science done over decades, hundreds of peer reviewed studies, all support this treatment with kids who persistently present as trans, a very very small percentage of people eventually stop medically transitioning or medically de-transition, if these treatments were regularly mis-prescribed we would see statistically relevant numbers of people de-transitioning. People like buck angel transitioned in the 1990s so its not like this is brand new.

You: I read all your studies and citations in like an hour or so, evidence seems bad,  we should not give these kids treatment. The consensus opinion of relevant experts, the conclusions of decades of peer reviewed studies published in some of the best journals, and the position of every major medical and academic institution dont matter to me, I know better.

7741,TheGoldenOculus,"The thing is, and this is where the hard oppositional vitriol comes from, there are axes of issue where there's not a middle ground argument.

There's no valid response to, 'Gay people shouldn't be able to be legally discriminated against.' other than agreement. Otherwise you create a situation in which the rights of a group of people are arguable.

And they shouldn't be.

If you don't support gay rights, full stop, you are an enemy to gay people. If you don't support trans rights, full stop, you're an enemy to trans people. The opposition to this isn't a real reasonable position, and being civil to it is validating it.

On the broader political stage, a man like Mitch McConnell promising to stonewall all legislation if there isn't a Republican president is the Congressional equivalent of this same sort of hostility. There's not a middle ground to be found here.

So there's this band of issues in the forefront of people's minds where, yes, if you disagree there's not room for civil disagreement at all. Especially if you happen to be a part of one of these marginalized groups I've talked about.

I don't know what to tell you. There's not a satisfying answer, even for me. I'm a hard Leftist living in a hard right state and I've spent a lot of time trying to mediate and convince people not from around here that, disagreements aside, the people are ok. Normal. Not malicious.

And they shouldn't be.

While there are fringes of our current population that find themselves in religious opposition to gays and trans people, it is not what makes up the political opposition to many of the issues surrounding such Americans. My POV is one of a libertarian. I simply don’t want the govt to be making these decisions. I don’t believe the govt should be able to tell anyone who they can marry or what they can do to their own body. 

However, for most republicans, the root of the disagreement is the premise. Currently, there are no legal forms of discrimination. In fact, there are many laws against such discrimination. I think the concern of republicans is that the issue has been blown up to the point of absurdity. Why are we so focused on trans rights that effect less than a single digit percentage of our population? Couldn’t we talk about immigration? Or taxes? Or things that impact every Americans’ daily lives? It has never really been about legal protection. That exists. For the republicans it’s been about opposing using the legislature to enforce social protection. That type of thing has a dangerous tendency to infringe on freedoms for all Americans. 

Again, I’m playing devils advocate here. Don’t blast me because I’m portraying their POV. 

There is always a middle ground. And I think it’s been a tendency of the left recently to assign moral high ground to political beliefs where they don’t belong.

&gt;&gt;A brain that forms a gender identity is in fact, a normal functioning brain.

&gt;I agree. But a brain that forms a gender identity opposite the actual biologically immutable gender is not a normal functioning brain.

You've conceded that both gender identity is an outcome of brain development and a normal functioning brain has one. That's a start.

&gt;You can pretend gender is nothing more than a role erroneously placed on people by society, but in doing so you're ignoring science. 

But I'm not and you are the one pretending to know what I'm thinking when you can't as well. This is a strawman argument you are building and this is not my position at all. Gender roles and gender identity describe 2 different things and you presume my position is that ""gender is nothing more than a role erroneously placed on people by society"" and that  ""in doing so"" I am ""ignoring science?"" Social science? No I'm fully aware of gender roles and the distinction and how both interact in relation to GID. You don't seem to be though.

You've been dishonest yet again and if it wasn't intentional, i can forgive it but you are only arguing with yourself here, not me.

&gt;Would you recommend a hoarder buy a bigger house to store their junk? Would you recommend a paedophile limit themselves to 12 and above? Would you recommend a cutter only cut where their clothes can hide it? 

What false equivalency are you trying to make? It seems you equate transition to cutting, increasing storage space, and yes even brought up pedophilia. None of these comparisons are fair. Transgender people have a gender identity they are not free to express and by preventing access to transition, they are made to suffer....and we know the horrifying result of that.

Whether you agree or disagree, transition, both socially and medically, as it's needed, is the most effective way to treat trans people.

&gt;I'm sure that if you're an honest person, the answer to those things would be a resounding no. 

Again, you built a strawman and here you are declaring victory and if I don't conceded, I'm dishonest. Your premise was a position I do not hold, is invariably flawed, and no one owes you an answer under these circumstances. If you want an honest answer, ask an honest question.

&gt;But why? It's because those solutions aren't really solutions at all, but are instead attempts to mask or even coddle the mental disorders.

As previously mentioned. Your argument depends on the false pretense that transition doesn't reduce GID when it does. You are suggesting transitioning makes a person become what? More transgender? No it just makes them much less likely to suffer bad mental health.

&gt;Yet here you are, not only attempting to normalize gender dysphoria, but taking it a step further by refusing to admit it is a disorder at all. For shame... Go ahead with your flat earth, anti-vax, climate denying bad self.

Now you are equivocating transgender people to flat earthers, anti vaxxers, and climate deniers while imposing those beliefs on me. Again this is dishonest. 

You seem to be missing the fact that science doesn't support those 3 examples but it does support the medical transition of transgender people and validates their experiences. In addition I acknowledge specifically GID is a disorder and that is something many transgender people experience to varying degrees and due to complex reasons. It is however not the same thing as being transgender which is just a adjective describing a state of being. Again a normal functioning brain isn't disordered and this is why merely being transgender isn't classified as a disorder any longer as we have a better understanding of now, via the sciences, that gender isn't simply binary.

If you really want to follow this through, you have to admit that a transgender person who does not experience GID has a normal functioning brain and those people do exist as a result of medical and social transition. You can't ""normalize"" GID when it's being reduced and eliminated by treatment. Would you suggest we are normalizing any mental illness by treating it? Of course not.

&gt;What false equivalency are you trying to make? It seems you equate transition to cutting, increasing storage space, and yes even brought up pedophilia. None of these comparisons are fair. 

It's only a false equivalency if it's false. In this case, all three are a legitimate equivalency. Are you honestly suggesting they are not all a result of mental disorders? I mean, is that really a hill worth dying on?

&gt;Whether you agree or disagree, transition, both socially and medically, as it's needed, is the most effective way to treat trans people.

Well that's just, like, your opinion man... 

First, need is subjective. And again, much of the data in many of the fields that study gender dysphoria is skewed via bias or coercion. There's no definitive answer about it either way. Professionals in the fields that study it are not all in agreement about even the best way to understand it. Therefore, they're not all in agreement about the best way to treat it. By a long shot... 

Suggesting otherwise is literally, by definition, science denial. You're doing that...

&gt;if I don't conceded, I'm dishonest. 

Yes, because you're denying science with boldfaced lies that you keep telling yourself such as ""I know everything about it"" and ""everyone agrees about it"" and ""the science is in"". And that's all bullshit...

&gt;As previously mentioned. Your argument depends on the false pretense that transition doesn't reduce GID when it does. 

Whoooooa. Hold your horses... Nobody ever said that. 

The summation of your argument overall is that I'm being presumptive. But the fact is that is *exactly* what you are doing.

&gt;You are suggesting transitioning makes a person become what? More transgender? No it just makes them much less likely to suffer bad mental health.

I never suggested otherwise. Again, you are projecting your presumptions onto me. 

&gt;Now you are equivocating transgender people to flat earthers, anti vaxxers, and climate deniers. 

How could you get this so twisted?! No! I'm equivocating ***YOU*** to flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, and climate deniers. Because ***YOU*** are the one denying science...

I'm not missing that. In fact, that's my argument regarding exactly what you are doing with your argument...

&gt;but it does support the medical transition of transgender people and validates their experiences.

Yes, because validating people with mental disorders is exactly what the sciences should do... No bias there, folks...

&gt;You can pretend gender is nothing more than a role erroneously placed on people by society, but in doing so you're ignoring science. 

Are you or are you not suggesting that i believe something in which I do not. How exactly can I pretend to believe something I'm literally denying. For you to make this statement assumes what I am thinking and what I'm saying and trying to point out a hypocrisy.

&gt; Second, they're not so terribly different as to make your pathetic excuse for an argument worth it, right? You are competent enough to understand that gender roles *stem* from gender identity much the same way behavior *stems* from understanding... 

Now you've been insulting and spat out a bunch of gibberish about ""understanding"". I've already said myself that gender identity and gender roles interact and the only thing I can glean from this gibberish is that you think gender roles are determined by gender identities. I'm not inclined to disagree, however you are not saying anything meaningful here either. Behaviors also stem from a lack of understanding. This is exactly how ignorance leads to violence and oppression of a misunderstood minority.

Hopefully you get to the point soon.

&gt;&gt;and you presume my position is that ""gender is nothing more than a role erroneously placed on people by society"" and that ""in doing so"" I am ""ignoring science?"" Social science? 

&gt;There are several fields of study regarding the matter. And they're all sciences. Are you fucking with me? Did you hit your head? 

You clearly don't understand this. I pointed out that you misrepresented me, shockingly, again, and asked for clarification about which branch of science you might be referring and you reply ""duh there are multiple branches of science related to gender"". No kidding. You also ignored the fact you misrepresented my position in the process. This is a pattern.

&gt;Holy shit! That's amazing!!! The world's smartest Redditaur, ladies and gentlemen, knows everything about all the different sciences that study gender dysphoria... 

Never made that claim at all and the unnecessary exaggeration is telling. It's another misrepresentation. The fact is I do know a ton about this this subject because I deal with it on a day to day basis and have been studying it for decades and I'll be the first to admit I don't know everything about GID, but all I've done is lay out some basic facts about transgender people and GID and that's apparently triggered a response.

&gt;Look, you can tell yourself that line of bullshit till the cows come home, but I'm not buying anything from anyone that doesn't know biology, psychology, and yes even sociology etc. are sciences. 

So now you've carried this so far you are dismissing a simple statement about my level of awareness on a complex issue because you created some nonsense in your head that I don't understand science has fields of study BECAUSE I asked you for clarification. Again you are not trying to have a conversation proven by the fact you thought the question was hypothetical. I was merely trying to understand your argument.

&gt;And I'm certainly not buying anything from anyone pretending to be fully aware of all of the relevant sciences related to studying gender dysphoria.

I am fully aware of these concepts and interactions as I've been dealing with this subject matter for about 35 years. I do not however know everything there is to know. You probably can't see a distinction I guess. I'm still learning and science is still advancing.

If you are still stuck on whether or not being transgender is a mental disorder, then it's you who is refuting science. We're you the one earlier who thought because there is some dissent in the scientific community that there must be insufficient evidence to support the medical consensus on transition as the best form of treatment?

&gt;&gt;What false equivalency are you trying to make? It seems you equate transition to cutting, increasing storage space, and yes even brought up pedophilia. None of these comparisons are fair. 

&gt;It's only a false equivalency if it's false. In this case, all three are a legitimate equivalency. Are you honestly suggesting they are not all a result of mental disorders? I mean, is that really a hill worth dying on?

Sure let's climb this hill. In all your examples, you cited the treatment as making a mental illness worse but then illness you have repeatedly cited is GID as the disorder that needs to be treated. Your equivalencies are false because when GID is treated by transition, it is alleviated, reduced, and eliminated in many cases. The more a patient can function in society without being harassed, and the happier they are with their bodies, the more likely their GID subsides and as a result overall mental health improves dramatically.

You repeatedly try to create a framework where a transgender person just being trans is a bad outcome and it's simply not. Cutting more, hoarding more, and sexually assaulting kids by a refined standard perpetuate and/or intensify those mental illnesses, assuming pedophilia is that. They do not alleviate it.

So again clarification is needed. Do you see the goal of treating trans people to get them to stop being trans? Or just to treat their GID?

&gt;&gt;Whether you agree or disagree, transition, both socially and medically, as it's needed, is the most effective way to treat trans people.

&gt;Well that's just, like, your opinion man... 

It actually isn't just my opinion. It's a literal fact and why we treat GID with medical transition as needed.

&gt;First, need is subjective.

As I already conceded to repeatedly. What a patient needs is between themselves, their doctors. 

&gt;And again, much of the data in many of the fields that study gender dysphoria is skewed via bias or coercion. There's no definitive answer about it either way. Professionals in the fields that study it are not all in agreement about even the best way to understand it. Therefore, they're not all in agreement about the best way to treat it. By a long shot... 

Suggesting otherwise is literally, by definition, science denial. You're doing that...

Yeah you were the guy and your repeating this nonsense again. You require 100% of all doctors to agree on a form of treatment? That isn't how consensus works. Science doesn't deal in absolutes either so your claim there is no definitive answer means nothing. Science is by it's very nature conservative in how it treats it findings and when medical science has determined that medical transition is successful in treating GID, that's not bias as these results and methods are peer reviewed. Again science is self correcting and in that process, bias is considered. 

&gt;Yes, because you're denying science with boldfaced lies that you keep telling yourself such as ""I know everything about it"" and ""everyone agrees about it"" and ""the science is in"". And that's all bullshit...

What has science stated I'm denying. I do not know everything, and everyone does not agree and yes what YOU just said was BS.

&gt;&gt;As previously mentioned. Your argument depends on the false pretense that transition doesn't reduce GID when it does. 

&gt;Whoooooa. Hold your horses... Nobody ever said that.

&gt;The summation of your argument overall is that I'm being presumptive. But the fact is that is *exactly* what you are doing.

Then acknowledge my criticism of your equivalencies and stop with the ""nah uh u are!"" crap. It's crap.

&gt;You are suggesting transitioning makes a person become what? More transgender? No it just makes them much less likely to suffer bad mental health.

&gt;I never suggested otherwise. Again, you are projecting your presumptions onto me. 

Well great then. You agree medical transition is a good treatment for GID? Where's the issue exactly?

&gt;Now you are equivocating transgender people to flat earthers, anti vaxxers, and climate deniers. 

&gt;How could you get this so twisted?! No! I'm equivocating ***YOU*** to flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, and climate deniers. Because ***YOU*** are the one denying science...

You edited out the bit about my beliefs or didn't catch the edit. I'll give u the benefit of doubt.

&gt;&gt;You seem to be missing the fact that science doesn't support those 3 examples 

&gt;I'm not missing that. In fact, that's my argument regarding exactly what you are doing with your argument...

So your claim is that science doesn't support medical transition? It clearly does and again that's why it's used.

&gt;Because validating people with mental disorders is exactly what the sciences should do... No bias there, folks...

The way this works, again, is you diagnose a disorder, in this case GID, and you treat it. If the treatment is successful, it reduces or eliminates the disorder. Medical transition does exactly that. Again, is your problem that these patients are still considered transgender by the medical community and that is no longer considered a disorder?

&gt;&gt;Again, if you want to have an honest discussion, ask honest questions and I encourage you to look into logical fallacies as you seem to employ some common ones quite often. 

&gt;Likewise...

Every question I've asked you has been honest and without loaded framing. If you do not think so, present a question I asked in bad faith.",1583655643,fjx3zh6

Lee was [considered a cruel slave owner.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/):

Lee’s cruelty as a slavemaster was not confined to physical punishment. In Reading the Man, the historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor’s portrait of Lee through his writings, Pryor writes that “Lee ruptured the Washington and Custis tradition of respecting slave families,” by hiring them off to other plantations, and that “by 1860 he had broken up every family but one on the estate, some of whom had been together since Mount Vernon days.” The separation of slave families was one of the most unfathomably devastating aspects of slavery, and Pryor wrote that Lee’s slaves regarded him as “the worst man I ever see.”

Nor was he afraid of physically abusing slaves:

When two of his slaves escaped and were recaptured, Lee either beat them himself or ordered the overseer to ""lay it on well."" Wesley Norris, one of the slaves who was whipped, recalled that “not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with brine, which was done.”

One unappreciated aspect of Lee's Generalship is that during both of Lee's invasions of loyalist territory (the Maryland campaign and the Gettysburg campaign) [he kidnapped and sent into slavery thousands of free US citizens](https://deadconfederates.com/2010/07/01/old-pete-slave-raids-and-the-gettysburg-campaign/). Historical revisionism aside, Robert E Lee was a slaver who killed and kidnapped American citizens in service to a treason that was [one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant#Personal_Memoirs_of_General_U._S._Grant_(1885)",1583849182,fk3y6ty

Lee and King aren't the only two sharing days. I'm surprised the American Indian Heritage folks aren't up in arms sharing their day with Columbus day..again who voted on this and why? Both of these votes were douchebag moves. 
3. So 16 weeks are spoken for so what about the remaining 38 weeks in th eyear.

MARCH 10, 2020 

DAVID SHER 

&amp;#x200B;

Mountain Brook City Hall

&amp;#x200B;

I didn’t know what to expect when I began publishing ComebackTown in 2012, but the one thing I didn’t expect was to be judged negatively for having lived in Mountain Brook.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I cringe whenever I make that disclosure because I know some readers and commenters will judge me based on where I lived—even though they don’t know me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to do a Google search to see what I could find.

&amp;#x200B;

Look up Mountain Brook in the Urban Dictionary and you will read “Mountain Brook is home to most of Alabama’s ‘elite…Detractors…are quick to point out its “close-minded, ivory tower mentality,”

&amp;#x200B;

I found this article on Odyssey Online, 18 Sure-Tell Signs You Grew Up In Mountain Brook, Alabama.

&amp;#x200B;

Sign #1: “You’ve been called a ‘Brookie’ by every single person you’ve met who isn’t from Mountain Brook.”

&amp;#x200B;

Sign #2: “When you introduce yourself, you say you’re from Birmingham to avoid all possible discriminatory comments.”

&amp;#x200B;

Internet commenters often insinuate residents are narcissistic, self-centered, arrogant, and have a sense of entitlement.

&amp;#x200B;

When I try to stand up for Mountain Brook, I get boohooed for asking folks to feel sorry for a bunch of rich people.

&amp;#x200B;

We all understand stereotyping. People stereotype African-Americans, Southerners, Alabamians, immigrants, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Some folks from out of state stereotype Alabamians as bigoted and uneducated, but that doesn’t describe the Alabamians I know.

&amp;#x200B;

There are obviously good and bad people everywhere and that includes Mountain Brook.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the greatest respect and admiration for Mountain Brook residents.  Many are generously involved in our broader community–volunteering, serving on boards and leadership positions of non-profits, and donating to charities.

&amp;#x200B;

This is as it should be because people with money should be generous with their time and resources.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s easy to understand why folks want to live in Mountain Brook—great schools, beautiful neighborhoods, and a responsive city government. In a recent survey 98% of city residents rated Mountain Brook as an excellent or good place to live and raise children.

&amp;#x200B;

But why does the income and racial chasm seem to be greater in Birmingham than other Southern cities?

&amp;#x200B;

We in Jefferson County have divided ourselves into 35 municipalities often defined by race and income.

&amp;#x200B;

The City of Birmingham is perceived as black and poor; Mountain Brook as white and rich. Vestavia Hills—white; Fairfield—black, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Nashville, our neighbor to the north, has a county-city government– so Davidson County and Nashville are one and the same.  Nashville is neither perceived as black/white or rich/poor.   Folks in Nashville share a common mission and vision–while we often concentrate on our differences. Nashville is a city on the move—our Birmingham region struggles.

&amp;#x200B;

But there’s hope. Last year 23 mayors signed a Good Neighbor Pledge and have agreed to work together. Mayor Stuart Welch of Mountain Brook has driven this important effort.

&amp;#x200B;

We are a great community–we need to concentrate on working together—that’s how our Birmingham region will prosper.

8224,Groomingham,"I like how you put all the people who have switched parties as suddenly ""racist dixiecrats from the south"" who switched parties.

 The mayor of Los Angeles was a dixiecrat? The Governor of Nebraska is a Dixiecrat? The Gov of California? The ambassador to Luxembourg? The ambassador to the UN? The Mayor of Alexandria? Mayor of Philadelphia? Representative of Nevada? Gov of Massachusetts?  

You just took anyone that switched parties at any time within a 30 year window and lumped them into ""racist dixiecrats that changed parties"". 
I can give you a longer list of people who actually were racist, like: 

Robert Byrd, Hubert Humphrey, Mike Mansfield, James Eastland, Joe Biden and George Wallace who continued to stay in the Dem party. 


In June of 1964, though, the Civil Rights bill came up again, and it passed...over the strenuous objections of Southern Democrats.  80% of House Republicans voted for the measure, compared with just 61% of Democrats, while 82% of Republicans in the Senate supported it, compared with 69% of Democrats.

Nearly all of the opposition was, naturally, in the South, which was still nearly unanimously Democratic and nearly unanimously resistant to the changing country.  One thing that most assuredly didn't change, though, was party affiliation.  A total of 21 Democrats in the Senate opposed the Civil Rights Act.  Only one of them, ""Dixiecrat"" Strom Thurmond, ever became a Republican.  The rest, including Al Gore, Sr. and Robert Byrd--a former Exalted Cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan--remained Democrats until the day they died.

Just because someone switches parties doesn't mean they were part of the Dixiecrats. 

Please show me the Democrats that opposed the civil rights bill that switched to Republican. I mean, I'll give you Strom Thurmond, but not a single other person that opposed the Civil Rights bill ever switched to the Republican Party.

Another impact to the culture of Alabama on the economic side (especially in the antebellum period, and overlapping the powerful impacts of slavery) was the economic class differences that permeated the state from south to north, the local cultural influence of a well developed 19th century port city that Mobile had become, rivaling New Orleans for a time (and with direct access to Havana, New Orleans, New York, Europe), moving upland to the large coastal/near coastal plantations, and further north increasing numbers of small (and poorer) sustenance farms.  The kinds of crops grown, and their yields for export vs. (in the case of cotton) for domestic mill use in the various regions also made impacts.  And the iron ore industry around Birmingham.  And, of course, the development of the rail road vs. traditional river barge traffic in the region.

Either way even if this bill is as ridiculously restrictive as you claim and I'm completely wrong (which I'll accept), they will eventually open up to more forms of use including smoking as the medical program evolves and the knowledge of cannabis expands in the commission. I'm sure people will be able to take complaints and suggestions like allowing herbal vaporizers to the commission board and be able to get flower allowed through that avenue at least.

8445,Ltownbanger,"Bungled doesn't begin to describe it. 

Imagine if there was a federal facility within 2 hours of this case that specialized in treating and quarantining carona virus victims to keep them alive and keep their families from spreading it throughout the community. It could be on, like, an abandoned military base and staffed with specialists brought from around the country and globe. We could have the governor and local doctors working hand in hand with the feds in a world class pandemic treament facility. We'd, of course, have deals forged by the governor where all state facilies are at the top of the list for receiving tests and, when available, the vaccine.

If only we had such an opportunity it would surely be seized at great benefit to all citizens and demonstrate to the world what a great place is our state of Alabama.

Treat it like a bad flu season, take *reasonable* precautions (wash your hands often, don't lick someones hand that just coughed in it) and be done with it.  Live your life like normal.  

Short of holing up in your parents basement yelling for chicken tenders while wearing a gas mask, there's nothing you can do.  Just like the flu, you'll either get it or not get it.

8448,SaharaCez,"Interesting state constitutional quandary. I wonder if the Alabama supreme court has taken up such cases, or have past precedents that make the issue moot.  In GA, the Georgia constitution overtly gives the upper hand of power to its 159 counties, making it very difficult for the Gold Dome to usurp power already constitutionally authorized as local.  (to both good and bad effect over the decades.)

My husband and I tried to sign up for the salamander crossing that happens near Samford University with Oak Mountain but for whatever reason we were never informed when it happened. And now I don’t have Facebook anymore so I will probably miss out on a lot of event info.

Shaver said she previously worked as a counselor for pregnant women and for women after abortions. She declined to give any specifics.   
....  
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, said Alabama law bans abortions after the age when a baby could survive outside the womb. England asked Shaver why she did not report the doctors involved in the cases she said she was told about. England said it’s already a crime in Alabama for a doctor to abort a viable fetus.

“It was after the fact by the time that I heard about it,” Shaver said.

“There’s really no after the fact in that situation,” England said.""

The exception - obviously, before the ""well ACKSHUALLY if you have XYZ"" people rush in with a flurry of downvotes because they simply cannot understand context - is old people and young kids, or if you have other underlying *serious* issues. 

Quarantine is the best way to help it not spread.  This is about helping those who are most vulnerable.  Otherwise we can expect a similar situation to Italy (to some degree, they have an older population).  

In order to justify, many people will most likely need a medical excuse at work.   If showing symptoms, take advantage of the drive through locations that are being setup to keep the hospitals and doctors offices themselves from being overwhelmed.

Quarantine will require a couple of weeks worth of supplies.  Buying a months worth of supplies vs going to the store every week is reasonable.  

Buying more than you can use before it expires is bad.  Buying a half a years worth of items that can be shipped to you as needed, is definitely going overboard.",1584218996,fkiftpe

While those numbers might  be right, let’s look at what those numbers actually mean in the U.S. In 2018-2019 there were an estimated 35,520,883 cases of the flu, with 34,157 deaths. While this is terrible, that proportion is (rounding UP) at .001, which is 0.10% rate of death or 1 in 1000 cases.  [CDC] (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html).

For COVID-19: In the U.S., there are currently 3,487 known cases with 62 deaths (so far), which means a proportion of 0.017, or 1.7%, meaning 17 deaths per 1000 cases. And this is just *so far.* [NYTIMES] (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?0p19G=3248)

In China, they have estimated that the death rate is between 3 and 6%. [Lancet] (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30195-X/fulltext)

Even if in some wild world it is actually a conspiracy, the burden is so minimal for those who can practice social distancing for a few weeks to slow the spread.

They thought to stay home, because they'd expressed concern about people going to church sick, and they would never themselves knowingly do that. But someone else-- a child they trusted and a pastor who should have known better-- convinced them it was okay. They don't have Internet service and the accompanying hoard of keyboard warriors to guide them on the path to enlightenment.

I begged them not to go to church because I DON'T FUCKING WANT THEM TO DIE.

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The weatherman replied, ""The Indians are collecting wood like crazy.""

B) Is what you're saying actual science? Or is it a empirical speculation? It sounds like the latter.

C) Comparing the timeline to the same timeline as SK and China is stupid. Firstly, population density-wise, they are much different from the US talkless of the state of Alabama. Secondly, these occurences happened at a time when knowledge about the disease was very new. Since then, there's been more that have been worked on and more progress has been made. Plus those countries poured in 1000% more effort than the American government has in a timely manner.

&gt; This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

Health Canada: [What to do if you're ill.](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#i)

An excerpt from the Health Canada link:
&gt; At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or any natural health products that are authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19.

&gt; Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own. Your health care provider may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

&gt; Consult your health care provider as soon as possible if you are concerned about your symptoms or you have a travel history to a region where severe coronaviruses are known to occur.

&gt; The sooner you consult your health care provider, the better your chances are for recovery.

Some additoinal information from [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-treatment#available-treatment):

&gt;What type of treatment is available for the novel coronavirus?

&gt;There currently isn’t a vaccine against developing COVID-19. Antibiotics are also ineffective because COVID-19 is a viral infection and not bacterial.

&gt;If your symptoms are more severe, supportive treatments may be given by your doctor or at a hospital. This type of treatment may involve:

    fluids to reduce the risk of dehydration
    medication to reduce a fever
    supplemental oxygen in more severe cases 

&gt;People who have a hard time breathing on their own due to COVID-19 may need a respirator.",1584629042,fkxis7x

First of all, laws are already being suspended and liberties in our country are already being temporarily suspended.

&gt;Publix is following guidance from the CDC and does not  recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves  from respiratory illnesses. Publix also follows the Food and Drug  Administration’s Food Code for the use of gloves. Our associates who  work in prepared food environments are required to wear gloves while  performing job duties but associates who don’t work in these  environments should not wear gloves. Good hygiene practices, like  washing hands often with soap and water, are always encouraged.

He takes one look at my friend and points to his belt saying “I like that buckle.” The belt buckle had a confederate flag, so it wasn’t necessarily racist, my friend jus tepee it out of heritage. The man proceeds to say “Wait here a minute, I have something in the house for you.” When he comes out, he hands my friend a little wooden token with the a skull and cross bones on one side along with the year 1866. The other side reads “Make the Klan Great Again.” and “Spring Rally 2020.” He still bought the metal form the guy, but he was invited to a Klan rally nonetheless.

That is why we can tolerate Syria, South America, etc, etc. All of which I probably feel worse for than whatever might befall these folks.

To be fair, there is some level truth to your point of view however minuscule; having said such certainly isn't noble of me but.... 

You are wrong, they chose to be racist assholes, it does not put me on their level nor close to it to wish they be put in their place. 

Hopefully, they will have to rely on a person of color for treatment and ultimately realize how wrong they have been their entire lives.

They obviously require some hard pivot in their lives to come to reality and cease being such an embarrassment to the entirety of the human race.

At the same time, I actually feel bad for them. They have no doubt, on some level, been indoctrinated into these beliefs. Not that they aren't culpable or responsible for their own words and actions but, they are not the point of origin of this racist ideology. 

What I see in them is the failure of the adults during their upbringing and the lack of character surrounding them throughout their entire lives. 

Ultimately, I see the unrealized potential that was squandered, mutilated and molded into this bigoted, racist horseshit that thrives all across this beautiful state... and country for that matter.

I served in our military.  Take that however you will and put whatever reasons you want on me.  I respect our flag and love seeing it.  I also love our freedom of speech relating to it.  

I like being able to tell someone that I don't appreciate seeing our flag drag the ground or be in tatters, but I also defend people's right in this country to kneel during an anthem or to stomp on a flag on the ground.

It pisses me off even more though, seeing that guy on the right waving around the flag, than it does to see someone from another country burning our flag.

That is a pathetic use of our nation's symbol, and he should be ashamed.  It's not a statement of free speech in speaking out against a government he disagrees with...it's using it as a symbol of hate to tell other people they have no right to be here or have a part in our society.

-----

As I said in the beginning, I'm torn.  I love that we have a country where people can express themselves.  I just hate when someone uses that to oppress others.

I try to respect others in a general effort to be a decent human being...but I find myself detesting those people and wishing humiliation and failure on them.

I'm a Christian, and try to practice the love and acceptance that was shown in Jesus' life...but it is so hard not to hate them.

Even the big MAGA supporters on facebook I knew were complaining and wanting them to go home, which I think says something.

I can remember back in around 2010 when about half a dozen klansmen came to Russellville and held a rally on immigration. It was around the same time that a lot of racist Hispanic immigration rhetoric was flying around, and they were trying to stir some of that up. Russellville has a large and present community of immigrants, and the Klan's shit was not flying. 

I remember going down and protesting them, and there were easily twice as many people protesting as there were actual klansmen.",1584865052,fl6eeej

If they are truly laying you off, you will likely lose your insurance unless you do COBRA.  If they are furloughing you, it will depend on the insurer.  When the federal government shuts down during budget standoffs in congress, congress usually writes in a rule that allows insurance coverage BUT the employee must pay the full monthly amount and then be reimbursed when the government reopens.  So suddenly they are without pay and now have a HUGE new bill to pay.  Sure they reimburse eventually, but that's a huge burden in the meantime.  

So, I apologize, but the answer depends on individual situations.  It is very likely that you will lose your insurance coverage unless you take it over with COBRA.  COBRA is a law that allows you to continue your insurance but you pay the full amount.  It is usually prohibitively expensive for most individuals.

The goal of the impeachment was simply to stand up for the principles their voters expect them to stand up for, and once those principles have been violated to force everyone who supports and opposes him to stake out their position for historical record. A follow on effect of that first goal was to expose his supporters to electoral pressure in the hopes that those positions they staked out would be seen as cowardly at best, and corrupt at worst, and perhaps they could flip the senate in 2020. The first goal of the impeachment was simple and obviously a success. The second goal; we’ll see how it plays out but so far the numbers are definitely cause for concern for the GOP.

The Judge’s order was amended later that day (Wednesday) [by Judge Lewis](https://www.waff.com/2020/03/19/virus-could-lead-release-inmates-with-low-bail/) to say:

&gt; Judge Bill Lewis amended the order Wednesday night to require a five-day hold on the release of the inmates for case reviews and objections.

&gt; “In an effort to protect the public on the cases in which are on this Court’s Docket, this Court must balance the safety of the Community with the issues presented by COVID-19. Pursuant to Administrative Orders 10 and 11 issued on March 18, 2020 by Presiding Judge Ben Fuller, all Sheriffs are directed to hold all the Defendants on this Court’s caseload for 5 days. During which time pursuant to Order 11, the Sheriffs and the State shall review the cases and file objections in any cases in which the defendant’s release on bond may pose a danger to the community. This also includes cases involving sex offenders who may be released by this Administrative Order without having established residency that complies with the residency laws for the State of Alabama, The Court will then set all objections for hearing, as it must by law. If there is no objection to a Defendant being released prior to the 5 day hold period the state will notify the Court and the Defendant shall be released based on Administrative Orders 10 and 11,” said Lewis.

Additionally, the post’s article is written for shit so I can’t tell who wrote the following quote, but it again shoots down your argument:

&gt; Judge Fuller said it was not a mass release. He also said many of the crimes listed in the Facebook post *[by CJ Robinson]* are not the type of crimes that would be considered if an inmate fell under the guidelines for release. Fuller said most of the times those crimes would come with higher bonds and the suspects charged in them would be considered a danger to him or herself of others.

Aside in italics are mine.

The most optimistic estimate from the CDC study looked at a case where 0.25% of symptomatic cases died, resulting in 200,000 deaths. That is still higher than the flu.

I don’t know how to judge what is an appropriate reaction to this. Is it justified to shut down the entire country to save 200,000 lives? 2 million lives?

I'm fortunate that I am still open, but only running at about 20% capacity. But here's a taste of what we're going through. 

We just opened a new location and had to pay off a sizeable chunk of debt at the beginning of the year sucking up all our cash reserves. 

It was on because we have an sba loan that in the final stages that all have cash with it. When will that close? Dunno. For the last 7 MONTHS  we've been in this process the answer is always soon. 

So now we list all of our payables and see what we can cut and make calls asking for deferrals. That's going pretty well, except insurance company's. They don't give a fuuuuuuck. So vehicle, liability, health insurance still have to be paid on time or they will cancel it no warnings or questions. And rent, small landlords aren't so apt to play yet. 

So now comes the hardest part. Or 20 employees. We estimate income and work load and make a schedule and try to fit as many people in it as possible. Hoping to god the government comes up with something to help. So now we've got a list of jobs and people that will be laid off. People we care about and work side by side with. But we have a responsibility to our clients and the company to cut costs and fight to stay open. 

Next is debating do we close one location and consolidate to the other? What fresh hell will that cause? 

During all that time trying to stock supplies like tp. Keep ourselves healthy. Worry about our friends and family. And most importantly try to stay optimistic that we will make it out of this even though you've got a gnawing pit in your stomach you can't shake.

Relevant portion of the article:
&gt; Here's why: SARS-CoV-2 is very closely related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which fanned across the globe nearly 20 years ago. Scientists have studied how SARS-CoV differs from SARS-CoV-2 — with several key letter changes in the genetic code. Yet in computer simulations, the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 don't seem to work very well at helping the virus bind to human cells. If scientists had deliberately engineered this virus, they wouldn't have chosen mutations that computer models suggest won't work. But it turns out, nature is smarter than scientists, and the novel coronavirus found a way to mutate that was better — and completely different— from anything scientists could have created, the study found. 

&gt; Another nail in the ""escaped from evil lab"" theory?  The overall molecular structure of this virus is distinct from the known coronaviruses and instead most closely resembles viruses found in bats and pangolins that had been little studied and never known to cause humans any harm. 

&gt; ""If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,"" according to a statement from Scripps.

STIMPSON UNSURE WHEN COVID-19 TEST KITS WILL ARRIVE  
Mar 23, 2020

Mayor Sandy Stimpson had a more pessimistic tone Monday when discussing a shortage of COVID-19 test kits and when Mobile might see large-scale testing efforts begin.

At a press conference at Government Plaza, Stimpson told reporters that Synergy Laboratories, which is set to produce tests for the city’s two planned testing sites, is facing the same shortage in supplies needed to create test kits that other labs are dealing with across the country.

Last week, Stimpson said he anticipated having test kits by April 1, but that now seems to be uncertain.

“They are all trying to find suppliers for whatever they need. They’re at the mercy of suppliers,” Stimpson said. “Almost all suppliers are in a foreign country and many are in places like Italy and China. They’re all waiting on supplies.”

In addition to being unsure of when the Synergy tests will be available, Stimpson said he didn’t know when the Mobile County Health Department would receive test kits through the Alabama Department of Public Health. Previously, MCHD officials have said that test kits they’ve requested for Mobile have been redirected to other states by the federal government.

When the test kits do arrive, Stimpson said he’s unsure how many tests Synergy’s lab will be able to process per day. He said a drive-in test site at The Church of the Highlands in Birmingham had to stop testing because the amount of tests per day was overwhelming the local laboratory it was using.

“We’re in the middle of a supply and demand crisis,” Stimpson said. “If you test too many people, the labs can’t keep up.”

However, Stimpson did say that a loosening of regulations at the federal level will continue to result in more tests being produced. He also said that more private labs are getting involved nationally.

“You will see the private sector step up in ways they’ve never had to before,” Stimpson said.

For now, however, Stimpson said it’s important to let healthcare workers be the first to receive testing and personal protective equipment, like masks and respirators. After healthcare workers, he said, it’s important first responders and other “mission critical” city employees have access. It’s also important to let the elderly, especially those in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, access testing as well.

According to Stimpson, all four local hospitals and two clinics have access to test kits and are testing patients based on a limited set of criteria. The Infirmary Health System and Greater Mobile Urgent Care are also testing by appointment only, though the number of those being tested per day is limited.

The telehealth hotline for Greater Mobile Urgent Care is (251) 633-0123, while a similar hotline for Infirmary Health’s testing sites can be reached at 251-341-CV19 (2819).

11472,lizardtruth_jpeg,"1) yeah, let me call up Taco Bell corporate and ask to speak to someone in charge 

2) Idk if you’re being serious, but please stop with the “flu/car crash” analogy. Here’s your analogy in a way that makes sense and accurately describes the situation: Many car crashes happen every year. That is horrible, not many people care. Does that mean we keep roads open when we can predict many more accidents will occur? If a blizzard hits a major highway and we know that will lead to a large uptick in new crashes, deaths, and hospitalizations, do we say “Gee, car accidents happen all the time, drive safe y’all” or do we close the road and ask folks to stay home? Do we let hospitals get overloaded and have people dying from broken bones and concussions when there’s no way to treat them, or do we try to slow down the rate so we can adequately treat those who are coming, plus those who come in for the average number of car accidents?

You’re absolutely right that many people die every year from things like the flu. The point is, with basic science and math, we know that many **more** people will be sick this year, meaning average resources will not be sufficient and unless that rate is slowed, many will die preventable deaths.

Go look at Italy’s crisis at the moment. That is why we are shutting things down. Hospitals are so full and overworked that it’s come down to letting people die because a healthier patient is more likely to survive and they can’t spare resources for a risky patient. Death panels are real, this is the only time they are used. If you’re 50 with high blood pressure and an otherwise healthy 20 year old needs the same treatment, you die.",1585081261,flebn19

Yeah, there is, that’s why things like the CDC exist. You’re right in concept, but wrong in practice. It would be more dangerous if we released everyone while the virus is still actively spreading, like China is currently doing and Trump is suggesting. The CDC has said repeatedly that we can expect this for another year and a half at best. 

You know how the goal is to slow down the rate of infections? Most of us will get it in some form, mild or severe. That’s a big problem (like we’re currently preparing for) but also a blessing in disguise. Unless it mutates significantly, most of those who are infected (again, many-most people) will develop an immunity to it. They will not spread it, meaning it will not be able to sustain large outbreaks again. 

So yes, you’re absolutely right, that is a huge problem if we all go back to normal in a few weeks. If we follow public health experts’ advise and handle this correctly though... we won’t be back to normal in a few weeks, but better off in the long run.",1585081905,flect1z

It's a popularity contest rarely won by anyone capable enough of affecting any real positive change, and the two party system just encourages division at the expense of recognizing which candidates might actually be willing to compromise and get things done that actually might help things for both sides. 

Politicians are not traditionally known as being the most intelligent of people, they aren't astrophysicists or scientific researchers, so what do you expect? They're all going to make dangus mistakes based on misunderstanding and misrepresented data and information provided to them by their advisors. But that's all beside the point...

This is not a time for us to blame or be divided. As humans affected by a plague we cannot control, are not ready for, and could not have possibly foreseen in enough detail for us to have been ready even if we had, we are all in crisis together. We each have tons of information about this coming directly to us constantly via the internet, it's up to us as individuals what we choose to do with it. 

What I'm suggesting is that It doesn't matter what the government is telling us to do or not do at this point. A homebound law is not going to stop most free people from doing what they wanted regardless anyway. We aren't China, America is not going to waste the time and resources to place armed police in the streets to ensure people are only out for essentials or to go to work. All we can do as constituents is encourage our countrymen to BE SMART and just stay home and wait this s*** out.

If the death rate for this stays at just 2% like it is now and if the projected 40% of the population get infected (projections appear to range between 40 and 60% of total pop, so I'm using the best case projected scenario at the moment)....there are about 330 million people in the US right now per Google. If 40% of the population are affected, about 132 million people, and the death rate stays at 2%....then we are looking at around 2.64 million deaths. Those are akin to war toll numbers, and we as a society haven't seen their likes since WWII.

That death rate percentage is what's got people scared. You are right that most people not in the target demographic will be fine even if they get it, but those with underlying issues may not be.

I’m not going to pat him on the back for congress stopping him...... but most voters frankly won’t care come November if people are generally more healthy and the market has had a chance to recover.

Somehow from that you became not only the arbiter or truth but when when someone’s upset.  I actually do care about the implications of the decisions being made for the election in November.  Trump will most likely be totally fine but I’m not blindly loyal to him or the Dems.

In the version Drs. and epidemiologists are advocating for, here are the basics:

-essential services (grocery, freight, medical, pharmaceutical, etc) are open to the public as needed
-Anyone not going to-and-from work must be going to one of those places. If found not going to those places, they are informed by police that they must return to their home or face a fine

I do think there should be some stipulations to ease some anxiety I see reading through this thread:

1) Everything non-essential is officially closed. Any person that loses a job has in writing from the state gov. that they have the right not to go to work but still get paid. This will be important for step 2.

2) anyone who loses their job can easily apply for unemployment. Since they have writing from the gov., they don’t have to be screwed over by their company. This step will also require a major ramp-up in resources for unemployment so that the website doesn’t crash/phone lines aren’t over-burdened.

3) (this one will be the hardest to implement but) anyone who has lost a job has the right to have their rent/mortgage postponed. I recognize that many leases/mortgages are outside of Alabama jurisdiction, but we have to do something to help ease what is likely the biggest bill everyone faces. Whether the state bands together with other states to help enforce this, or we get some of that sweet Fed cheddar to help not default on loans, whatever.

Fourth, everyone assuming they are at risk is not the same as knowing who is carrying and isolating them completely, as is done in countries that are handling this well.

All I was really pointing out is that Vox intentionally displayed the statistics in a way to make the US look disproportionately worse than the other countries.  I'm not saying we're doing better or worse in responses than other countries, just to provide some better context to the numbers.

We could have (and should have) had a better response and preperation to this.  Stores of (non-perishable, or at least long shelf life) medical items.  Plans for simplified medical items that are too costly to store (or have a shelf life, but are easy to produce).  Better communication systems between the states for reporting this.  Logistic plans for being able to get supplies where they need to go overnight, etc.  Something could have been in place, even if it wasn't perfect it'd have been better than what we had now.

In early November, my cousin found out she was pregnant and was thrilled. Cut to January when she miscarried. She was obviously heartbroken but found out that her appointment to get a D&amp;C would be about two weeks away and cost her a lot of money she frankly didn’t have. 

Her doctor recommended her to go to planned parenthood to get an abortion the next day. She would pay a fraction of the cost and it would be done sooner. 

When she went, the protestors yelled at her and treated her like a monster. 

Imagine if she couldn’t get an abortion and had to wait until her D&amp;C appointment, which would cost her significantly more.

""*Time is our enemy, and each moment that we lose by not preparing for the coming deluge will result in the loss of life and the crippling of our healthcare infrastructure. Hospitals need our immediate help to expand capacity, but it will require an “all hands on deck” approach and the willingness of all involved to make it a priority.

Also - if you've not made much money - there's a good chance you would get money back. For real, if any taxes have been taken out and you made less than 12k - you probably will get a refund. I think they'll refund up to three years back, too. You can also request your information from the IRS for all w2s, 1099s, etc. have been filed to them by employers and businesses and do the taxes.

If you were married on December 31, 2019 - you have to file jointly. It's honestly the best move. You get the most of everything back as married filing jointly. 

Just do them real quick using free online software. It'll be worth it for you.

Also - you don't have to file all back years right now. You can fix that at a later date. Most people in your situation will just bring everything they have to a CPA, sign power of attorney for IRS information to the CPA, and let him/her request the info and do your taxes.

Rural areas don’t have mass transit or major air/sea ports that are pathways for viruses to travel.  This also means rural areas are typically the last to be affected by outbreaks so there is more time to prepare and implement policies that lower the chance of transmission.

12456,lumpsr,"That’s a loaded question, but I’ll try to give my insight into my way of thinking.

“Are restaurants not essential?” The answer is multilayered. For the most part, yes... the foodservice industry is absolutely essential. After a tornado, we’re there to serve meals and help the community. Regular guest has a death in the family/house fire/etc...? We’re there to comfort them. You name the incident or tragedy, your local restaurant is there, ready, willing, and able to assist. The catch is that those events are either a brief moment in time or isolated in their impact. This pandemic is neither.

Right now, the only personnel that should be considered essential are those who either protect lives or save them. Meaning the military, law enforcement, fire, EMTs, hospital staff, and dispatchers of those jobs, as well as those who keep our water and power on. Full stop. No one else is essential right now until we can get a grip on the ever inflating numbers of infection and deaths. Not restaurants, not Lowe’s, not Walmart. The only way to keep people away from others is to shut everything down and let the wave ebb and pass.

Someone in charge, whether it’s the President, Governor, or mayor should come out and say they’re locking it down at 6pm in three days. Gives people time to gather food, medicine, and necessities. After that deadline, people have no reason to be out and about in a public place.

Those who say they can’t afford to cook at home should take the money they were going to give a food place and buy some bread, bologna , and pb&amp;j. I’ve lived off dollar store ramen and mayonnaise sandwiches. It’s not the ideal experience but this too shall pass. 

I say this as a restaurant person who has seen the sheer amount of people coming in to get take out without taking precautions. Touching handles, touching their face, sneezing, everything we get warned to keep from doing. And if one of my crew get sick because we’re deemed essential, that will be heartbreaking.

So no, right now, no one is essential except for those who might save your life one day. Right now, a restaurant shouldn’t even be in the same category as those people. Afterward, we’ll be there, ready to serve you and talk about everything that went on. Be please, just stay home.",1585342600,flop1id

I for one, believe I have mostly the same values of someone like Bernie, but I disagree with the majority of his policy implementations, as I view them as impractical and economically not sound- for example, I am a huge proponent of a carbon tax and dividend to fight climate change, while Bernie wants a GND. 

My reasons for carbon dividends are that they are projected to reduce greenhouse emissions by well above the Paris accords, and will lead us to be carbon free by 2050. At the same time, it is universally backed by economists, would  help address income inequality, and limits the need for massive, often unruly government bureaucracy. 

The wealth tax is another example- I think it’s ridiculous how bad wealth inequality is, and it’s an urgent need to be addressed. The wealth tax however, has been tried in Europe, and it failed. A value added tax is a much more efficient, economically sound proposal that achieves similar goals. 

The trend I see is that Bernie and the far left would tell me I’m a corporate stooge who doesn’t care about the working class, and people like you would abstain from voting for a candidate advocating for these proposals. 

It’s unfortunate to me that many would see these different approaches to tackling pressing issues as a deal breaker, and I would fail the purity tests employed by most of the far left. 

I want to address income inequality. I want to address criminal justice reform. I want to expand healthcare. I want to fight climate change. I want an executive branch not run by a narcissistic psychopath. Doug Jones agrees on all these issues, and he’s quite passionate about criminal justice specifically. 

A Republican challenger passionately believes *none* of these issues exist. That’s why I so adamantly believe that if you describe yourself as left of Bernie, your interests would be well served voting with democrats. 

I’m sorry if this argument makes you feel talked down to- no one should feel that way . If you want to do a protest vote to stick it to the dems, so be it, it’s your right. I just don’t think that is the best way to enact meaningful change over the long term.",1585352521,flp696h

Also things like a healthy diet and exercise help your immune system.

“Increased activity around UAB Hospital and related facilities means parking spaces are even more limited. Parking enforcement remains a priority to ensure handicap spaces, loading zones, and wheelchair access are not impeding by parking violators. Beyond that, the City of Birmingham is still functioning and there could not be a more important time to maintain order with consistent law enforcement measures.”


It should be noted that the hospital employees who have received tickets while working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic were NOT parked illegally, including blocking handicap spaces, loading zones, or wheelchair access. They were parked in actual metered spots around the hospital since their remote lots (for which they pay a monthly parking fee) were closed.",1585365594,flppx3o

If you chose to walk around in public with a loaded gun you are willingly putting lives are risk and will be directly responsible. **Nothing could be more selfish than that**.

&gt; Quinine’s anti-viral properties were the reason the British gave it to their troops abroad.

First, [quinine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine) is an **antimalarial** dug, the bitter-tasting agent tonic water, and used by the British as a prophylaxis against malaria. Malaria is not caused by a virus. It’s also used to treat a similar condition, [babesiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babesiosis), which is also not a virus.

&gt; One guy died from eating aquarium cleaner 

He took chloroquine phosphate, which is also not quinine.

&gt; and now everyone thinks they know more than doctors.

Because doctors are saying not to take the fucking drug outside of clinical trials, from whichever source it originates in. Goddamn. It’s not difficult.

The [French study](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/french-study-finds-anti-malarial-and-antibiotic-combo-could-reduce-covid-19-duration/) indicated it as a *potential* treatment but that further research was necessary. Partly because there were only like 24-40 patients in the study. A later study had 80 patients.

WHO does not recommend taking it outside of a controlled setting. Neither do Dr. Fauci or Dr. Stephen Hahn, Commissioner of the FDA. [Neither does the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html). 

And another small-scale study of hydroxychloroquine in China suggests that [Hydroxychloroquine No Better at Treating Coronavirus Than Conventional Care, Study Suggests](https://www.newsweek.com/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-conventional-care-study-1494176). 

Additionally, Ohio, Utah, Idaho, Texas and Nevada have [all taken steps to limit pharmacists’ ability to fill prescriptions](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/4-more-state-pharmacy-boards-join-ohio-in-curbing-prescriptions-for-experimental-covid-19-drugs.html) for chloroquine, its derivatives, azithromycin, and other antimalarial drugs because of its unproven efficacy against COVID-19, it’s shortage, it’s use for other serious conditions, and its dangerous side effects.

 The drug has promise in vitro. And in a couple of small, uncontrolled studies. It warrants further investigation. But not mass, wide-scale prescription on the option of “internet doctors” [read: you].

Note: both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine can cause prolonged QT rhythm and heart problems. Additionally, both have multiple contraindications in populations where it **should** not be taken. 

In whole, the drug(s) needs further study.",1585407121,flqveoa

And here I go again validating you. My, how the tables have turned. At least this time it’s worthwhile.

My biggest concern with the lack of a statewide shelter-in-place is the willy-nilly designation of “essential” and how many businesses are attempting to provide letters to their employees that they’re essential when it’s obviously not. And it’s a bit of a selfish concern, as well, in that my father, for example, is being sent all over the state to hospitals and businesses, etc. when it’s not essential the work gets done in the next 3 months. And my father isn’t the only one.

There’s a problem with small businesses and employment costs and what not, no holiday on rent/mortgage payments, and health insurance being tied to employment, etc. that needs to be addressed, but that would go alongside a shelter-in-place order in my ideal world.

&gt; I can't trust law enforcement to do a fair and equitable job at it 

No, you can’t, and that’s a larger problem outside of COVID-19. And we shouldn’t do “broken windows” or “social distance” enforcement because of the racial disparity of policing in our cities, this state, or this nation.

12782,strivingtobalance,"This isn't a shock. Conservatives, overall, are incredibly resistant to scientific findings and facts unless it confirms their existing beliefs. Think of how many conservative Alabamians you know that will dismiss any expert opinion that isn't a medical professional providing them care directly.  Look at the beliefs in conspiracy theories (the ""deep state"", Q, etc. ad nauseam) that are rampant among these groups, and their adherence to Trump somehow being a genius in every possible area of knowledge. Look at the lack of being able to abstract their empathy beyond the people they see in front of them. And overall, look at the belief that this world is a temporary, disposable stop as part of their eternal reward. And, of course, they are 100% bought into making money, having money, being wealthy, makes you a superior and better person and smarter that everyone else... unless you don't agree with their view of the world, which in that case somehow you got wealthy through nefarious means (despite the fact that so many conservatives that are wealthy did, in fact, get wealthy through nefarious means).   


I grew up a conservative in Alabama. I'm a white, middle-aged (54) Alabamian who has lived in other places (TN, CA). My education is undergraduate (Philosophy) and my spouse is a PhD in sciences. I am atheist as well. Being born here doesn't necessarily mean you end up attached to these unchanging ideas and resistance to science and expertise. But, giving in to your 'instincts' and 'common sense', the utter base ideas you picked up as a child, and just not considering them from many, many other perspectives (different genders, different races, different religions, different heritage, different genetic backgrounds, etc.), then you're falling into a sort of intellectual laziness that lets you do nothing but just build your entire world view on the sandy foundations of your childhood beliefs. 

And now? Reality has entered the game, and reality is better at the game than anything you believe or *want* to be true. You can pray. You can hunker down. You can man up. You can do all the bullshit things that conservatives say you need to do. You can close your borders. You can blame foreigners. But none of it matters. Reality does not care. You either play by its rules or you die. 

Kay Ivey thinks she can play by the rules of her beliefs in gods and the free market and whatever else it is that she thinks she is doing, but reality gives zero fucks. People will die if you follow that route, and she's ok with that in her head because she believes a thing, the thing being that being a Christian and having god on your side that you are protected, that getting people 'back to work' and putting a temporary band aid on your economy is the equivalent of saving it forever (like putting a band aid on a severed limb and then bleeding to death). 

Reality doesn't care. You can believe all the stupid shit you want. You can make up all the stupid shit you want. Reality doesn't care. And the only areas of human knowledge that can get a reading on that reality, science, research, statistical analysis, etc. are being given secondary status to childhood beliefs. 

You are all in trouble. Reality doesn't care. It doesn't care which god you believe in. It doesn't care which consenting adult you sleep with. It doesn't give two craps about if you are a man who wants to be a woman. It doesn't care if you let your kids use curse words. It doesn't care how much money or power you have. It just doesn't care about all the dumb, stupid things that conservatives care about. 

Downvote all you want, conservatives. Reality doesn't care. If you go out and live your normal life today, you or someone you know will probably die because of you, and you might think god cares about you and them and that situation, which is fine. But reality does not care.",1585413032,flr4w6e

At the same time. Makes litterly no sense and the longer I think about it the more I begin to believe that you are just doing this on purpose because you know people will get upset. And that you know that what you are saying is nonsense. 

I hope that you are joking and don't honestly believe this. If you do please do some research reading from multiple credible sources such as the CDC and confirmed professional doctors. Do the actual numbers yourself, feel free to look at the total infected and total death of the flu and then look at the CLOSED cases from the carona virus. Because those are the only cases where we can be sure if they died or lived because all confirmed cases that have not been CLOSED are still up in the air on if the person will die or not. You can use those numbers to calculate the rough % death rate and then use that percentage and apply it to the total number of people currently infected to get an idea of how many people will die. And you MUST remember that the cases are growing exponentially so that the total number of infected people will probably double in a few days and then double again. (you may want to Google what exponential growth) Every time the number of people who will die will also increase. Could you look those people in the eye and tell that what is being done to reduce peoples deaths is stupid and needs to be stopped because you think the government wants to take control? I couldn't, and I don't think it's fair to elderly who raised us and who kept this country running to tell then that their life don't matter enough for you to just sit down and watch Netflix for a few weeks.

There's always a reason for people being ""weak minded"" and it does not make them lesser.  It shows thier emotional scars, and it shows thier fear, everyone knows fear, some more than others.  

Work on your empathy.  You will be surprised at how many more people look up to you and call you a friend.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Saturday that Japan is now on the brink of a huge jump in cases as it becomes increasingly difficult to trace and keep clusters under control.

""Once infections overshoot, our strategy ... will instantly fall apart,"" Abe warned. ""Under the current situation, we are just barely holding up."" He said a state of emergency is not needed just yet, but that Japan could at any time face a situation as bad as in the United States or Europe.

13246,Nucky76,"Barber, perhaps this has been explained ad nauseam but one more time won’t hurt. 

For right now let’s ignore the mortality rate. Let’s use a different metric, the hospitalization rate. From the CDC, this virus has between 8-12% hospitalization rate. 

The slow speed of incubation combined with lack of vaccine is what makes a highly contagious disease so dangerous. 

So doing simple math on Montgomery area, 300K residents. Let’s suppose we go about our normal lives and continue to congregate and 10% contract within first 2 weeks. That’s 30k with huge virus right now and let’s say 10% need hospitalization. That’s 3000 patients  who need a hospital. Montgomery has roughly around 1000 beds with the 3 major hospitals. 

Just that capacity right there if virus was here for a week on left without infecting anyone would put too much strain on our healthcare system. Now add the reality that this is highly communicable and those 3k hospitalized patients are infecting others.  So you start to see exponential increases. 

All hospitals are overwhelmed, so you now you’re an 8 year old going in for Croup or asthma treatment but what happens? Well all your supplies used for the onslaught of corona there are no croup tents to sit under, all nebulizer medications were used up and now your seasonal mild respiratory conditional has turned to something serious because treatment options are limited. So the point is to slow it down so the hospitals can manage it and healthcare can treat this virus along with everything else they normally treat. 

There is no conspiracy, it’s fucking Mother Nature. How about let’s use our knowledge to help build, fix, or treat and not spew dumb shit theories that do nothing but perpetuate ignorance. I really don’t care if you die for being ignorant but your choices affect others so just please stay home and shut the fuck up with your moronic interpretations of world events.

The tuition price is not merely the cost of classes, it also covers the many other aspects of education that accompany college life on a campus, including access to libraries, study spaces, recreation centers, etc. Since people are no longer getting the full experience they paid for with their tuition, we think it’s fair for the price to be reduced to what bama already believes its online classes are worth.

Yes. Because the distance learning is based on the online model.  What they are doing now is an ad hoc emergency switch. All the costs that you mentioned for libraries, rec centers, study spaces, don't magically go away because they are going online for half a semester.

13397,JennJayBee,"The question of how far can we restrict personal freedom has already been answered in a very similar situation-- Typhoid Mary. She was given the opportunity to voluntarily take precautions, decided not to cooperate, and then died in mandatory quarantine. Personal freedoms are limited by their ability to endanger others, and so a public health crisis is absolutely one of those times where it's appropriate to expect certain limits on those freedoms. Your right to go places and do things as you please ends where someone else's right to not get sick and die begins.

It's probably better if we'd taken an approach similar to what South Korea and Japan did and started testing a whole lot more people. The biggest issue is that we don't know who is carrying it. If we did, we could determine who needed to be quarantined. Businesses wouldn't need to be shut down, and folks could go back to work or play once they got a clear bill of health. But we waited too long, and we didn't start mass producing tests early on the way we should have. People bitched about possible encroachments on freedoms with that approach, too. And so instead of knowing who to quarantine, we're just shutting everything down as if EVERYONE has it.

An extreme view of Libertarianism is that you should have the right to do with your property what you want. I largely agree with this. But let’s say for example, I have a highly successful dairy farm and a kindergarten on my land. I’ve been there for years and people have come to respect my milk’s purity and the safety and health of the kids they leave with my wife.

Let’s say then that you buy 1 acre of land by my farm/kindergarten and turn it into a toxic waste dump and plutonium storage site. Should you have the right to use your land that way if it threatens my livelihood, the health of the community, and the health of children? Most sane people would probably say no. You have a right to use that land as long as you don’t threaten public health, and additionally, you have a right to use your land for a livelihood as long as my established, long-standing value isn’t damaged significantly by your actions. 

This lock-down thing is exactly like that and while you have a right to do what makes you happy, if your happiness directly threatens the lives of others, the state has a right to stop you. It is why we have laws saying you cannot discharge a rifle in a crowded neighborhood. You have a 2nd amendment right to bear arms (thank god), but not to wantonly endanger my life why exercising those rights. It is why we put people in jail for yelling “fire!” in a crowded theater and arrest people who incite a lynch mob to hang someone. There are times where rights are not absolute.

I guess you could go visit a friend, but most people are getting leery of having other folks come in their house. There are no bars or restaurants to go to.

&gt;Evans said only so many labs are allowed to test and if you’re not an FDA lab, you have to send results to the state to have those tests confirmed.

&gt;“That causes a back log, especially with the number of people wanting to be tested,” she said. “Labs and the ADPH are playing catchup, which is why we are lagging in reporting numbers.”

I haven't investigated yet to see exactly what that means, but I'm guessing that, because of the delay in confirmation from the CDC, they are posting deaths reported by hospitals that haven't been confirmed yet as being due to COVID-19 (18) separately from the deaths that have been confirmed (13).

13724,whopperlicious,"The best way to create a budget is to track your actual expenses and/or research how much the things you don’t currently pay should cost. Start a spreadsheet and every day (this is key! You have to make sure it’s all captured, no matter how small) go though any receipts and/or your bank account and make a running total for things like gas, eating out, etc. I suggest doing this at minimum for 3 months to see enough variances but ideally it becomes a habit and you keep it up. I’m a financial planner and this is a great habit to create awareness of spending and where your money actually goes. I can look at my spreadsheets every year and know exactly how much I spent at Christmas and how much I spent on vacation, or eating out, etc. it also helps to plan for replacing things, such as a computer or phone. You know you’ll need a new one one day, so if you go ahead and start “planning” a $10/month category and move that to savings every time you get paid. Same for car upkeep and repairs, etc. you know you’ll need an oil change every so often and things like wiper fluid, etc. make a line item for these things. This is why keeping the spreadsheet for a few months is ideal because you better plan for the infrequent but necessary purchases. 
For the expenses you don’t know, research is your friend. When you do move out, the landlord should be able to tell you how much the utilities typically cost. Ask questions and compare options where needed. 
An online money market account is a great savings account option as you’ll earn a little more interest there vs a traditional bank. 
Regarding rents expenses, ultimately I recommend living at home as long as possible, but if that’s not possible I’d try to aim at keeping your rent to max 25% of your monthly income. The other bills can easily creep up, especially the electric bill during a heat wave. It’s nice to have a little bit of extra fun money budgeted for things that come up like a friends birthday outing, etc.

Assuming 40 hrs per week, likely you'll get paid weekly, you'll bring home ~$390 a week.  Give or take a few bucks.  Ideally, you want to save at least 10 percent per paycheck.  So right off the bat, you're at at $350 per week / $1400 per month.

What are your expenses *now*?  Cel phone?  Car insurance?  Using my son's costs as an example, it's $50 a month-ish for his cel, and $150 a month for his car.  So hypothetically, you're down to $1200 a month.

Solo apartment your power will be about $100 a month.  Water, if it's not included, will be about $40 a month.  It may have gas heat.  

Now you're down to $1050ish a month.

Keep in mind, you haven't bought any food yet.   And  you haven't even rented a place.  Let's assume $400 for an apartment, which is probably not a decent one but don't know where you live.  

Now you're down to $650 a month and you haven't bought any gas for your car or food to put in your belly.  You're not doing terrible at this point in time, but here comes the part people overlook. 

What about any subscriptions that you have?  Netflix ($10)?  Hulu ($10)?  Apple music or spotify ($10)?  Going to assume you have some sort of entertainment, so one video, one music.  So, $20 a month. 

You're down to $630 a month. 

Now, food.  $60 a week ($360 a month).  Gas.  $30 a week ($120 a month).  Total?  $480 a month.

Down to $150 a month left.  Or, $37 bucks left a week to do whatever you want with.

You're not doing completely terrible, especially if you manage to put 10% in savings every paycheck.  

But...

And the important thing to remember, when the economy goes bad, so does construction.  No work?  You don't get paid.  And right now?  Bad time to doing anything.

All responding agencies are entitled to this information. At no point in the dispatch of a 911 call of a medical complaint is a name stated over the radio. Just an address. Which is not protected in PHI.

Perhaps relaying this story to your tenants as one part of letting them know that you're interested in keeping them as tenants and that you value their business and that you're going to help them (and by extension, yourself) help you keep it all together, then you'd be much further down the road toward total honesty.  

If they thought you were a good landlord before, then being more honest with them in these crazy times will cement their loyalty to you, and you'll all come out on top.

 My daughter works in a Hospital in NJ. EVERY patient that walks through the door is presumed to have it. That is the ONLY way to treat this disease. If you do not have masks, shields, gloves and gowns on then you are going to end up infected. Nurses in her Major hospital are about 50% infected and recovered. Because of previous preventative inoculations they have not been hit as hard as regular patients. But they are rotating into quarantine for two weeks at a time when they are taking the test and show up positive. They then can come back and go to work.Probably most of them have already tested positive and are returning to work. This is how this disease works.

The US government built the transcontinental railroad and “tamed the West” by slaughtering the indigenous population. And then the railroads and the West were turned over to businessmen and white folks, creating the Robber Barons and the current status quo. The military was used as an arm of the railroads, encroachment colonialism, and monopoly labor in the plantations of Central and South America.

Sure monopoly busting came shortly afterwards, but WW1 saw an expansion of America as a colonial power, the unfettered greed of the Roaring Twenties and its ultimate collapse, causing devastation for untold millions. From FDR/WW2 through the 60s or so, we had high taxes, high prosperity, and growing social equality. Since then has been a shitshow of “trickle down” economics and stagnant wages for the many. 

I’ve glossed over a lot of US history and skipped many struggles for equal rights, but I don’t even know what “real capitalism” is supposed to look like.

Profit out of highly competitive markets is good as it seeks to promote innovation and a highly competitive workforce. Highly competitive markets are less exploitative. When we have lobbys and ""crony"" capitalism like we have now, you would be correct. But free market capitalism is NOT crony and highly regulated capitalism we have today.",1585833120,fm7ohfd

Unfortunately, he hasn’t done much else well since then. He minimized how serious this was for months so we have a large part of our population who still doesn’t take it seriously. He hasn’t emphasized the importance of social distancing. We have states competing with each other and the federal government for desperately needed medical supplies. Most importantly, he hasn’t united the country and stepped up as a leader during tough times like so many of our past presidents. This country has somehow had amazing presidents during times of need. Hell even George W brought us together after 9/11.

And biggest of all, it doesn't matter if it is only you that doesn't get infected. We are all in this together, and need to prevent as many infections as possible. 

Yes, it would be optimal for the government to simply advise people to stay home, people to actually do it, without enforcement. 

But if people aren't taking said advice, and risking their own lives and others with reckless endangerment, then it is the roll of the government to step in. If you are truly a patriot who is concerned about government overreach and is also a decent human being concerned about the well being of your fellow man, then you should spend your time trying to get people to stay at home. Call friends and family and ask what you can give them so that they can stay at home. Do everything you can to get people to take this seriously so that government overreach isn't required.

You gain $190 over 19 weeks from what you would have under the old amount, but you lose out on $1,855 in difference between 26 weeks @ $265/wk vs 19 weeks @ $275/wk. Assuming that you need the full length of unemployment insurance, and I don’t know the statistics on usage.

Here, a shelter in place order is somewhat difficult because the power of the governor is quite limited compared to most other states. 

Such an order in Alabama is likely to take the current guidelines and grant enforcement powers to the various local entities, municipalities and counties. 

For most people, it means forced seclusion at their home with limited movement ability. It'll mean you can travel for only very narrow reasons, related to food and medicine. For most workers it means mandatory furloughs and staying at home. Right now, we are drafting essential worker letters and having employers put those together for employees. 

These essential workers are going to be quite narrow, related to the vaunted supply chain, security, limited legal work, government, food and pharmacy, and finally banking. 

It isn't clear how enforcement will work exactly. It will of course be handled by local law enforcement, most likely through roadblocks etc. However, the backstop of what exactly a violation will entail is not clear.

""If an asymptomatic employee imposes a self-quarantine because of COVID-19, will they be eligible for unemployment benefits?

Answer: In most cases, no. Unemployment benefits are available to individuals who are totally or partially unemployed due to no fault of their own. In this example, the individual—not the employer—is choosing not to work and, therefore, would be ineligible. However, the facts of each circumstance are important. If the employer allowed this individual to telework, they would not qualify for benefits because they would not be unemployed. If the employer required the individual to stay home but did not offer telework, the individual might be eligible for benefits if they met the monetary and weekly eligibility criteria.""",1585961924,fmd8swa

15081,Boeing_777X,"Saying this as someone who grew up near Birmingham and went to UAH for engineering.

Campus feel. UAH is mostly an on campus social network. People eat and hang out on campus. It was like it’s own little town within huntsville. Very sectioned off. UAB felt more like part of a big city when I toured. If you’re big into football UAB is the only option. As for Hockey, UAH has the only D1 team in the southeast.

Majors. UAH, besides engineering, is big on Science, Nursing (not sure if YOU count this as medical but it’s really a whole different field), and Business. UAB I’m sure is also big on nursing. And I believe they have much better programs for social sciences, liberal arts, and education.

City. I’m going to have a lot more info on Huntsville here. Huntsville is growing much more rapidly than any other part of Alabama. This can be a good and bad thing. Good is an amazing job market (Redstone Arsenal and federal jobs compete with the private market and Research Park), low cost of living, and a growing social scene. Bad is that the low cost of living might not last as long and the roads will have to be expanded greatly over the next decade (they’re currently doing all they can to improve this). As far as Birmingham, the city isn’t growing quite as rapidly but the cost of living is already higher. The job market is still relatively strong but not as diverse. The social scene is strong and the food is some of the best in the country IMO. Huntsville has Monte Sano but Birmingham has Oak Mountain with much nicer biking/hiking trails, BMX track, etc.

IDK if any of this is helpful to you, but I strongly suggest you tour each campus and maybe try to decide what’s important to you about the city. You can always leave but work studies/Coop around campus is always an easy way into any job market.

States will then distribute the funds through unemployment. Trump mentioned this last week in a press conference but also stated that he ""may have to take it back"" because state computer systems are ""antiquated "" and ""45 years old"".  So, as far as I can tell if one is approved for unemployment the extra funds are added to your current unemployment benefits and last for 39 weeks even if your state benefits run out before that.

Whether or not youre a christian, It only takes an ounce of humility to realize that, especially in a time of crisis, the church is essential to many people. Providing online services in a cautious way that doesnt lead to mass gatherings of people in accordance with the HO's guidelines is not at all a bad thing. On a more pragmatic note, the service that the church is providing through volunteers during this crisis is nothing but laudable. Your questions should be directed at other (actual) businesses and institutions that are not providing anything to the public during this crises, or worse, firing employees right and left rather than come out of pocket a bit and find ways to keep their employees paid and working.

There are 5 or 6 other common coronaviruses (coronavirii?) - including the *common cold* - that give a positive test for coronavirus.  But it's not COVID19.  If you recently had a cold or one of the other more common coronavirii, you'll have the antibodies for the virus, but not THE COVID19.

From the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html)

&gt;Common human coronaviruses, including types 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.

On the testing side, from the FDA [website](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2)

&gt;Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.


**TO REPEAT:  if you have recently had a cold, you WILL have coronavirus antibodies.  If you currently have a cold, a test will pick this up as a positive A coronavirus.  It doesn't mean that it IS COVID19, but it will get reported as such.**

Then on the reporting side, anyone that tested positive for a coronavirus is being reported as having died from the coronavirus.  So....which one?

However, in the US we went thru test rationing basically.   Even now some states (such as Alabama) don't accept the primary private test result and thus will only report the infection when they run their own secondary test.   This isn't how other tests (such as flu) work.

All that being said there are some cracks with the system. Especially when the golfers refuse to abide by our grouping restrictions.

Instead of applying for the PPP loan and using that to cover your employees for 2 full months, many companies are taking that money and indirectly using it as investments and other purchases.  So, for example, your employer is taking the PPP money and using it to pay salaries for their employees for the next two months, and using the money they are saving to buy more assets or investments.  By no means am I saying you are ignoring those situations, but these employers are far more dangerous than the Home Depot users.
