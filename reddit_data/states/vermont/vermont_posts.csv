After researching after the stop turns out this cop is quite the celebrity for writing tickets, earning the nickname Ticketmaster. ü§£

https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/7yvysr/ever_gotten_a_traffic_ticket_on_rt_7_while/

I got 62 in a 45 by radar...$165 and 3 points. I was speeding, but the speed limit there is suspect at best ( see article above ). The thing that really bugged me was the pickup with Vermont plates that was going a good 10mph faster right in front of me ( I know this because I he was riding my tail to the point of me pulling on to the shoulder to let him by about 20 seconds before the traffic stop ). 

I don‚Äôt mind paying the ticket, but as a matter of principle I‚Äôd rather fight it and not let this constable continue his cycle unchallenged.

I live very far from Vermont and wouldn‚Äôt be able to return for a court appearance, so wondering what, if any options I have. Has anyone had experience fighting a ticket in this town with this particular cop? üòä",vermont,Mt Tabor speeding ticket from celebrity ticket writer

16,n19htmare,1577949004,eiuzc4,Nan,"First I'd like to apologize in advance for yet another new post on this frequent topic, I've gone through the stickies and have somewhat a good idea what to expect but still have questions. I see other threads recently posted of people moving to VT but I prefer not to hijack their thread, also since I have some particular questions that I don't see answers to.

Moving from San Diego to Burlington area (Essex Junction preferably) around mid-Late January. I'll be working in an office (Federal job in Essex Junction) and I plan on getting a place close to work to minimize my commute. Spouse/2 kids will be joining me in the summer, I'm going alone for now to get settled in and get my prelim job duties/training out of the way. This is a BIG turning point in my life career wise. I'm making a big career change for the long term. Some people will  and have called me dumb for taking a 50% pay cut and moving 3000 miles but I think I am making the right decision for me and my family.

I'll be going there by road in my 4 door full size Sedan. I got some snow chains for now and fairly good tires to get me there..... I'll see the snow tire situation once I'm there. Outside of my clothing, I have a lot of personal items I'd like to take... My computer/monitors/speakers/amps... my Flight Sim items like my Yokes/pedals... I also want to take most of my essential set of tools if I can fit them because I feel I can't part from them.  It's a big empty car, I can fit a good amount I think. I was going to shrink wrap everything to keep things together and water tight...anyone got other ideas? or any advice related to driving 3000 miles! I'm giving myself a week to make the drive. Leaving CA on 1/19.

Me?....I'm a bit of a home body... I like my computers, my games, my music, my speakers/headphones, my retro gaming systems, my flight sim gear etc... my indoor hobbies are enough to  keep me busy.... I'm satisfied being inside the house for long periods but also don't mind going out here and there. I'm not the type that feels the need to be out and about every living minute that I'm not working. But I do plan on exploring the state and not be cocooned at home permanently.

1) Looking for residence advice around Essex Junction/Burlington/Williston etc. I'd like a place to my own...1 BR/Kitchen/Living space etc. Budget 1000-1200... I've seen some places on Craigslist.. around that price, the Utilities seem to be included... is there any better place look once I get there? Reporting to work first week of February.. Giving my self about 7-8 days (probably do extended stay/airbnb for the 1 week) to find a permanent place there, ample time?  As I said earlier, spouse and kids joining later in summer so would like to avoid long term leases unless I find a decent 2 Bedroom place now in that price range.

2) I heard the internet service in Burlington and surrounding cities is not too bad (BT fiber in Burlington) and comcast cable up to 1GB/s available in surrounding cities like South Burlington/Essex junction etc etc. I'm looking at plans for 200mb/s service around  $60 doesn't seem too bad at all. what am I missing here? Also I read no bandwidth caps in VT, true?

3) I've read to buy my winter clothing items once there but I'd like to have at least one set of warm items so I'm not going straight shopping (as I need to find a place to live first).  

Exactly how cold is it indoors? [I bought some well insulated boots](https://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Bugaboot-Omni-Heat-Black-Phoenix/dp/B0787N65ZQ/ref=sr_1_38?dchild=1&amp;keywords=snow+boots+men&amp;qid=1577946106&amp;sr=8-38) and some thermal socks etc... But If I'm leaving home, driving to work and working out of an office. They seem like they'd get uncomfortably warm.... Because they did while I had them on here in my home for 30 minutes. For this situation what do people do? [shoud l I just get waterproof hiking/casual style boots](https://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Newton-Ridge-Waterproof-Hiking/dp/B00KWK8WBW/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;keywords=waterproof+snow+boots+men&amp;qid=1577946194&amp;sr=8-8) for now? for clothing, I've gotten long johns, thermal full body underwear sets. I've got heavy shirts/sweaters, thermal socks, gloves, hats and a windbreaker lined parka (My brothers, who used it when he was snow boarding)..  so layers wise, I think I'm ok....just not sure on shoes. Any other advice? 

4) I've read that support local as much as possible....but I'm a big city boy who's deeply embedded with shopping at big box stores and practically addicted to Amazon ( Bit of a bargain hunter, Slickdeals etc).. is this VERY frowned upon? I understand the importance of supporting local business but with my entry level job/salary, I need to be more mindful of my wallet, but I also don't want to be judged as ""THAT"" guy. I'm fairly handy, I like doing/fixing things on my own..Kinda guy that rather spend the money on tools and do it myself (and learn) than to pay someone.... 

5) I have a CA registered legally owned firearm (9mm pistol) that I'd like to take with me. I know I can transport it in my trunk in a locked case (which I have).... Do I need to do anything special once in VT? I hear/read the laws are pretty lax and dont require registration. Good ranges around that area?

We are not super into hardcore hiking or outdoorsy things but enjoy short hikes/walks (&lt;1mile), cute coffee shops and downtowny areas, good food, great drinks, beaches/beach towns, shopping, and most importantly scenic drives! I collect Hilton honors points so our lodging errs towards a lot of Hampton inns. Current itinerary:

* Fly into Boston, stay 2 nights. I know Boston is worthy of a longer stay but we‚Äôve both been there before. 
* Rent a car and drive up the coast to Portland, stopping along the way in Portsmouth or any other small beach town. 
* **This I where I need advice**‚Äîlooking for somewhere to stay for just 1 night between Portland and Stowe.

* Drive on Route 100 as much as possible up to Stowe, stay 3 nights. Hoping to do a day trip up to smuggler‚Äôs notch, maybe check out Waterbury and/or Montpelier. Any recommendations for places to stay and things to do in Stowe itself?
* Go east toward Burlington, stay 1 night in the Doubletree there. We‚Äôll check out church st and the lake. Then fly out of BTV in the morning.

37,billado_4_VTGov_2020,1578056967,ejf77k,Nan,"Hello r/vermont, my name is Wayne Billado III and I am running for Governor in 2020

Everyday the people of America are subject to a flawed democracy. Public policy has been heavily influenced by corporations and the wealth of the 1%. Both the Vermont constitution and the constitution of the United States of America push the ideal that we should have a government of the people, by the people, for the people. $1 should not equal 1 vote but this is often the case even in little old Vermont. Very rarely are everyday citizens heard when they speak out against changes in legislation, or when they have complaints about current laws, policies or practices. There is no transparency in our government‚Äôs operations, and the bureaucracy is at the mercy of the rich and the super rich. Too often our tax dollars are used to further policy that we oppose. Too often the government is slow to make changes that benefit the 99%.

My hope for the future is a government that adheres to this ideal so simple and so just. My hope for the future is to never hear phrases like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt vote because my vote doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how my taxes are used‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm moving out of Vermont because I can‚Äôt afford to live here‚Äù. There have been too many times when I‚Äôve heard that last phrase from people of all ages and tax brackets in our home state. I believe that changes can be made peacefully to correct the course of our government and show the rest of the world that real change and a government of the people, by the people, for the people is still possible.

I'm running for Governor as an Independent and with a campaign budget of zero dollars. I‚Äôve stacked the odds against myself this way to adhere to my platform: Divorcing money from the success of political campaigns. Doing so will put the power of our public institutions back in line with public interests. Building my platform from there seeks to increase quality and efficiency of public goods as well as public participation in local and state government.

I‚Äôm not a career politician, nor do I want to be. I‚Äôll be honest, I have zero political experience. I like to think of this as my greatest strength: I don't have any bad political habits. I won't make you empty promises. I won't claim to know more than the next candidate. I‚Äôll never use taxpayer money to fund my political campaign, and I‚Äôm not in the pocket of any corporation. Many may see this as a weakness: ‚Äúhow do you plan to accomplish anything if you don‚Äôt understand the inner workings of the state government?‚Äù One habit I do have is surrounding myself with people who have more knowledge about a given subject than I have. I always aim to be in a room where I‚Äôm the least intelligent, in hopes to gain insight. In addition, I have managerial experience which has taught me that with a carefully selected staff my lack of elected seat time will be much less of an issue.

What does it mean to me to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù? It means that I don't believe in this two party system we have. It means I have some left ideas, some right ideas and ideas dead in the middle. It means that I refuse to have my ideas labeled. It means I will listen wholeheartedly to anyone‚Äôs ideas, may they be blue or red. Unfortunately it also means that I lack political backing from a bunch of motivated people. 

It‚Äôs impossible for one person to have a plan to fix any one of the huge issues that the public faces today, especially in Vermont where our governors only have two year terms. It will take most or all of us, working together to affect changes the the public actually wants.

If you‚Äôre still reading this, I appreciate your time and attention.

Here are promises for my campaign that will extend into my administration should I be elected:

1. I will not accept direct donations of money from anyone, I‚Äôm counting on my supporters to go out and spread the word.
2. I will listen to what people have to say, even if I don‚Äôt agree, as any public servant should do.
3. I will never use political attack ads, or any negative advertisements.
4. I will strive for 100% transparency in everything I do for the people.
5. I will always work in the best interest of every resident of this beautiful state we call home.

If you agree with what I‚Äôve said here, all I ask is that you spread the word. If you don‚Äôt, let me know and let‚Äôs talk about it.

I truly appreciate any effort that supports my cause. I will keep everyone informed of any updates to my campaign to the best of my ability. 

Edit: I‚Äôm adding a FAQ section to help clarify my campaign.

The issues important to Vermonters who commented:

1. 2nd amendment/article 16: I‚Äôm against taking away guns and I believe laws restricting types of guns are ineffective. However gun violence is a plague upon our nation and guns do need to be controlled. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong: I don‚Äôt think more gun laws is the answer, we need better enforcement of effective gun laws. Laws like keeping people with metal health issues and felonies from acquiring guns. Laws that make sense. I come from a family that hunts and I‚Äôve been around guns my entire life, and I will uphold the right to bear arms. 

2. The cost of living in Vermont: As I stated in the original post, Vermont is too damn expensive, even for people who don‚Äôt live paycheck to paycheck. I believe that our public institutions have been undermined by corporations. If we support efforts to increase efficiency and availability of public goods like quality education and environmentally sustainable public transportation we can at least justify the higher costs of property in the state.

3. Environmental conservation: The environment will not support the abuses that we as a species subject it to. If you believe global climate change is a hoax or that the earth is flat, I really hope you change. For everyone else: we need to act now or our children and grandchildren will suffer from health issues causes by pollution and climate change.

4. Marijuana: Honestly I don‚Äôt know how Marijuana isn‚Äôt legal yet, how did Massachusetts beat us to it? 

5. The opioid crisis: I have family members who are personally affected by the opioid crisis. This is another issue brought about by a corporation trying to maximize profit by affecting public policy. We can argue what we should do to fix it, but this isn‚Äôt something we can ignore.

6. Bringing more business into the state: Making improvements to our public systems will take construction and administration. Bringing our public goods back to life will create jobs and further my platform of getting more people involved with local and state government.

7. My lack of a website and stances on the above topics and other topics of debate in the state: I hope to have a website soon. I value all the feedback I‚Äôve gotten so far and I hope to see even more involvement from the subreddit.

Thank you.

I am planning to burn some rollover PTO time with a friend later in January doing some backpacking in the Eastern United States. I have a fair bit of backpacking experience, and have done some winter excursions in the Southern Apps with nighttime temps in the teens and 20s. We were jonesing to get 4-5 nights in, and are interested in Vermont. Outside of typical backpacking gear, we have no snow gear like snowshoes, microspikes etc., but are willing to buy/rent some. Does anyone have any recommendations for a trip in Southern Vermont spanning 4-5 days, specifically we're interested in Southern Vermont in the Green Mountains. Willing to stage cars if need be, or do some sort of base camp plan as well. I was hoping for a route that didn't incorporate any crazy summits and ridiculous amounts of snow given our limited experience with Vermont-like winter weather, but am not opposed to encountering some elevation change and breaking a path though some powder if need be. If you think our plan is foolish and that we should just go to the Smoky Mountains (current backup plan), we would also appreciate that advice. Many thanks!",vermont,Winter Backpacking Ideas?

113,billado_4_VTGov_2020,1578579655,ema995,Nan,"Hello again r/vermont,

Someone asked if I could provide more information about myself and what qualities make me a good candidate for Governor. Please see my last post if you missed my announcement about running for Governor in 2020.

I was born in Burlington and I grew up mostly in Georgia VT. My parents were separated and my mom moved around a bunch. I‚Äôve lived part time in many different towns: Swanton, St. Albans, East Berkshire, East Fairfield, Highgate and Essex. I went to Georgia Elementary and Middle School and then Essex High School. I lived in Essex again for a year after graduating and then moved to Burlington. After about a year in Burlington I bought a house in St. Albans where I still currently live. I am 23 years old. My career has mostly been selling car parts. I started at Autozone part time during high school and then left to work at Willie Racines Jeep. When they sold out to Goss Dodge I left for another dealership which is where my career in selling parts ended. I currently work as a parts analyst at Triad Design Service in Williston.

I have a two daughters, my oldest turned 5 last week and my youngest is 3 months.

Just to be clear, the Vermont constitution states only one rule about who may be elected governor: ‚Äú[Candidates] Must have resided in the state for four years ‚Äúnext preceding the day of the election.‚Äù  V.T. Constitution, Chapter II, Section 23.‚Äù

Like many people in Vermont I thought heavily of leaving. There are some of my family members who have moved to states like the Carolinas or Virginia and not just for the better weather. Vermont is stuck a downward spiral. Its a perfect storm: old people are leaving because they can‚Äôt afford to retire here, young people are leaving because they can‚Äôt afford to work or go to school here and middle aged people don‚Äôt want to move here because our education system is subpar and expensive.

I am a strong candidate because I chose to do something about the issues that affect the public good in this state rather than to abandon ship. I abhor the stagnant run of the mill political agendas that always promise to ‚Äúcut taxes‚Äù ‚Äúcreate jobs‚Äù ‚Äúfix healthcare‚Äù and never deliver. I don‚Äôt put bandaids on issues, I get to the source of the problem and fix it. One of the strongest features of my campaign is my grassroots approach. I‚Äôm literally knocking on doors and talking to people about the problems they face in Vermont. I‚Äôm also trying to do the same here on reddit. 

Although I have a working knowledge of how American government is supposed to work, I have no formal experience with government. I‚Äôve been told I should involve myself in local government before trying for this office, but there is an uncertainty for the future that shakes me to my core and drives my urgency: I have kids and I live in Vermont.

After this post I will be starting a series of posts aimed at getting the subreddit talking about issues that we face as a state. I‚Äôll give you my take on the issue and then ask for your view. Thank you all.

‚ÄúBe the change you want to see in the world‚Äù

114,not2daymyfriend,1578583465,emb33i,Nan,"Alright guys, I need some opinions.  I currently have a job that has a house on the property I live in. We are on about 60 acres. This is private property. There has always been a lot of intrest from dog walkers about walking on the property so a group was formed to allow paying members of this group who followed the rules to walk their dogs on the property. I have dogs and I walk the property daily. I recently had a situation where I was walking my dogs and saw someone approaching from a distance and because I had my dogs, I walked off the main path to allow them to pass without interaction and realized it was someone I knew because they called out to me by name. This was a friend. I have walked with this person on a regular basis. I have one dog that is skittish and is not comfortable around new dogs. She knows this. I have gone to great lengths to socialize my dog in controlled environments. After calling me to let me know she was the one coming my way, she called my skittish dog by name. All of my dogs love this person and are very excited to see this person and her dog. Because it was later in the day and the sun was going down I couldn't see that it was more than this person and her dog walking my way. There were people and a dog I did not know with her. After I realized there were strangers around my dog I knew my dog didn't want to be there. I took steps to remove him from the situation. I didn't get there in time and my dog bit the new dog. The dogs were eventually separated and the new dog was taken to the vet. After the altercation I found out that the new dog was not a part of the group that is allowed to be on the property.

It is my opinion that the person I know who called my dog and put him this situation bares some responsibility for the altercation. I am ultimately at fault because it is my dog and he was not under my control. I trusted my friend who knew why I stepped off that path to let them pass.

Financial responsibility: I paid the initial ER bill for the new dog. I am now being asked to pay for additional vet visits for an infected wound.  How far does my responsibility go? I want to be fair, but I feel like my dog was ambushed.

I genuinely felt bad for the new dog and never want to see an animal get hurt. Let me know what you guys think.",vermont,Dogs in Vermont

She and I aren't used to winters like yours, so we're checking out what we'd need (long underwear, avoiding cotton, studded tires,) to survive a real winter. We want to get a better sense of which places would be better for us to settle, but want some information from locals to get us started. 

Here's us: We like wandering through the woods together, and I especially like to sketch and paint outdoors... but we absolutely hate the suburbs. In a perfect place, I'd have the space to garden and keep some chickens. I love baking and cooking with fresh produce, and want close access to farmer's markets, a place with a nearby bakery or other goodies like that. A little night life and human interaction is good, too, but we can handle that being 30 minutes away. We also want to avoid areas liable to flood in a major storm. For my job, I need a decent internet connection. We're also LGBT, one of us of the trans variety, and don't want too much added friction in our lives from frequent negative interactions with intolerant folks.

I have a question for those who are familiar with Western Massachusetts - how would you say it compares to Vermont? Specifically the Pioneer Valley (Northampton) and Berkshire county (Stockbridge, Great Barrington, North Adams). I am a remote worker who has been researching Vermont as a potential place to live before the remote grant was introduced. I am looking for a city/town that has an active fine arts scene, intellectual, environmental, progressive, close proximity to outdoor activities, and a strong sense of community. VT check all the boxes, but so does western MA. The Berkshires offers a similar experience to rural towns in VT (Norwich, VT : Lenox, MA, Woodstock, VT : Stockbridge, MA, Middlebury, VT : Williamstown, MA) while the Pioneer Valley is similar to the larger cities in VT (Burlington/Brattleboro). 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of family/work, when would the towns in VT be a better choice compared to the cities/towns in Western MA?

I like to think of myself as open minded (despite what my 27 year-old son, who loves Eminem says), but this plan does not seem to me to be in the best interest of the whole community. I do appreciate the effort Sam Rutelidge is making towards making the Round Church a progressive place that brings in all members of the community, and I was initially quite excited that such a popular musician was coming to Richmond, but after watching several Youtube videos of Eminem's performances, it is hard to imagine that things won't get damaged in the church. I even saw one where he looked like he was full of an abnormally high level of adrenaline, to the extent that he tore off what looked like a nice shirt (ruining it) and began provocatively mounting a large stuffed pony on stage. Could you imagine this happening to our altar at the round church? Anyhow, sorry for rambling. Just wondering if there could possibly be a better alternative venue in town, like the bandstand or the stage in the gym at CHMS?

### Re: Not Excited About Eminem in Round Church This Summer

The Stone Church in Brattleboro, an architectural treasure on Main Street (a Swedish Congregational edifice with intricate woodwork and stain glass windows of considerable value) has operated for over 5 years as a performance venue for many world-renowned acts breathing life into an otherwise empty space. [Https://stonechurch.com](https://stonechurch.com/)

I have personally seen a lively performance of reggae Master Yellowman there and can attest to the reverence and gratitude of the attendees, indeed the larger community, for having such a beautiful venue. Damage clauses can be written into contracts. In my opinion, it would be foolhardy to miss such an opportunity. As we currently face the challenges of protecting democracy... I reflect that community spaces, like the library, require us to make room for ALL voices...not just the ones that align with our own worldview.

 

### Eminem in the Round Church

I have resisted responding to the post from ""C"" about Eminem holding a concert in the Round Church. Before posting anything, two members of the Historical Sociery Board immediately reached out to Coleen, the individual who first posted about Eminem. Not hearing anything from Coleen as to where she got her information and as to who ""Sam"" is, we can only assume that this a hoax or some sort of joke. Anyway, those of you who are worried can worry no more. The Historical Society has not been approached by anyone about an Eminem concerrt in the Round Church. We love to have concerts in the Round Church during the warm months as it has wonderful accoustics. However, we have strict standars for concerts and any events in the Round Church. It is a fragile building and must be protected.

### Eminem Performing at the Round Church

Personally I think many of you are over reacting. I heard it was going to be an acoustic performance and the MMU chorus group has been asked to back him up. This will be a great opportunity to see the real slim shady!

Hey T I don't know you , but did you hear that Eminem is playing at Richmond flower shop, then he's fronting for Run DMC at Cumberland Farms. Tickets free!!

 

### Can't Wait for Eminem

I don't often say I am shocked and appalled by our community as a whole, which I consider generally wholesome and fun loving. Yet appalled I am at the negativity brought on by Slim Shady's upcoming performance at our proud Round Church. I for one have known for a long time that the greatest rapper of all time would come to Richmond VT to play a secret concert for his true fans in 2020. If others had listened to the Marshall Mathers LP backwards as he intended then you too would have known it 20 years ago!

 

### Eminem Hasn't Toured in the USA in Years

&amp;#x200B;

To officially put to bed the rumor of Eminem touring in Richmond, a quick google search let me know Eminem hasn't preformed anywhere in the U.S. in many years in fact he currently is on a long hiatus from touring at all. As much as the teenager me would have liked to see him preform in concert I think that ship has sailed. Some optimistic fans are hoping this year he will do a rather small tour but that is just optimism and speculation rather than something in the works.

 

### Re: Eminem Performing at Round Church

I was surprised by the volume of feedback generated by my post about the Eminem engagement. I apologize that I haven't answered all of the emails, I was a bit overwhelmed.

This video highlights the reality of what happens when local law enforcement can collaborate with immigration officials. Even in a state like Vermont, such collaboration is happening on a regular basis, resulting in the detention and deportation of our local migrant farmworkers.

Also should we just live in Burlington? We have a good bit of money socked away so we could probably buy a house up to 350k but I'd rather just live in an apartment in a walk able area of on the lake. I also wouldn't be against living near a mountain so I could ski all the time))). 

Any other tips for a newbie in Vermont? I won't lie I'm not that excited about moving to the USA but I am excited to move to Vermont.",vermont,Any immigrants living in Vermont? Moving with my husband next month to Vermont and want to know how life is.

To keep it short -

- Currently, I plan on keeping my first year or two of college cheap and quick... i.e., just getting my gen-eds and prerequisite classes out of the way and then I'm going to transfer to my main school of choice afterward... so reputability and all that matters a little

- Major: Materials Engineering. Neither school has that, but I'm just doing the basic classes so it doesn't really matter. I care more about either school's STEM classes and programs in general

- I plan on commuting to either VT or NVU... so dorm life, parties, the college town, etc. don't really matter to me. If the student population is whack or down or something, or professors are iffy, that of course matters... but other than that, I'm just there to get my credits lol

- Tuition for either would be about the same for me... but

- If I went to Vermont Tech, since I'm commuting, I'd end up w the Johnson/Morrisville, Lyndon, Newport, St. Albans _distance campuses_ (no idea what that means?) - so how are classes in those areas specifically? idk online classes will be clutch

- If I enrolled at NVU, I'd be good for either campus - and the commute would be simpler

- Right now, I'm planning on just going to my local community college. It'd be about half the price total (about ~8-10k difference per year), and it's a shorter commute. Any reason I should choose NVU or VT?

620,vrmtbrguy,1582658952,f9fmvf,Nan,"I'm curious about something. Does your Vermont town require you use yellow trash bags for your garbage? I've lived in Poultney for six years, and a couple years ago, they started handing out 50 yellow trash bags when you buy your transfer station sticker for the year, with extra bags available for $25/25 bags. I realize this had something to do with recycling when it went into effect, but I bag my trash with other trash bags in the kitchen and bathroom, just to put these full bags into the yellow bag I'm required to use. 

Here's my thought, though. With the single use plastic bag ban going into effect (which I support, honestly), it doesn't make sense that I have to put my bagged trash into yet another bag in order to dump it. Yes, the volume of these yellow bags doesn't come even close to the volume of the plastic grocery bags (and the plastic bags from almost everywhere else, too), but it doesn't make sense to me to eliminate the single use trash bags while also requiring our trash bags be put into more trash bags at the same time. 

Are we not supposed to be bagging our trash in other trash bags, only to put these full bags into the provided trash bags? Because I'm not sure what impact this actually has on recycling when my trash is in a white bag inside the yellow bags. It seems counterintuitive to me to be eliminating the single use bags while requiring our full plastic trash bags be put inside more trash bags, too.

695,leavingvtthrow,1583362337,fdldo5,Nan,"Let me preface by saying that it has been my fortune (or misfortune, depending on your point of view) to have ""lived"" in 31 states, meaning that I've spent at least a month's time in any given place. Granted, 15 of those places have been for hardly more than a month and were only for work. Regardless, the transient nature of my job has given me a pretty broad view of the country. I'm used to it at this point: show up, get to know a place as best as you can because there's nothing better to do than try to feel as at home as possible, move on to the next one. 

I just wrapped up 11 months in Vermont and have a bone to pick. Maybe that's not the best way to put it. I want to peacefully offer up some hopefully useful feedback. 

Of all the places I have known Vermont was, in my experience, undoubtedly the most racist. 

No. I did not get robbed for being black. No. No one called me a n-word. No. I did not get pulled over or otherwise hassled by cops for being black. 

On the other hand, I have a strong intuition that nearly all of the hundreds of people with whom I became acquainted would have been in some strange way titiliated had any of the above things occurred-- a seething desire for confirmation bias. WTF? 

A little more context about my point of view: I'm black. I grew up in a small, rural black town in southern Georgia. I grew up poor. Just because I'm now a professional does not mean I grew up ""culturally white."" I was raised largely by my grandmother and my brother is in jail because he did something stupid. Please, don't try to discount my point of view for not being black enough (which happened a few times conversationally for me in VT.) 

I don't make race the focus of every interaction I have with people. Sure, it's a difference, but we have a lot more things in common than in contrast. Neither do I expect that race should never be an acknowledged element of interaction. Sure, we have a lot in common, but we have differences too. Sometimes it's necessary to make sure we understand one another and our cultural backgrounds play a role in that. Sometimes it's just interesting to explore. I'm pretty laid back in that regard and I don't think I have particularly demanding expectations of other people in that way. No big deal, unless it is a deal for whatever reason, in which case lets deal with it. 

Given that Vermont is an almost entirely white state, I would expect that being black would sometimes be a ""deal"" to be dealt with and that's no big deal for me. But I would never have expected to occur what did. 

It seems like a lot of people in Vermont have a misconception about the South, though I don't know why and didn't run into the same issuee in Maine or New Hampshire. People in Vermont seem to be under the impression that the slavery is still going on down south, or at least Jim Crow, that I was essentially a refugee and they were operators on the underground railroad (myself wearing a tie, I had four seperate women offer me in effect a spare room for a few nights after speaking with them for less than 10 mins.)

This is not correct. The South is in some ways segregated and in some ways not. In some aspects of life, like church, cultures tend to be racially homegenous, and in others, like BBQ, they are mixed without anyone caring that they are. Black people and white people each have a lot more interaction with the other race as part of daily life. Aside from the occasional asshole on either side, people get along and everything is fine. For the most part everbody's got it figured out and things are pretty chill. Even in white towns in the South, my race is not an issue for myself or other people.

In VT it very much was but not for the reason I would have expected, which I think is why I'm inspired to take the time to share this in writing. 

I would have expected that people who aren't frequently in contact with black people might be a little thrown off because they don't know much about black people/black people are vaguely unknown/this is unusual, which would have been no problem. 

Conversely, the problem was that people thought they knew more about black people than they did, or that I was black meant a lot more to them than it should have, in a way that left me perceived much more as black than as an individual person. I've experienced that effect to some degree in other places, but never remotely with the same consisentency or outrageous magnitude as I did in Vermont. 

For example, I was asked to pose with people in their selfies a few times in both Burlington and Montpelier pretty much out of the blue like a was a mascot. I had people swoop in to pay for my coffee twice in Brattleboro. Several people invited me over for dinner in a way that was inappropriately premature and kind of insulting because I knew it was only because I was black. Out of context it sounds like I'm complaining about people being friendly/trying to do nice things. But I assure you, in context, there was an almost creepy demanding vibe, a feeling of having a delusional image externally asserted upon you that conceals who you actually are. 

Many of my interactions were polluted by people acting out this kind of heroic sympathy that insisted that I was oppressed. This weird social pressue became so intense that several times I found myself driving off into the country hoping to get away from it all. Fortunately, that worked. I remember showing up at a general store after dark in the NEK. I might have been the first black guy to ever walk in there and understandably the lady at the counter did a double-take. But after we got over that little bump in the road we chatted for 20 mins. She told me about the town and I told her about where I was from. She treated me like a person, not a black person that has some special role to play in your psyche, and that was comparatively refreshing.

In Burlington and Montpelier, I felt like I was in a cage of other people's expectations, totally invisible to them as a self independent of their preconveived ideas about my race. It felt like people were so desperate to ""have a black friend"" and to advertise that to other people that it didn't matter who I was. I feel like that role was forced upon me, that I was being used to build up someone else's self-concept at my own expense. It was really pretty extreme and I'm not particularly sensitive to this sort of thing by nature. 

Why was it like that? I'm not from Vermont so I'm not the person to ask. But I can say that it seemed like there was a such an urgency, a desperation to appear anti-racist, ""woke,"" that that personal identity need was made very much the priority in most interactions I had with people in such a way that there wasn't much interaction, leaving me feeling on the one hand like I may as well have been the long awaited cardboard cutout of ""black guy"" that they needed, and on the other like I was in a bubble and couldn't connect with people on a personal level. 

It seemed like playing the role of ""heroic savior"" was so instrumental to a social standing that people wanted to attain that they were removed from the normal empathy of just being a person talking with another person, and requiring that I am ""someone to be saved"" and not allowing me to be someone independent of that role. 

One time a woman brought up some student loan forgiveness program for black people and I replied that I finished paying mine off a long time ago but thanks. She dug in deeper trying to find another thing she knew about that could help me. I didn't really push back but there isn't anything that I individually need help with at the moment. Her frustration that that was the case kind of turned into a finger wagging lecture about BLM. 

Another time a coworker was in town and we stopped at a bar. Sitting at a table adjacent to an aisle that led to the exit, some guy patted me on the shoulder on his way out while a younger woman, maybe his daughter, smile and made overlong eye-contact. My cooworker asked if I knew those people and I said that I didn't and tried to move past the feeling. When we asked for the check it had already been paid. 

At least twice someone raised the Black Panther fist while looking at me. I'm having dinner right now. Do you want me to put down my fork and reciprocate in the middle of this restaurant while your friend takes a picture and everyone applauds? 

Wow, what a nice thing to do, expect that it feels pretty dehumanizing in a way. I felt kind of humiliated and singled out and exploited. And I don't think it's a good thing. I think the motive to get off on being anti-racist, or paying reparations in whatever way, is self-aggrandizing and insists that black people are equally diminished and I think that's bad for everybody. I think it's forcing a concept of a person onto them in such a way that you can't see the person anymore. It sucks to be that person. 

For what it's worth, I haven't experienced this effect in other places that are homogeneously white, including Montana, Maine and Utah. That makes me think it's you and not me. 

For other black folks who might stumble upon this diatribe, don't be put off altogether. VT is a beautiful state. Leaf season is amazing and the folks in the small towns were great. It was mostly just in Burlington and Montpelier that I found it difficult. You'd probably notice the same thing but I don't think it would be a problem for a weekend trip. But for almost a year it was alienating so I'd think twice about that.

Anyway, I saw the post from the african american gentlemen yesterday and that got me thinking about a few experiences my family had in Vermont and why we chose to leave. I think it's great for there to be dialogue so feel free to respond if you'd like (but please don't be mean! I'm coming from a good place) but also wanted to leave this behind in case others are using the search function as they think about VT as a place for themselves. Here's my two cents! 

First of all on paper at least VT looked liked the ideal place for us and you'd think that we would be a very good fit for the place. Both my husband and I grew up on working farms in upstate Wisconsin. 

We had spent the last several years in a major city and longed for the country. We wanted somewhere we could have our peace and quiet but that was a little more culturally awake than our home towns. When we visited my sister in Boston and did a weekend tour of the state we both fell in love. Quaint villages, space to have a garden, practically unlimited hiking and progressive politics. It was everything we wanted and more! 

We spent the next year planning a move and with now retrospectively heartbreaking enthusiasm pulled it off. We got our 200 year old cape style house on three acres sitting with a creek and life looked promising. There were ancient apple trees and a view when the leaves were down. Moving in in October we were greeted by the smell of woodsmoke from the neighbors house. We're used to winter and were excited about skiing and snow. 

Both my husband and I work from home (I'm an illustrator and he's a custom woodworker who primarily does picture frames for art restoration) so we're used to having to get ourselves out of the house to be sociable, which of course we did. Nonetheless, friends and community were hard to come by. People being slow to warm up isn't new to us. The upper midwest is still pretty Scandinavian like that: quietly friendly, slow to build relationship, but once you do you can't shake em off with a stick.

We were still surprised though. Our kids (1 boy two girls, 4-8 at the time) entered the local school of course and over time we found opportunities to brush shoulders with pretty much all the families in our town through their various events. We're pretty chin up people and were maybe slow to make sense of things, reluctant to see that it wasn't all peaches and roses. It seemed like there were two camps and a pretty built in tension between them- the VT natives and the people from out of state. 

Despite our efforts at being friendly and nice we never really got past the smile and wave stage with the VT natives and frankly got a pretty cold shoulder. They seemed burnt out by newcomers and I don't feel like they were able to distinguish our family from other newcomers that arrived with a different backstory. Sometimes I felt like shouting, I grew up on a farm! I know how to do this too! I'm not here to change things! Alas, they had their own party going on and we weren't invited :(. 

We over time (this is all over three years) became chummy with a group of families, all but one from out of state and life seemed good. We all made friends and found a sense of belonging in our new home. We felt like we had some differing perspectives than our new community but it seemed like we were generally on the same page with most issues and didn't think much about it. That's the way it's supposed to be, right? 

Apparently wrong. I remember it like it was yesterday because the whole thing happened to spark an interesting and thought provoking conversation with husband. Our son's preschool class was scheduled to attend a drag queen story time. Frankly, if it isn't a crime to say so, that prompted feelings in both of us that at first we didn't understand. My husband didn't have much to say about it at first. If anything he thought it was good exposure for our son to have that age. We hadn't had cultural experiences like that and in some ways felt shocked by the big wide world when we went to college. 

I on the other hand had a vague feeling of misgiving. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with drag queens pre se, but why is this THE thing that would be good for my son? I felt in myself a compulsion that I SHOULD be excited about it, but I also felt I didn't really feel that way. 

That brought up a lot thinking about the issue between us. We're as opened minded as anyone and I think in this instance open minded enough to not be totally behind everything put before us just because it's supposed to be cool. The whole occasion kind of prompted us to together develop an opinion in an area where we didn't really have one before. 

It seems to me (or so said my gender studies class in college!) that sex and gender are different but related things. I'm the first person to agree that gender roles are on the one hand a cultural product and on the other, deformed and limiting in our own particular culture. Sex on the other hand is what you are, and the fact that a very small number of people are biologically intersex doesn't change the fact that 99.99% of people are physically either male or female, and that is what they are. 

From that way of thinking, it seems kind of tragic that young people are conditioned by limiting gender roles, and feeling that they've failed to become what they've been expected to become, conclude that the the other gender would suit them better, and so they must have been born in the wrong body. That seems tragic because the same cultural construct that hurt them in the first place, in saying you're supposed to be this but you can't be this, now hurts them again as they seek a solution in requiring that they reject their own physical body to do so. 

Instead it seems to me that we need to go the other way and exceed what gender roles dictate we should be, expand into who we really are. 

But even if we do, gender will remain the history of how we became who we are. That's literally where the word came from-- we are engendered by culture to play a role. Even if we choose a different role, that's how we got to the point of choosing to do so. That I was raised to be a woman in the way my culture understood gender is like growing up in Iowa. That my husband was conditioned by a male gender role is like growing up in Wyoming. That doesn't mean we have to live there forever. It doesn't mean we can't move elsewhere. But it does mean that's where we're from and pretending we're from elsewhere not only doesn't solve the problem, it reinforces it. 

For someone to grow beyond the limitations of their conditioned gender concept and become a more whole person is a great thing. For someone conditioned by the culturally male gender to switch arbitrarily from one gender concept to the other is in one sense delusional, like someone from Iowa saying they're from Wyoming, and in another, reinforces the whole structure of gender roles that is the problem. Can you imagine if someone said I was born in Iowa but identify as being from Wyoming? That's in effect the only thing being said when someone switches their gender, because gender is only a cultural construct, and very different between cultures. 

The solution as I see it, and my husband agreed with me, is that we have to dismantle the artificial division of traits between genders. Our culture says that these are female traits and these are male traits. The issue isn't that someone feels limited by the traits expected of them and prevented from traits of the other gender, so they should switch from one to the other. The issue is that we are taking a beautiful disorganized heap of HUMAN traits and breaking them into two separate camps that prevent the whole expression of individuality for people of either sex. 

As you can see, we put a lot of thought into the question and for better or for worse that's where we ended up. That being the case, we decided that our son should sit this one out. Having tried to create the greatest clarity we could the drag queen concept seemed particularly problematic to me. Here are the worst elements of the culturally constructed concept of female gender, the things that I myself have worked to transcend in my own personal growth, exaggerated as if they were a good thing, casually adopted by men as if that were a good thing. It left a bad taste in my mouth. 

I couldn't find a reason this was a proactively good thing.   

So my son didn't go and instead we went foraging and had a wonderful afternoon together as a family. 

Cue a week later when I was picking my son up from a friend's house. His friends mother, someone I thought who was a friend of mine, asked where we were the other day when the story time was happening and said we missed out. I said all of about 10% of the above just to explain that we thought about it and decided it wasn't for us. It didn't even occur to me to lie and say that he was under the weather or something. I just shared an opinion, one that we had put some effort into creating for ourselves, one that didn't exclude that other people might have other different or even conflicting opinions, and certainly one that was open to hearing others. I could almost feel her blood run cold. 

Until that point between our kids there were at least 3-4 scheduled pick up drop off social events per week for them and usually at least once a week the whole family, including us parents, got out as well. After that our participation in the community dropped off to almost zero. We kept going to official events and a felt a coldness, almost like we were untouchable and that people who we thought were our friends didn't want to be seen with us. Personal invitations came to a halt and the invitations we offered were refused with increasingly awkward excuses. 

It wasn't for several weeks later until we were met with overt hostility did I even realize what was going on. At first I thought there was just a cold going around and then I began to wonder if one of the kids had done something wrong. But we figured it out when my daughter was lectured by the lesbian mother of a classmate when she was waiting to get picked up. This wasn't even someone we personally knew and my daughter didn't even know about the drag time story time event that her brother didn't even go to. 

Everything came into focus when my daughter told me what had happened. We were being shunned! A burst of emotions raced through me. I was angry that someone would speak to my daughter that way. I was angry at my friend for apparently speaking behind my back. If she didn't agree with me why didn't she talk to me about it? I was relieved to at least know what was going on. I laughed through my tears that this was even happening. 

Already long story short, we moved away. VT is spread out and community is important, especially if you're raising a family. If the town you live in turns against you in a really weird and terrible way there's not much you can do except move and it seemed like a bad bet to move to another town in VT only because this had happened. 

My heart still hurts when I think about it. We loved our garden and the woods. We are forward thinking people wanted to raise our kids in a forward thinking community. But I felt like we couldn't afford to be scorned, for our kids to be pushed away from their own friends. 

So in conclusion, a few points to make. From our experience I feel in some respect that a culture of tolerance has become intolerant in VT. I feel like there is a cliqueishness and you're supposed to believe certain things and not believe other things and if you fail to uphold even one of many things you're out for fear that dissent could spoil the whole concept that's holding everyone together. I feel like that's the case because there's a cold civil war in VT, at least in our town. The native Vermonter's had their self concept that defined itself is being not a flatlander. The newcomers had their concept which was exaggerated by not being local a local. My theory is that that polarization left very little room for flexibility in the ideas held by either group and it just so happened that we crossed the line without even realizing that we did. The cost of that was unaffordable for us as a family and I felt too grossed out to try crawling back. 

So that's our sad tale more or less. 

Other more practical things about the place: 

Good:
it's gorgeous 4/5 of the year almost everywhere
it's quiet
there was a huge array of wildlife in and out of our yard, more than where we're from where it was densely field crops
the history, old houses covered bridges
hiking and skiiing
maple syrup

Bad: 
it wasn't colder than we wanted or expected but winter was longer-- depending how you think of winter like 6 months of the year, altitude matters more than we thought
social issues that we just couldn't work around
a pretentiousness not just about money about also in other ways
non-pretentious local people were didn't really warm up to us
our house took a long time to sell 
it's expensive. food/fuel is expensive, taxes, car repairs, etc. 
the few times we needed to call in a tradesmen were difficult-- unprofessional/expensive/didn't do a great job

TLDR, my opinion is that there is a rigid concept in VT that despite our own progressiveness we couldn't conform to without sacrificing our own honesty and we got smacked in the face. We left with hurt feelings and finances. 

FYI to other families shopping around for a place that is both rural and progressive, yes, VT seems like an obvious choice but it didn't work for us in pretty drastic and unexpected ways. There are others if you look harder! : ) Things worked out great for us in the end. Looking back I'm glad it all happened. It helped refine our understanding of who are are. We learned a lot and brought that with us.",vermont,moving to Vermont and why we left

800,Morepropplease,1584143189,fi9b2b,Nan,"I am employed at the main medical center in Burlington. I am curious what everyone else‚Äôs perception is on how this pandemic is being handled here.  Firstly, the hospital continues to tout that patient safety is their top priority. This is disingenuous given what we know about the disease.  To their credit, they have developed appropriate quarantine protocols for patients exhibiting upper respiratory symptoms so far. However, we are all very aware that the virus has an incubation period of about 5 days, probably longer. Thus asymptomatic patients that have not yet exhibited signs of the disease but are contagious are being crammed into waiting rooms for elective and unnecessary visits in both the outpatient and inpatient setting.   This is a big deal in the elderly population where the mortality rate is estimated to be 30% or more. 
Secondly, they continue to perform elective procedures in the OR which poses the same concerns as above. They are also continuing to perform certain cases that require ventilators and ICU beds. We have seen multiple instances elsewhere of the devastating impact when these finite resources are depleted. These resources need to start being reserved for what is to come in the next few weeks. The median time on the ventilator from this virus in some data sets are about 14 days. So running out of vents is a reality when patients are dependent on them for that length of time. 
Although they would never admit it. I am sure the multi million dollar deficit has a part to play in the decision to run the organization business as usual with a few extra precautions thrown in. The sooner they actual bite the bullet and take real actions to contain this virus the better. I hope I am wrong, but I think we are already very behind in keeping this contained and the longer we continue to function at full capacity the more patients (and healthcare workers) will become infected and ultimately lose their lives to this outbreak.",vermont,UVMMC‚Äôs poor containment of coronavirus

Almost everyone at BUHS wants to close to schools, including most staff, because we see how fucking ridiculous the government is treating our lives! There are students who have lung issues, students who have immune system problems, teachers with health problems, OUR PARENTS(including my mother with copd), and home schooling just randomly because Phil Scott says so...NO ONE WILL DO. I rely on my grades and credits, and leaving will require my grades to go down and my teachers not to grade proficiency assignments. 

The schools are a breading zone in Brattleboro and throughout VT, and in VT, we party with kids from the other schools thus potentially transmitting the virus even more from community to community! Many teachers are pissed at the state, and almost every student! If schools were to close, BTW, most all schools are looking into virtual learning thus NOT NEEDING HOME SCHOOLING FROM PARENTS. The school administrations from my school and friends i know from others are not being transparent with us about any of this and shutting down any concerns and ignoring the problem. 

Some people will moan and say that the kids just wanna get out of school.....NO, we don't want to spread a virus and potentially murder loved members of our community and family because our government is acting so irresponsibly and people aren't listening to us like usual. As someone in my chemistry class said, ""what the schools doing is like having an abortion after you gave birth, the baby already was born.""

Alice's adoptive mother Emeline Meaker makes her feelings plain: ""If \[Alice\] had chosen to go off, she might stay; they wouldn't go after her.""

Rumors spread to neighboring Waterbury, where it emerges that Emeline's son Almon purchased strychnine from a drugstore on the evening of Alice's disappearance.

The town intervenes. Duxbury's Town Clerk and Grand Juror approach Deputy Sheriff Frank Atherton and ask him to investigate. It is around 7:00 in the evening when he begins his investigation. By daybreak the next morning he has found a body and made an arrest,

1. Vermont
2. Coronavirus

I have gone through the past 10 days of posts. Anything that doesn't fall into existing Visiting Vermont/Moving to Vermont flairs that seems directly Vermont-related and not potentially coronavirus-related has been tagged with the **Vermont** flair. Anything that seems unambiguously coronavirus-related has been tagged with the **Coronavirus** flair. 

There were a few posts I didn't add flair to. The Visiting Vermont and Moving to Vermont flairs are still being applied.

876,jimmyjoe58,1584407311,fjwaqx,Vermont,"I left the house for the first time since I went to the doctors on Wed. Poor Jeannie‚Äôs down and out, so it was up to me to take the truck and head through the apocalypse to forage for food and supplies at the Price Chopper in Rutland. Driving through the parking lot, I noticed cars, but not a lot of people, there was a scattering of them moving hurriedly to the safety of their vehicles with precious treasure troves of toilet paper, potato chips. A red flag went up as I rounded the bend by TJ Max, there it was, a parking spot up front and it wasn‚Äôt handicapped.
‚ÄôThis is some serious shit going on here.‚Äô I thought to myself.
Making my way from my truck to the store, passing people coming out they eyed me as to see if I was infected. I wanted to stop and point at them, and scream like a scene from Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. But I held back and continued on my quest. Entering the store, it was vacant compared to a normal weekly crowd, sparse shoppers pushing overflowing carts. Conversation was kept to a minimum, only to ask an employee where something or other was. My first contact was with a man who was talking to the produce guy about how everyone had gone crazy. 
He reached up and yanked a bag off the roll. In a very loud voice, he said,‚Äù how am I supposed to open this up if I'm not supposed to lick my fingers.‚Äù
I turned to him and replied. ‚ÄùLick someone else's fingers and let them open it.‚Äù
This brought laughter from the few people around us, he stood there his mouth agape as I turn and walk away. 
Having filled the veggie requirements on my list, I head for the meat department. To my dismay I find the butcher meat counter empty of any and all fresh meat. Needing sweet Italian sausage I wander to the packaged meat cooler, Passing the paper products aisle, noting it is void of anything resembling toilet or paper towels. Finding my sausage, I pick up OJ, milk, creamer for our coffee, things are pretty scarce in that cooler. I'm heading for the deli looking for stick pepperoni, I hate the packaged stuff. Having trouble locating it as it's been moved from the usual resting place. I heard a womans voice behind me. 
‚Äù Oh there it is, I've found it. She said. They‚Äôve moved it.‚Äù
‚Äù Thank you for your help.‚Äù 
I turn to see a man reaching down and picking up a pepperoni stick.
‚ÄùAha! I exclaimed.I‚Äôve been looking for that.‚Äù
He looked at me a bit startled. ‚ÄùWhat the pepperoni?‚Äù
‚Äù Hey man, if you ain't got pepperoni, you ain't got nothing.
He smiled, laughed and walk away. I made my way to the wine section, pick up a couple of bottles just in case. I was actually quite surprised to find that there was lots of beer and wine left. I figured that would be one of the first things to disappear.
Now, what was a surprise, was my trip down the snack aisle, there wasn't a bag of chips to be found, in fact, there was a sign stating that what was left was upfront at the checkout. I manage to scrounge a bag of Snyder's pretzels, looking around to making sure someone else wasn't watching me, I grabbed the pretzels and hid them under the bread. Scurrying past the can goods section, I passed a woman emptying a whole row of canned tomato sauce into her cart. She looked at me as if saying‚Äô back off these are mine. ‚ÄôI just smiled and went around her. Making my way up and down the aisles I reach the butter and cheese coolers. Damn, if they weren't just as empty as the rest of the place. I scarfed up the last Land O Lakes package of butter. Looking for cream cheese and finding none, I am like, ‚ÄùWho the hell hordes cream cheese?‚Äù
Finally making my way to the checkout, I find what I perceive as the shortest line, considering there weren't a lot of folks in line, but those that were had carts with sideboards. I knew this would be awhile. 
Standing there, I can finally look around and take in the happenings around me. I see a few people with masks on, others seem totally oblivious to what's happening. There are couples with babies, others with young children, elderly folks, middle-aged folks, I wondered as I stood there, ‚Äô What are these people thinking about. Are they worried about themselves, their children, their loved ones or are they just going about business as usual.
I haven't felt like this since the day I drove through the empty, deserted streets of Boston on September 11th, 2001 and wondered the same thing.",vermont,Corona

879,coolcatladyclub,1584423037,fjztvw,Vermont,"I‚Äôm born and raised in NYC (suburban area, not Manhattan.) Quality of life here keeps plummeting while the cost of living just keeps getting higher. I‚Äôve gotten more serious about moving out of NY once I finish law school. I‚Äôve heard so many good things about Vermont. I‚Äôve only taken one ski trip there myself but I loved every minute of it. I‚Äôd like to travel there more and get a better feel for life there.

I‚Äôve been researching some pros and cons. I laugh because the cons that other people list are all pros relative to NYC. Somebody said it‚Äôs insane that a one bedroom apartment will run you $1200 in VT. My parents rent out a one bedroom for $1250 here, and it‚Äôs bigger and cheaper than most apartments you‚Äôll find anywhere in the city. Apparently you can get a nice size house in VT for around 375k?

Somebody also said that the road conditions can limit you to 20-30mph in bad weather. That made me laugh and cry because our speed limit here is 25 and there‚Äôs speed cameras every 5 feet.

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund. 

CT - Manchester

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

OH - Cleveland, Perrysburg

ON - Kingston, London

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.). Some are Q&amp;As with famous people, others are stand-up shows with my comedy buddies from our houses. If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

I'm not sure what to do with all this time at home. Maybe I'll go on a vacation. I hear Italy is nice this time of year.

While we regret closing, this is a necessary measure to support social distancing in our community.

In the meantime, we will continue operating online at [**gearx.com**](https://email-gearx.com/3PF0-9ZZ7-67BIV-7X0MS-1/c.aspx) and you can shop with us virtually and safely for gear, clothing, accessories, and gift certificates you may want or need to help get through this unknown time.

We will be spending the next few days assisting our employees in processing this information, preparing the shop for closure, and assessing what aspects of our internal processes will continue during the closure. We will ensure continual health coverage for our staff throughout this closure and will be working to help minimize the impact to everyone‚Äôs income with an ultimate goal of reopening as Vermont‚Äôs premier outdoor outfitter as soon as it is safe to do so.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

They're a family of four, and immigranted here about four years ago (the father and the youngest child are citizens; the mother and older child have legal permanent residence are preparing to take the citizenship exam later this year).

While the kids are billingual and fully fluent, the parents struggle with English and often have trouble expressing more complex thoughts in their nonnative tongues, and are not sure where to look for help or who to ask.

The dad is self-employed. He drives a taxi about 14 hours a day six days a week, and the vast majority of his work is taking people to and from BTV airport. Obviously, he suddenly out of work. They confided in me a couple days ago that they don't know how they'll pay rent and utilities; I know they sometimes struggle to put food on the table, but from what I gather, their situation is going to become dire pretty soon.

They understand they don't qualify for unemployment benefits, but I'm wondering if anyone here might know of any organizations, nonprofits, or state agency.

975,CorneliusCandleberry,1584903429,fn4yag,Nan,"Given: Vermont has an aging population. Nearly 20% of Vermonters are over 65, according to the last census. Seniors are most at risk to die from COVID-19. I worry a lot about my own grandfather, who wears gloves to protect himself while shopping, and is on oxygen part-time to cope with lung issues he's had since he was a kid. I imagine many of you know somebody who is seriously at risk. Until this all blows over, it's safest that they avoid social contact entirely, but they still have to go into public every so often for food and staples.

Given also: We have thousands of stir-crazy zoomers whose schools and colleges have moved online, who are desperate to get out of the house. They are at very low risk of dying from COVID-19, but they must follow social distancing like everyone else, in order to flatten the curve.

I propose putting the zoomers to work statewide to run errands for the boomers.

How I imagine this working is, young folks register to volunteer with their phone number. An elder, or their family member, registers by calling a central number (boomers and web apps don't mix well), reaches a coordinator, and gives their address and phone number. The coordinator(s) will put them in touch with a delivery runner who lives close-by. Elder calls/texts/emails youngster when they need something, youngster goes and buys what they need, drops it off on the porch of the elder, and collects reimbursement + gas money. Now, the oldster has only interacted with one person, and avoided touching infected surfaces. The youngster has gotten themselves out of the house, and maybe received some sage life advice. It doesn't have to be a big time commitment for them, maybe 2-3 hours in a whole week.

The problem is, I can't make this happen myself. I don't have social media skills, financial skills, contacts in high places, good organization, good judgment, or really any skills at all. That's why I'm in engineering school. Here's what I humbly ask for:

1. Someone to convince me this idea is stupid. Yeah, I probably overlooked something important. But please criticize the general concept, not the details, bc I haven't worked out the details
2. To work, this would need to be publicized to the most people possible. Examples: social media, local newspapers, VPR, front porch forum, TV. Anybody with connections in these areas? Gotta get the word out to the old and the young
3. Advice on coordinating people. Is there anybody with existing infrastructure to handle a bunch of calls? Anyone with experience coordinating large numbers of volunteers? What sort of organizational structure is most effective?
4. Advice on payment. Boomers don't have Venmo, but they usually have checkbooks. Is that enough for a payment system? Does it make sense to compensate volunteers for miles driven at the federal rate?
5. Legal advice. I don't speak legalese, but maybe somebody does. I would hope people act honorably during this emergency, and I don't want to deal with paperwork for such a short term thing... but are there any legal traps to avoid?

Full disclosure, I am currently out of state for an internship, for the next month. When I come back I want to do something like this to help my state. I think with Vermont's small size and rural population, there is more need for something like this, and more likelihood of pulling it off, compared to other states. I will devote my free time now to getting this off the ground - since quarantine, all I do is refresh Reddit and wait hopelessly for new memes, anyways.

If people here are genuinely interested, we can move the discussion to Discord or Slack or GroupMe or whatever you like.

I have N95's from working on wood projects this summer and my wife has gloves from coloring her hair.  We didn't purchase anything and we aren't keeping them from doctors by using them. She went shopping yesterday and received all sorts of dirty looks for protecting herself.  


What made me make this post is, I saw quite a few people who seemed to want to protect themselves, but seemed ashamed or affraid of what people might think about them. Or maybe they just don't have it and are ashamed of purchasing some now. Doing things like using lysol wipes or their t-shirt to hold onto cart handles.   


Don't start hoarding PPE obviously, but don't be afraid or ashamed to wear what you have. What we are saying and doing is a recipe for disaster and we should be blaming the greedy hospitals for using all the profits to live lavishly instead of preparing for times like this.

Folks, overpopulation, climate change(soon the hurricanes and forest fires will start again), huge economic injustices, the swarms of bugs eating everything in africa and now into the middle east ....... this now is a turning point in recorded history and atm we are just deer caught in the headlights people.

Americans this past week have been stockpiling up on firearms, specially in new york.

1042,kayeT16,1585193058,fp4c17,Nan,"So it's a long story but I'll try and keep it somewhat brief here.

I signed on to a lease about a year ago, and just two months in to THAT lease, they told us we either needed to agree to a whole other year after that year, or forfeit our right to remain in the apartment at the end of the first period. It kind of felt like a lot of pressure, but I caved and signed on, assuming I would likely stay put.

Well, life happened, and shockingly I needed to move and break the lease. I paid $700 to do so (break the lease), and even paid rent for the month after I was gone (March). I worked really hard to find a replacement, put ads up, and posted online. I finally found a number of people interested. 

Fast forward to a couple of days ago, and a woman signed on and paid her deposit. I was told I was officially set, good to go, etc. 

Fast forward to today- my rental company manager texts me at 10 PM saying that one of my old roommates ""might"" have COVID (not diagnosed but they had some symptoms), that this manager was going to TELL the new roommate that this other roommate likely had it. They then told me I should as a result expect to continue paying the rent in full as they ""doubt anybody will want to move in at this point anyway"".

I'm kind of at a loss here. Not only can I absolutely not afford to pay TWO rents at once right now, but they already told me I was off the hook- they found someone, I was ""all set to go"" per her texts. Now I am \*not\* set to go, and they are going to be not making any efforts to rent out to anyone else, leaving me responsible for the cost? If anyone has any sort of advice on how to proceed, please let me know. I have a lawyer in the family and I mentioned to the manager that this lawyer could help us draft some kind of contingency clause for the lease due to this extenuating event, but she basically flipped out on me, told me not to ""threaten"" her with ""the lawyer card"", and said she ""doesn't want to help me anymore"" (?) I don't know if she meant ""help"" me find a roommate, or if she is essentially planning on discouraging anyone new from moving in at all?

Sorry for the wall of text. I tried to keep it brief but I'm kind of freaking out.",vermont,My old landlord is now saying I need to pay rent after I found a replacement and moved

Vermont has the 2nd highest number of 2nd home owners in the country.  Roughly 17% of all homes owned in Vermont are someones 2nd home. Let that sink in. Nearly a quarter of the homes in Vermont are owned by temporary residents. If homes only had 1 person in them that would be roughly an additional \~110,500  residents. However, we know that's just not the case. They are sometimes bring 5-10 people with them, and we also have people who are using temporary lodging for long term stay.

Our hospitals are built to handle a population of roughly \~650,000 residents. This surge in tourists, 2nd home owners, and people using airbnb's could easily double our population! We simply can't handle this influx and our first few cases were already people from NYC coming up here to ""self quarantine""

These aren't refugees. They are people who are well off, who were ordered to shelter at home, but decided to make a break for it to our little state taking up precious resources that should be going to the people who live and work here every day.

They have shown very little compassion for us and pretty soon our doctors are going to have to make a choice between a 70yo grandmother from Vermont and a 30yo father of 2 from NYC who came up here to ""self quarantine"".

1151,retpada,1585669834,fsfb7e,Vermont,"Hello Vermont!

I think my wife and I are getting closer to deciding we'd like to make the move. I'll provide a little background first.

I'm born and raised New England, but for the past 12 years I've spent 10 of them outside of the region. I can handle the winter and I miss the snow.

My wife is from WA state where we currently live and in the 2 years we spent living in New England she loved everything about Vermont when we'd make weekend trips. 

Montpelier is the area we'd visit and spend the weekend at, so it's the likely candidate for area of the state we'd like to live in.  The very small town nature of it is what we like. Moving to the state very likely depends  on my current job letting me go remote, so that makes commuting irrelevant (something I really want). With being remote that would of course allow me to be anywhere, but Montpelier and towns around it are the preferred area. 

Here's my question for you all. What town in that general area has the best schools? The schools  where we are now are pretty subpar, so this is one of our biggest priorities. One of our kids will be going into 5th grade in the fall and the other is still too young for school. I consistently read that Vermont has fantastic schools, but does one district in that area blow the competition away?  We've seen a few houses in Northfield that we liked, but the elementary school was ranked a 3. Does this seem accurate or is actually a decent school? 

Finding a good school district in that area would be one of the last questions we have, since I've been keeping tabs on this sub for years. Thank you for any suggestions you might have.",vermont,Best town to raise a family around Montpelier

I moved to Vermont three years ago from NYC. I am originally from England and my husband is from NH.  We try to support local businesses whenever possible, I get to know people within my community, I spend a lot of time on FPF and try to give people items for free whenever I have something to get rid of. I have never ever had anyone act rudely to me. The English accent makes it very clear I'm not from around here. Every Vermonter I encounter is welcoming, friendly and generous. 

The comments complaining about Vermonters seem to be aggressive and defensive. If that's how you interact with people I'm not surprised you're getting a chilly reception. If you're complaining about the way people act on Facebook or Reddit...really? People love to be bitchy on the internet, it's ludicrous to denounce the residents of an entire state.

Thank you for writing with your concerns regarding XXXXXXl in XXXXX remaining in operation under the Governor‚Äôs Stay at Home/Stay Safe Executive Order. We are striving each day to provide and update the guidance on the ACCD web site to help businesses decide whether or not they should continue operations based on their services or functions being essential under the Executive Order.
¬†
The State is relying on businesses to respect the Governor‚Äôs Executive Order as well as the health of its employees, their families and the public. To that end, the business guidance on our Agency web site is aimed at achieving the greatest amount of compliance as intended by the Governor‚Äôs Executive Order. For your reference, here is the link:
¬†
https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19-guidance
¬†
More specifically, the Sector Specific guidance for Media is included on this ACCD page:
¬†
https://accd.vermont.gov/content/stay-home-stay-safe-sector-specific-guidance
¬†
The ACCD web site provides a range of information and resources, FAQ‚Äôs, and links to other key information such as the Governor‚Äôs COVID-19 Executive Orders. At this point, compliance with the Governor's Executive Order relies more on self-determination by a business than enforcement by the State. I don't know whether or not they have a strong basis for their decision or on what specific grounds they have decided¬† to continue operating. For now, we are depending on their good faith, but like many aspect of this emergency that posture may change.
¬†
I hope my response helps you better understand our efforts to achieve the critical public health objectives of the Governor‚Äôs Executive Order, Addenda, and Directives.


So it seems to me they are relying on the businesses self determination instead of enforcing the Order.",vermont,Executive Order not enforced for businesses.

1-Placed order and drove up to window .
2-Fast food worker had gloves on which is great for THEM and passed metal bucket forward asking me to put my card or cash in the metal bucket. They reach in bucket with gloved hands, run the card, print out receipt, put both back in metal bucket, and then pass it back for me to reach in. So the metal bin is a petri dish to look out for but understandable and taken care with hand sanitizer/wipes.  
3. The real caution is that I was watching the worker who processed the payment with the gloved hand. They were also filling drinks, snapping lids with gloved hands, grabbing fries and sandwiches and reaching into bag to out the items. The problem is that  everyones foods and drink become coated from gloved hands germs that came from processong payment.
