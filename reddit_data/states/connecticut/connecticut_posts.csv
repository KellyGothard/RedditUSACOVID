Trying to get the message out there but come Christmas time the ‘hungry’ hoards are out in force buying, consuming, consuming..... No thought for anyone else just feeding the greed. Most people have no idea how bloody selfish they are. This is what is and will kill the world. Humanity’s indifference to the suffering of others. They justify it by victim blaming. I spent Christmas hidden away....I cannot stand to watch the almost infinite greed. People behave like Wild half starved pigs. Yeah sure it’s the season of giving and love? I remember years ago my son was about 6 or 7 at the time, leaving the shopping centre (where I’d gone to get a few necessary items) there were cars honking at each other, people sticking the finger up at one another, random swear words flung from cars driving too fast...and my son asks ‘what’s happened? Why is everyone so mad?’ It’s the Christmas spirit I told him’ (He was little at the time so I explained that cranky people hadn’t gotten the magical Christmas spirit) People didn’t even pretend to care for the poor or homeless this year... It is easy to imagine the last dickhead going down with the sinking ship still shouting ‘it’s not climate change, the world was always gonna end’ 

Don’t forget the people who will pretend they weren’t climate deniers all along. And the ones that will say how unclear it all was, and how nobody knew the truth, and how the science was still being debated, and if they only knew they would have been the biggest activist. 

We won't even get the satisfaction of an apology.",Connecticut,Getting the message of climate change out to Connecticut

19,Happyfunperson,1577898013,eikiri,Nan,"• Ordovician–Silurian extinction events: 450–440 million years ago. Two events occurred that killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species. Together they are ranked by many scientists as the second largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct.

 • Late Devonian extinction: 375–360 million years ago. A prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and at least 70% of all species. This extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 million years, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.

 • Permian–Triassic extinction event: 252 million years ago. Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species,including insects). Also known as ""the Great Dying"".

 • Triassic–Jurassic extinction event: 201.3 million years ago at the Triassic–Jurassic transition. About 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species became extinct. Most non-dinosaurian archosaurs, most therapsids, and most of the large amphibians were eliminated, leaving dinosaurs with little terrestrial competition. 

 • Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event: 66 millon years ago. About 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. In the seas all the ammonites, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs disappeared and the percentage of sessile animals (those unable to move about) was reduced to about 33%. All non-avian dinosaurs became extinct during that time. Mammals and birds, the latter descended from theropod dinosaurs, emerged as dominant large land animals.

 • Late Holocene/Anthropocene extinction event: Ongoing. Began with the rise of human civilization approx. 10000 years ago. 

At present, the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the background extinction rate, the historically typical rate of extinction (in terms of the natural evolution of the planet). Additionally, the current rate of extinction is 10 to 100 times higher than in any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of Earth.

The rate of extinction is accelerating. Mammals in particular have suffered such severe losses as the result of human activity that it could take several million years for them to recover. Global wildlife populations have declined 58% since 1970, primarily due to habitat destruction, over-hunting and pollution.

Replacement of natural populations of animals with domesticated types used in food production. Currently, livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). As for birds, 70% are domesticated, such as poultry, whereas only 30% are wild.",Connecticut,State of Connecticut animal species.

I'd like to be more proactive, especially since my land is adjacent to some parks and holdings, and may have more dead trees. There are also some pretty big ones that are very close to the house. The land around my house send to have been generally neglected, and my neighbors don't pay a lot of attention to theirs either.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19yo college sophomore at Fairfield University. Since I got out of highschool I've just kinda been riding the waves, picking up Film Production as a major and career choice simply just to have a direction. I've always liked it, and I've been told that I have natural talent in it, but it's getting less and less exciting and more and more complicated and impractical. I guess I never really considered how much work goes into making a career out of it, but that goes for a lot of things, I guess. Bottom line, I'm not all that down with the pressures and technicality of something I'm not all in on.

Anyway, earlier last year I really fell in love with 90s Rock, and specifically the Big 4 (Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden). Of course, my musical taste is not limited to that, but that's what means the most to me and what I like best. I'd say I'd only really be against genres like rap or electronic music, as it's just not for me.

Where this ties together is simple- I want to be a singer, not a film guy. I know it sounds rushed, but it's been about a year now and my passion has only grown for music, and I just kinda ""know"" it's what I want to do, something I'd be fulfilled doing. Unfortunately,  you can feel the obstacles piling up. It seems that everything is working against me. But I finally found a passion I'd love to die doing. I've been taking online lessons and such to work on my voice, and picked up guitar, but obviously I'm nowhere near anything tangible yet, being as though I only started roughly 6 months ago. I have the motivation, but am having a hard time applying it. FU has vocal lessons, but I'm not sure how good they are and they're out of pocket. 

Some facts you should know are that I've got basically a full ride, so I'm not in debt or anything in any case. Also, FU is really getting on my nerves with the small class sizes, and for the 4th semester in a row I can't take the classes I want as the good ones fill up before I can register. Oh, and I'm basically a massive loser who doesn't have a single friend and hasn't hung out with anyone since I was probably like 12. I have online friends who I've known and met for about 6 years now, one who's also into music, but also wants to be a singer. And he's halfway across the country. Moving would be impractical right now as my mother is very close with me and probably couldn't handle me up and moving, especially with my poor social skills and lack of sufficient finances. I'm probably too dependant on my family to live on my own anyway, maybe if I had someone to move with it would work. I have money, and a job, but definitely not enough.

So, my question is what do you think I should do? My parents are okay with me dropping out, but I'd have no idea where to go from there. I'm not sure if a Music School would be worth my time, or if I can look into interning with studios. I was thinking maybe I try to get some experience as a producer and audio guy, maybe try to find work at a venue or something doing that and see who I meet. Maybe I could meet people to form a band. But in come the obstacles, as I'm into a style I doubt makes much money, especially around here, and I wouldn't know who to talk to and even what to say at venues. Then again, I really don't know anything about the music scene in CT, or about the music industry as a whole, so that's really the basis of my question. I'm not even sure if I can make a living off being an underground rock/punk band, seeing as though it's unlikely to hit the mainstream again anytime soon, if ever. Not that it needs to, or that I'd want it to, but idk how much you can make doing gigs. Of course, I would probably have another job on top of being a musician. Oh, and keep in mind I have minimal and undeveloped talent as a musician right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final questions:** Basically, what should I do? Are there any good music schools nearby (I commute to FU)? What places should I check out to get contacts, or am I even ready for that being that my talent isn't developed yet? Are there any studios or the like that I could intern at to learn audio production? Maybe a good vocal coach (one that doesn't break the bank entirely, though I know I can't have both)? Or, and the most difficult question, am I just being too rash and should keep giving Film a chance, despite FU making my continuing going there unideal (the social part is my fault really, it's a nice school otherwise)?

Yeah, that about sums it up. Kind of a mess, but I know I'm not happy where I am and certainly won't be if I continue on this path. Maybe I'd be happy doing editing or something in Film, but I'd really rather sing. It'd be a lot easier if I had some people to talk to, or even to figure things out with together, but sadly that's not the case.

Thanks for your time.

I would like to interview Connecticut residents who regularly work remotely. I am primarily interested in individuals who are employed by a company and who work from home four or more days a week. The purpose of the study is to explore how remote work impacts/changes aspects of daily work life, such as geographic location decisions, work-day spending patterns, and workspace utilization. The interview can take place over the phone or in-person and will take approximately 45-60 minutes.

276,Happypositiveman,1578865477,enu0dg,Nan,"So, I've been around this sub for a couple years now, however I pretty much have only ever commented, but I wanted to go ahead and make this post as a means to vent. I follow climate sciences and stuff obsessively to the point that it probably isn't healthy, and have for ~4 years. It's been incredible (albeit terrifying..) to see all of these dramatic changes take place in our environment(s), and the speed that those changes have been exponentially accelerating at are really impressive.

Now, what's really kinda freaking me out a little bit lately is how obscenely warm it is right now. I live in the middle of the US East Coast in Connecticut and it's been consistently in the upper 50s to high 60s (touching on 70/71F a few times), with only a couple cold snaps where tempts plummeted to 30-25F for a day or two - which is roughly what winter *should* be this time of year. Now, I know there's been a couple posts lamenting the same thing in here the last few days but I just gotta vent;

I was out at a party the other night with some friends and I went outside around 2am, only to be shook because there were numerous Moths fluttering about the porch lights. We don't typically see moths until spring has already and well started to set in.

Fast forward to yesterday - It was super warm, peaking at 71F. It rained a little bit on and off that evening, and as I'm driving home from work (it's already dark around 6), and once i got on the forested backroads closer to where I live, THERE WERE FROGS. Literally dozens of frogs on the road that I had to do my best to avoid squishing. This is something that's totally normal for late spring and into summer, but in the middle of January? Insanity.

To top that off; I get home and notice that there's two ladybugs that had found their way into my room. One was on my desk and one buzzed from a wall over to a window. Typically Ladybugs don't start showing up until early/mid spring..But again - it's the middle of January.

What terrifies me is that all of these critters are getting confused and emerging super early, and as soon as we get another super cold squabble, they're gonna die. It's patterns like these that contribute to massive losses in insect populations, as well as other small critters. The last few years, these patterns have been becoming steadily more commonplace, but this year is a pretty significant leap from last year. Last year, the most alarming thing were trees budding early, and a few bugs waking up early - but not nearly as widespread as what's going on this year.

I'm just waiting for spring so I can plant my sunflowers again, get my apiary back up, and plant a few more trees. Until then, I'm just trying to distract myself with Minecraft because honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming. You can't even unplug to escape the anxiety for a bit because every damn day is so glaringly ""off"" and has an ominous, almost surreal vibe about them. I know we're living at the twilight of human civilization (barring any sudden miracle geoengineering breakthroughs), and I very well understand the processes at work, and what to expect in my lifetime (I'm 24), however the helplessness and difficulty getting through to family/friends are very disheartening. I've been gradually getting folks in my social circles to come around on climate change being a serious issue - but now the hurdle is getting them to understand exactly how serious and dire the circumstances we find ourselves in are.

It's just a lot! Thanks for reading; I know some folks here get tired of the climate-centric posts, but realistically, the climate crisis is the single most driving factor behind global collapse in our world today. It's absolutely relevant; but I digress.

Take care of yourselves and loved ones, plant a tree (even if you think it's futile), and live your best life. The present is all we ever truly have. Cheers!",Connecticut,Some thoughts about this week in CT

We're working with a realtor and she gave good advice but, for obvious reasons, I obviously want to get as much input data as I can. 

There are two things we're left wondering about those 3 areas:

* What is the diversity like?
* If we ever need to relocate again, how easily will we be able to put our house on rent? I want to assume that Greenwich will rent easier cause it is closer to NYC. We like houses in New Canaan and Darien more so we're wondering if those areas would rent just as well.

Some time ago I was looking at a map of [Connecticut's Blue Blazed Trails](https://cfpa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=1a3d7ab1bb914c4a86417360abaa7c41&amp;extent=-73.7082,41.2162,-71.6799,42.0609&amp;zoom=true&amp;scale=true&amp;search=true&amp;searchextent=true&amp;legendlayers=true&amp;basemap_gallery=true&amp;disable_scroll=true&amp;theme=light) and realized this would be possible. Starting in Guilford, you can follow the Menunkatuck Trail, the Mattabesett Trail, and the Metacomet Trail to the state line. Better yet, this directly connects with the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, which in turn connects to the Monadnock-Sunapee Trail, so you could feasibly start a 400-mile hike here.

When someone with a permit goes to take the test for their license at the DMV, is there still a written portion prior to the driving portion?? I keep looking for practice tests online to share with a relative and am only finding them for the permit test. Everything online (including the DMV website) keeps referencing the road test only.

Back when I took it (\~20 years ago), I remember there being a written test prior to the road test portion AND that if you failed that written portion, you weren't allowed out for the road test.

I’d like to remain within 25 minutes of Salem, but if the benefits of a little further are large I’m open to anywhere less than an hour. I know this is a more small town area, but if there’s somewhere around with a more city vibe that’s where I’d want to be. 

I love breweries, live music, and good food. I like nightlife, but a crowded brewery can usually fill that need if more exciting nightlife isn’t available.  Most importantly I like having options for things to do during my days off, love fairs and festivals and things like that. I like to run on trails with my pup weather permitting, but otherwise outdoors stuff isn’t majorly important to me.

We've clearly passed multiple tipping points, the weather is dramatically shifting, and from what I can see: society is utterly fucked, and getting more fucked on a daily basis.

There's so many other horrible things happening around the world that it just makes absolutely no sense to me to focus on a career.

The only thing that helps me sleep at night, more often than not, is that I have no children and money in the bank - so if I lose my job I can just coast for several years before needing to try to re-enter the job market. Since I live with family, I can get away with minimum wage and I'd be OK. Plenty of minimum wage jobs around here, none of them are good - but if it means I can stay unemployed for 5 years before having to have a go at it again, then so be it.

The company I work for has employees sacrificing their personal lives to enhance ""company growth"", and I find it disgusting to imagine that a company would be interested in expanding at this point in our situation.

Yet, I see companies building new storefronts, new buildings being constructed - I have zero interest in participating in such a spectacle, unless it means I can do less work for more money. 

I honestly envy the boomers - they can just cruise on their fat social security and pensions, not have to work while the younger generations sacrifice themselves to contribute to social security and the ""economy"".

Our entire society is run by baby boomers - from the president, to the local congressmen and senators. The old people who purposely chose to do absolutely nothing to improve the climate, are now the ones choosing the future of all of the youth on the planet - by continuing to do nothing right to their graves, just business as usual. Many of these senators and congressmen have been in office long enough to actually do something about the climate - yet no. Nothing. Still there making lots of $$$, absolutely no interest in addressing any climate issues (or even acknowledging it).

461,Joytomyworld,1579468455,er2ezy,Nan,"States are always bound to external conditions that make their existence in a certain form possible in the first place. So in order to imagine a state of the future, one must first imagine what these conditions will look like in the future. In the future, one big factor will be decisive: sustainability. The term presupposes development with a view to the future, so it will not happen at the expense of that future. Examples of unsustainable development are the use of fossil fuels for energy production, the consumption of irreplaceable resources of the earth and the progressive destruction of the ecosystem of our planet, which makes our life possible in the first place. All this is happening today as fast as never before, and with an ever-increasing speed. The social and economic mentality that exists today, which is often described as that of a consumer society, is anything but sustainable and is thus abolishing itself. The price of sustainable development (or at least long-term development, since sustainability as such cannot exist) is above all the renunciation of immediate profit. It can be found in very many human behaviours - it is expressed in saving money, in the desire for higher education or qualifications and also in the desire to have children. In the medium term, all these things mean investing resources for long-term profit, whether in the form of a well-paid job or a happy family.

This principle of renunciation seems obvious on a personal level. But on a social level it is no longer individual psychology that plays a role, but a kind of mass psychology, especially in democratic systems. This manifests itself in the blurring of the boundaries of one's own responsibility and all too often in the forgetting of this principle. However, since humanity has already reached such a scale and is able to influence its environment as never before (so far only in a negative way), one has no choice but to take on this responsibility. Notwithstanding such social movements now emerging to protect nature (which in the broadest sense means protecting mankind), the crucial facts are that the emission of greenhouse gases is still increasing year after year, as is the consumption of limited earth's resources, while the burden on the environment is becoming extreme and growing. No doubt very serious measures are needed to stop this - after all, it has all been neglected over many decades. And yet, thanks in part to modern media society, any meaningful measures degenerate into little more than media-effective campaigns. This happens because real measures are not compatible with the existing social model and inevitably have to be unpopular. Consumer-oriented wishful thinking is electable, but the problem cannot be solved in this way.

Humanity thus comes up against limits that can be very objectively measured and are not up for negotiation - either it acts or it disappears. And so every state of the future, if it exists, must also recognize these limits and develop accordingly. Can it be a democracy? Perhaps. But only if a majority of the people become aware of the extent of the dangers and are prepared to accept economic and political renunciation. But what then appears as a possible reduction of personal freedom is in reality only its return to a meaningful framework - where the freedom of the other person begins. No consumer today can live within this framework, because his actions are increasingly polluting the environment at the expense of the whole society. So it is not only necessary to voluntarily turn away from a harmful way of life - such a way of life must not be allowed in the first place. Just as it is not allowed to commit murder. However, based on my experience and my own observations, I believe that our society in its present form will not be able to collectively impose such a self-restriction. Who would vote to ban cars? Who would advocate halving their own income or would like to not be allowed to fly? One's own short-term interest triumphs almost always, especially in our consumer-oriented society.

For this reason, my idea of a future state is also completely different from today's reality. It is called the concept of technocracy. In this concept, important decisions are made exclusively by persons qualified in the respective field, who embody the legislative and optionally also the executive branches in the sense of the current separation of powers. These so-called technocrats derive their legitimacy not from public approval but from the rationality of their decisions. It is impossible to prevent the radical confrontation with environmental issues, and qualified people are by far the best at dealing with them. A possible concept of such a future state, which comes to my mind relatively spontaneously, is based on such a system of government - all relevant sectors of energy, resources, education, economy, the state budget and research are subject to extensive councils of qualified scientists, academics, psychologists, sociologists, etc. These councils are not exposed to such irrational complications as the election campaign, democratic populism, government formation problems, etc. They can thus most effectively facilitate sustainable development. Meanwhile, democracy continues to function at the level of local self-government, at the level of culture, microeconomics and possibly also at the level of the media. A technocratic government must have an optimal degree of decentralisation and protective mechanisms to prevent the formation of unforeseen centres of power (i.e. a potential non-technocratic takeover). In this state, human rights are of course fully recognised, and reason and humanity are characteristic features of that state. However, individual freedoms in this state are restricted in that they must not undermine the very basis of society's existence in any way - just like in our society. In concrete terms this means, for example, a rapid ban on fossil fuels and numerous bans on the inefficient use of the existing resources of the state itself and the world (insofar as it is not a world state). A person can freely develop his or her personality in this state, but the state creates certain guidelines and makes recommendations to the individual, for example for certain professions of benefit to the public. To participate in the technocratic government, however, one must be highly qualified - just as for a pilot career one must also have a pilot's license and the extensive flying experience that goes with it. Determining the future of a society is much more difficult than that.

As long as mankind had seemingly infinite resources and energy sources at its disposal, it did not seem relevant how to deal with them. In politics, therefore, the outdated misconception persists that reality is somehow subject to political convictions and can be freely chosen. A state of the future must accept the conditions of reality and not put them up for discussion. It may perhaps appear that such a state would have less legitimacy from today's perspective. But in this case one can already ask the counter question: What legitimacy can the current system have, when it threatens to end the very existence of humanity? I believe that it can have none at all.",Connecticut,Is CT future ready?

491,OneLeggedOctopus,1579591116,err6vv,Nan,"**TL;DR**: I made a stupid mistake that ended my career, the only help I want is in finding gainful employment (ideally something that involves JavaScript because I'm pretty good at it). 

# A bit about me: 

**Mistakes**: I don't want to go into too many details about the situation that ended my career, because there are contractual restrictions that I'm under about talking about it and if this post leads to a productive connection I would end up violating that contract. This situation is also making job interviews tricky as I've had to sit there unemployed and explain why I left my previous employer – my best response is that I'm looking for a career change, but I can tell that doesn't sit well because it would be pretty foolish to quit a career before securing the new one. What I will say is that I did nothing illegal and my performance on the job was excellent and my former boss and co-workers would attest to this if contacted. Nevertheless, I definitely fucked up and I have gone from making about $70k/yr salary to not even getting call-backs from minimum wage jobs that I apply to (I've applied for hundreds of jobs on multiple different job sites, and I've signed up with one of those 'temp agencies' – all with zero results). 

**More mistakes**: I have been looking for work for a year now, and have spent a lot of time and money exploring my options. Day one of unemployment I started to learn how to code on freecodecamp. I did hundreds of their exercises and was getting through them with ease. I learned the basics of ReactJS and built a couple of small web apps and a couple of simple mobile apps to throw in my portfolio. Then I started looking for entry-level jobs and they all had laundry lists of technologies that were required and they all wanted multiple years of experience in those specific technologies. I got super discouraged. I started to scan job boards for literally any job. And that took me down the path of insurance sales. I took a course and a test to get certified with the state to sell insurance, then I spent a couple months trying to make money. The cash flow was negative. I had to pay for leads, gas, and supplies and wasn't making nearly enough in sales to cover it. I'd be happy to answer a few questions about insurance sales jobs if anyone is considering this an option for themselves. Then I signed up for all of the food delivery services (e.g., DoorDash, PostMates, GrubHub). But I don't live in an active area, so to work I have to drive 30 minutes each way to get to a hot spot, and worry about the work I do paying for gas and maintenance (I seem to average about $8/hr after gas ... oh and I have to pay taxes on that later). Finally, and most recently, I've been lured back to the idea of coding for a career. And I found this place called ""Revature"", and what they presented sounded like a reasonable deal for somebody in a desperate situation like myself. But the more I read about it, the more I'm feeling like I'm about to make a huge mistake. I just finished their free, online, no commitment program (""spark"") and now I have to decide if I want to go do their on-site training. There will be a 2-year contract to sign which will bind me to working for either $8/hr if I'm not working for one of their clients or to about $25/hr if I am working for one of their clients. They can re-locate me anywhere in the US as often as they want and not have to pay me more than $500 to help me move (a joke of a number if you've ever moved). The idea is that this will give me the knowledge and experience to put on a resume two years from now, but it will require me moving out of state, away from my daughter (who is in grade school and who would not be happy at all if I were to leave for two years) and probably spending a lot of time not making enough money to survive. 

**Depression**: I've struggled with depression my entire adult life. I never wanted to take medication for it and I still don't, the closest I came to getting professional help was going to a therapist a few times but I never found it helpful and I never wanted to go to the next level and get medicated. In my personal/private time my depression can often consume me, but in public I'm very functional: I am great at doing what I'm told – I have a strong sense of social accountability. If somebody is expecting me to arrive to work, I arrive to work. If somebody is expecting me to complete a task for them, I complete the task. I am respectful towards others and I am a productive and efficient worker. I do see myself as a great employee for anyone to have. The reason I explain this, is because I think a lot of replies might suggest I start my own business. I've thought about it a lot, and I know myself well enough to know that I don't have the psychological/emotional skill set to run my own business. What I'm good at and what I want, is to be an employee. A person who is given tasks to complete in exchange for predictable paychecks. 

**Another point about depression**: I'm extraordinarily introverted (again, I will talk to co-workers and clients without trouble or awkwardness), I have zero friends and only a couple family members who live in Connecticut. This has created, what I think is my biggest roadblock to finding employment: I have zero connections to people who can help me. That's why I'm reaching out here. What I need is a connection, a foot in the door somewhere, with someone. Somebody willing to give me a chance without me being their cousin's fiance or their best friend's brother. This is my greatest personal weakness, I don't crave friendships, I don't seek out friendships, and so I have become completely detached from those who can help me when I need help. 

**Health**: I'm overweight, but for most of my life I've been very lucky to not have any health problems. The worst thing that happened to me is I got pneumonia once. But of course as soon as I lost my job and my health insurance, I started having some problems with my foot. I only point this out here because I'd otherwise be open to light manual labor, but I am really going to struggle at a job that requires me to be on my feet all day. But I've never been a manual labor person anyway, I much prefer cognitive work.

Demographics: I kind of feel like this post is a job application, so I'll answer the common demographics questions: I'm almost 40, not disabled, Caucasian, not a veteran, and I am a US citizen (born in the US, lived here my whole life).

# Skills

Compared to a professional web developer, all of my coding skills are probably mediocre, but below is a list of things I can do and how well I think I can do them. 

* HTML: html is simple, I know the fundamentals well and I know how to figure out the stuff I don't 	know.
* CSS: I know the fundamentals well 	and I have occasionally used media queries, variables, and 	transitions 
* JavaScript: I have written many personal projects in JavaScript. I enjoy thinking through programming problems. I know the fundamentals of OOP in general and how to implement them in JS. I also learned the very basics of ReactJS and created a few personal projects using React. I even ported one of them to ReactNative and made an Android app (plus another very simple Android app that was just written from scratch in ReactNative). I'll emphasize, I really like working in JavaScript 
* Java: I know the very basics of Java, I've used the Eclipse IDE and written a few very simple personal projects 
* Git: I know the basics, I've used git and github for several personal projects 
* Typing: 90wpm 
* Computers in general: I'm very good with computers, I build my own, I run my own home network with a media server, I'm proficient in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop. I can learn new software titles quickly and I find user interfaces for most applications to be intuitive 
* Soft skills: I'm organized, conscientious, and I take pride in the work that I do. I'm not outgoing, but I'm professional and respectful with colleagues and clients

**Location**: I live in the Glastonbury area, an ideal commute would be less than 30 minutes from Glastonbury, and unless the pay makes it worth the time and expense of the commute, I'd be hesitant to consider anything too far outside of that range. 

**Hours**: I can basically work any hours, but I would hope to have something compatible with seeing my kid on weekends/nights. I am divorced and have shared custody, so I can re-arrange that schedule as needed, but wouldn't want to work all nights plus weekends. 

**What I want**: All I really want is a long-term/permanent job that pays at least $18/hr. However, I'd be willing to agree to work for less if I was on a clear and short path to earning more. I'm willing to study after work to learn how to do what you want me to do. My ideal job is one that involves coding, as I enjoy it and have some of the base skills and knowledge in place. However, I think I'd also do well in any kind of general office work role. I'm running out of time and money, I have a mortgage to pay and a kid to feed. If I can't find anything, I'm probably going to sign the next two years of my life over to Revature and probably have to sell my house and not see my kid more than a few days a year. I need somebody to give me a chance.

I do not want to be stuck in a room full of only females oohing and awwing over every little thing. Plus I don’t do well with attention being focused on me. I want to have my husband involved because it’s his kid too!

The best place we found was Stony Creek but the cost would have been $1300 to rent the upstairs room and pay for $700 of booze up front. We’re looking for a place that will allow our party members to pay for what they want in terms of alcohol. We had an open bar at our wedding, been there, done that.

510,TheK0ntrarian,1579642087,es1dqm,Nan,"   Thank you for your message regarding marijuana.  I appreciate hearing from you.  The regulation of marijuana is a sensitive issue, and I respect the deeply-held views of individuals on both sides of this debate.

     I have received cogent and persuasive evidence of such risks from experts, parents, and others. As a result, I have strong concerns about proposals to legalize drugs that pose serious health risks to users.  However, I believe we must rethink the nature of the current federal prohibition on marijuana, and I will closely consider current congressional proposals on this topic.

     As you know, the possession, sale, and use of marijuana is currently illegal under federal law.  However, more than half of states, including Connecticut, have passed laws allowing marijuana to be possessed, sold, and used under certain circumstances.  Because the enforcement of drug laws is largely conducted by state and local law enforcement officials who implement state and local laws, individuals in states like Connecticut may be able to possess, sell, or use marijuana in compliance with state and local law, despite federal laws on marijuana.  I believe it is important for states to serve as “laboratories of democracy” in order to help the federal government design policies that would work best for our entire nation.  Certain proposed bills would allow states to continue implementing marijuana-related legislation without federal interference.

     Under President Obama, federal law enforcement agencies deprioritized investigating small-scale individual marijuana users.  At the start of 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded this policy.  This decision creates uncertainty and misallocates resources away from important priorities, including the opioid epidemic devastating our communities.  This decision also fails to respect state-level decisions made in states like Connecticut, which has legalized marijuana for medical usage and has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana.  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to monitor this issue.

     If I have the opportunity to vote on legislation related to the legalization of marijuana, I will be sure to keep your views in mind.",Connecticut,A response from Blumenthal about cannabis legalization

536,TheK0ntrarian,1579734321,esjw4f,Nan,"Thank you for contacting me regarding marijuana. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this important matter.

In recent years, medical professionals have identified many positive uses of medicinal marijuana, including pain control, nausea, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and glaucoma. Additionally, CBD oil, an extract from hemp without any THC (the chemical that causes the “high” that goes along with marijuana consumption), has been found to help patients relieve insomnia, anxiety, pain, and even epilepsy.

For these reasons, many states, including Connecticut, have legalized medicinal marijuana and industrial hemp. I believe that patients deserve access to medicinal marijuana as a way to treat their chronic pain, PTSD, or other conditions. In speaking with veterans across my district, I have also learned that medicinal marijuana is particularly helpful for veterans suffering from PTSD. That is why I cosponsored H.R. 712, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2019, which would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to research medicinal uses of marijuana for veterans. 

No less importantly, we now know that the criminalization of marijuana has had a disproportionate impact on Americans of color. While all Americans are found to use marijuana recreationally at equal rates, African-Americans are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white neighbors. Please know that I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make progress on this critical issue and will keep your thoughts in mind should legislation relating to marijuana come to the floor of the House.

January 25**](https://gardearts.org/)  
*Stung by a string of showbiz failures, floundering comedian Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy) has an epiphany that turns him into a word-of-mouth sensation: step onstage as someone else. Borrowing from the street mythology of 1970s Los Angeles, Moore assumes the persona of Dolemite, a pimp with a cane and an arsenal of obscene fables. However, his ambitions exceed selling bootleg records deemed too racy for mainstream radio stations to play. Moore convinces a social justice-minded dramatist (Keegan-Michael Key) to write his alter ego a film, incorporating kung fu, car chases, and Lady Reed (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), an ex-backup singer who becomes his unexpected comedic foil. Despite clashing with his pretentious director, D’Urville Martin (Wesley Snipes), and countless production hurdles at their studio in the dilapidated Dunbar Hotel, Moore’s Dolemite becomes a runaway box office smash and a defining movie of the Blaxploitation era.

*Each ticket purchase includes Brantley's newest album, Fire &amp; Brimstone. Brantley Gilbert lives in Jefferson, Georgia rather than, like so many country stars, Nashville. It’s not that he’s not serious about his music, or his career, but somethings run deeper. Or, as he sings in “Grown Ass Man” from his platinum Just As I Am, “I got a home.” That home is rich with life, truth, friends, history – and those are the raw materials that have made Gilbert one of only four country artists with back-to-back platinum certified albums. For Gilbert, who won the 2014 American Music Award for Favorite Country Album for Just As I Am, every album is another chapter in the life the unrepentant good ole boy has led. Whether it’s raising hell, standing tall or bottoming out, Gilbert’s truth speaks to the heart of blue collar life in the 21st century: hard working, fun loving and deeply committed to the people he loves.* 8pm, $73.50-$108.50.

I've tried MeetUp and it seems like every other group is a senior singles group. I commute to class at UHart since it's only on Saturdays, and the class sizes so far have ranged from four to six, myself included. The campus is also an hour away from me, so I'd like to save on gas by not going up there all the time; I don't know if it'd be worth going up just to attend a potential club meeting.   

I thought I had made friends when I was at UConn as a biology undergrad student, but it seems like I mistook their friendliness as actual friendship. After graduating, when everyone went their own ways, trying to reach out to these people felt like pulling teeth. Texting, FB Messenger, email - it felt nearly impossible to get a response out of them, let alone coordinate meeting them in say, NYC or Boston where some of them were. I get that they're likely busy and making new friends that they see more often, but when one of them told me I'm their homie, I believed that. Sometimes I've been so depressed that I wished some of these acquaintances were dead, if only for them to have an excuse as to why they suddenly vanished from my life almost entirely, in spite of all the technology we have these days to communicate. 

The funny thing that I believe about CT, is that it's a great place to grow up, but a terrible place to *be* grown up. I've been attending DnD in Middletown, so that's nice, I guess. I've never even had a gf. But I think that's because I've often struggled with taking initiative for things in general; I don't think it's because of my looks or personality. 

I mean, money isn't a notable issue for me right now, but I hear my money will go further if I live in Pittsburgh, too. I even hear it's the best place in the nation right now to be a first-time homeowner. Between the multiple times I've visited there, it feels like Pittsburgh has so many more activities, clubs, groups, events, and it just feels like there are more people that are around my age there. 

It's lovely being near the sea, and also near NYC and Boston (Metro North from Union Station, anyone?), but I feel like the value of these things begins to fade when it feels really hard to find someone to share them with.",Connecticut,Feeling lonely.

754,whyRUsoconvinced,1580366638,ew1982,Nan," So I was in a Geissler's grocery store in Connecticut with friends last summer picking up charcoal fluid or something. It was SO beautiful outside. Anyway, we were wearing “perfectly normal hippie clothes”. I swear to god. Just vests, jeans, sandals. That's it.  I counted like 5 American flag, punisher skull hoodies. Everyone in the place actually stared us down. Like, 8 different people “visibly recoiled” at seeing us and stared us down while shaking their heads and making :/ faces. Also, people in the same check out line right next to us. The parking lot was full of red pickups and the roads are all cracking the fuck apart.   

  
  So, I had to stop at a totally different Geissler's on the way to my cousin's house this week, and there's a fat banner for the nazi-president on the front of the store. I'm like, eh, I'm just wearing a purple hoodie. They'll probably be fine with that. I only got maybe two weird looks, but no head shakes or anything. But then as I'm checking out, some brosef with the gel-pouf/buzzcut refers to me as “the hipstery-ass dude in front of us” in this totally apathetic tone.  I'm just buying some potatoes wearing my purple hoodie, black jeans and doc's and my beard is like medium length. He's wearing a Harley hoodie with a checkerboard beanie and talking to his girlfriend. I'm not even mad about any of this, it's just so sad and baffling as to how Connecticut has turned from what it was in the 90s, into this. 1. Should this bum me out? 2. What the fuck? 3. Why is Connecticut so apathetic and what the fuck has happened to it? So many people I know there are the most eye rolling, apathetic, insufferable snobs about anything bright or colorful or different!

Besides MonsterJam, are there any good car or tractor shows in CT that would be worth going to? It doesn't need to be interactive, but just something we can go to in hopes of seeing lots of cars. (For reference, I took him to the playground a few days ago and he spent the entire time touching, running around, and looking at a Kubota nearby).

I'm in Western CT but am fine driving. And last addition, we have already done a ton of ""touch a truck"" firetruck events in our town.

839,tway15q1,1580701570,ey0uda,Nan,"I was in a major chain grocery store in Connecticut a couple days ago. (Never mind which and where; that's not relevant.) All the carry-style baskets were gone. They told me that they'd been stolen. (All but ""one or two"".) Stolen by people who used them to carry groceries to their cars, and then drove home with them. Apparently because they were angry about the new bag law, and childishly decided it must the store's fault, and so the store should be punished.

Never mind how stupid this is. Who doesn't know that it's the State imposing this, not the stores? But even if it was, what kind of immature jerk does this as petty revenge? Never mind the numbers that must have been involved in stealing nearly every single one of those baskets? (Dozens, if not scores.)

Does anyone here have experience living in both states? I do like the idea of 4 seasons and being closer to the water. Houston is okay, not pretty but has the convenience of city living.

841,morrowindscrib,1580717657,ey3we9,Nan,"I'm 25 and grew up in Norwich. It's a literal desert for anything related to shopping or restaurants. If you want to eat at a decent chain restaurant youre most likely going to be driving to New London/Groton/Waterford. The closest super Walmart is located 5 miles away in Lisbon. Dick's SG and Home Depot are in Lisbon and Montville. Wanna see a movie? Lisbon. 

 The most Norwich sees for development is a new Pharmacy or crappy restaurant every 5 years. It's just boring. In the early 2000s we had a 2 screen movie theater and a modest indoor mall. All gone now. The closest mall is the Crystal Mall in Waterford. To take your driving test you have to go to Willimantic, which is a smaller city than Norwich. 

Norwich has Mohegan Park which is pretty, but there's nothing else nearby. Norwich isn't particularly dangerous, but it's mostly rundown and there are a few sketchy parts. The downtown is mostly a joke with a bar and a couple of stores.


I've always kind-of thought of Waterbury as like a bigger Norwich, being a bigger small city removed from most urban parts of the state. I've learned that Waterbury is substantially more racially diverse than Norwich which is a plus. I also saw the very high poverty rate and that there's been about 8-10 murders a year. Norwich is much less impacted by murders, averaging only 0-1 per year. 

I've also read about Waterbury being statistically one of the worst cities in the US, but I wonder if this is exaggerated. How are the schools, generally? Do people seem to get along with eachother for the most part. Eastern CT is very boring and I feel like if I'm going to stay here forever and start a family, id want to do that in Southwestern CT. 

So I just wanted to tell you about Norwich, and hear some similarities between here and Waterbury and hopefully some positive differences as well.",Connecticut,Waterbury Vs Norwich

We’re from Iowa originally, and currently live in Idaho, which we ended up liking waaayyyyyy more than we thought we would. The outdoors opportunities here are practically endless. We really like having easy access to forests/reserves/wilderness areas in all seasons (never thought I’d own a pair of snowshoes in my life but here we are). We both enjoy fishing and bidding and generally being outside. I have gotten *very spoiled* by our proximity to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. We enjoy local breweries and weird little festivals and shit like that. Neither of us want to deal with an interstate system that makes us absolutely miserable, nor do we want ridiculous commutes. We’re both extroverts and have no time or patience for clique-y bullshit. 

We’re also both Democrats, very active, but do fine living in an area where we’re made to feel like the minority. I’m actually very involved in state party politics and enjoy the number of opportunities I’ve had offered to me through that, something I’m not sure I’d have in CT since it’s pretty reliably blue. I very much intend to get involved wherever we land and I want my perspective and skills to be taken seriously — again, something that’s probably more likely in OH, but I don’t know what the state government is like in CT. 

Cost of living is an issue and Columbus isn’t too far off what we have here, but that could be moot depending on what kind of offer my spouse gets. 

I am also definitely a city person and my spouse is not.

Cities
* Southington. We heard there's a lot to do here and it's easy to meet people, but has a low population (&lt;50k) which makes us skeptical
* Watertown. A cozy seeming place that probably has a tight knit community. Seems to have a lot of nice restuarants. Doesn't seem to have much to do however. 
* Milford. Seems like a nice place to live, while also being near active cities like New Haven and Norwalk. Also close to a train that can take you to NYC. We're worried the commute to Waterbury will be horrendous though. Google Maps shows 35min, but we suspect it'll be worse. 
* Middletown: Seems to have a lot to do, and has a lot of interesting bars and restuarants. Low population, again, makes us skeptical. We're also worried about the commute.

Some info that could help
* Age: Both in our late 20s
* I'm an engineer and my gf is a pharmacist
* Budget: up to 3k. Being from Boston, you get used to outrageous rent prices
* Commute: No more than 30min from Waterbury 
* Looking for: A place that's easy to make friends in, also offers a lot to do, and has low crime. Gf and I are both foodies, enjoy nerdy hobbies and learning, participating in community events, and enjoy the occasional night life. An active night life is not important as long as it's easy to meet people our age via other events.
* Bonuses: Diverse population and being near community colleges

The eagle was taken from its locked aviary at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Ashford, state police said in a press release Monday.

“It is just a feeling of dread and panic,” said Mary-Beth Kaeser, owner and founder of Horizon Wings Rehabilitation and Education Center.

Kaeser went to feed Atka, the bald eagle, but instead found the door to his aviary open and the lock on the ground.

Atka came to Horizon Wings as a 1-year-old nine years ago. He has a permanent wing injury, but Kaeser’s team trained him to be an educational ambassador. According to Kaeser, he attends more than 100 programs per year, working mostly with children. 

“People are pretty much in awe of him,” said Kaeser. “He is magnificent.” 

Atka was at a program just yesterday. He returned home and Kaeser locked him in his aviary. The next morning, he was nowhere to be found. The staff at Horizon Wings is worried about where he could be and who has him. 

“There is a black market for them and there is a black market for their feathers,” said Kaeser. “Some people don’t care how they get their money and that is my biggest fear.”

State police were contacted this morning to take over the investigation from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. 

In the meantime, Kaeser said that the staff is holding out hope that maybe someone did not take Atka, but just opened the door and let him walk off. As a flightless bird, Kaeser said he would not have been able to go far. 

“We have been looking under all of the aviaries, wood piles,” said Ann Pacheco, who helped search for Atka Monday. “It is a bird for some people, but if you had a relationship with this bird it becomes your family.”

Horizon Wings is offering a reward to anyone who can bring Atka back. As of Monday night, the reward had reached $4,000. 

“I just want him back,” said Kaeser. “I just want him back and I want him safe. That’s all I want.”

According to State Police, anyone who sees the eagle should not approach it.  

If you have any information, call Horizon Wings at 860-481-0525 or Connecticut State Police at 860-896-3200.

Recently came through to help launch a building within the company in July.  It's time for me to leave again and help open another. This means I am breaking my lease of a $950 monthly rent that was suppose to last til 8/1/2020. My last day of residency is 2/29/2020.  


The lease has a default clause in which states ""In the event Landlord is unable to re-let the PREMISES during any remaining term of this Lease, after default of the Tenant, Landlord may at its option hold Tenant liable for balance of the unpaid rent under this Lease if this Lease continued by force.""  


Clearly after they exercised: conn. gen. stat. ann. § 47a-11a  
...Right?  


I'm just trying make sure I won't have a small claims court case waiting for me right away.  
I did my due diligence by letting them know I have a traveling job, paying rent a week ahead before due and gave them a 30 day notice of my Job Location Renewal. All I was responded with "" You have a contract to adhere by. I advise you go over your lease.""   
I am sending my certified letter out tomorrow considering the response and have a verbal conversation Saturday when I come back from the business trip.

Can anyone recommend a town or city to stay for the week? Anywhere within an hour in any direction from Cheshire that the kids would enjoy as well. Somewhere along the coast would be best but if anyone has any other ideas I am open to hear them. Thanks for the help.,Connecticut,Recommendations for an out of state visitor?

1061,TheK0ntrarian,1581638399,f3jfed,Nan,"Thank you for your message regarding Iran. I appreciate hearing from you.

     As you may know, after several days of protests that culminated in the storming of the United States Embassy in Baghdad, the Trump administration ordered a military strike that killed Major General Qassim Soleimani in Iraq. In response, Iran launched missiles at Iraqi military bases hosting American troops. Although General Soleimani was responsible for the loss of thousands of American servicemembers, I have serious concerns with the administration’s inability to provide compelling justification to explain to the American people how this strike serves our long-term strategic objectives and national security. This decision heightened the risk of escalated conflict with Iran and put our security and allies at risk.

     For too long, the Trump administration has kept the American people in the dark, and instead portrayed a confusing and chaotic picture of the threat posed by Iran. The president’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, as well as his inflammatory comments and military posturing, are reckless and provocative actions that risk military conflict. The United States must work with our global allies to pursue a de-escalation of tensions in order to reduce the potential for a miscalculation that would lead to war. Rest assured, I will continue to demand transparency and accountability from the administration and will work to prevent escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.

     As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I firmly believe Congress must exercise its constitutional responsibility to authorize war. The present authorizations for the use of military force in no way cover starting a war with Iran. For these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor S.J.Res.68, a bipartisan bill that would direct the removal of United States armed forces from hostilities against Iran that have not been authorized by Congress. Additionally, in January 2020, I joined a number of my colleagues in introducing the No War With Iran Act, which is a strict funding prohibition on offensive military operations against Iran, until and unless Congress declares war or enacts a specific statutory authorization for the use of military force. The Constitution gives Congress the right and responsibility to both authorize and fund military operations. At a time when the administration continuously seeks to undermine our country’s system of checks and balances, congressional approval of the use of military force is essential in order to certify the appropriate use of U.S. forces.

     Thank you again for your message. Please feel free to reach out with any future questions or concerns.",Connecticut,A response from Blumenthal about the Iran situation

1070,Shea_zzzz,1581689529,f3spqz,Nan,"Since moving to Connecticut in 2018 I have had some of the most draining experiences in my life. Not only are the people here extremely nosey, but the white population and police here are extremely racist, rude, and the fucking government is built on the poor.  I once worked in a company where I was the only person of color in an office that was located in FARMINGTON, CT. In such a ‘diverse’ State, how is that even possible? It was one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life, to the point where I got up and walked out of work one day. I had no job but I could not spend another day in that place. The thing is, they had hired people of color before but none stayed , I wonder why?

Secondly the FUCKING PARKING AUTHORITY. I have spent so much money on tickets it is insane. On my street I have a parking sign that requires me to move my car at 8am every Friday and Tuesday to the OPPOSITE side of the street. If I don’t, I get a ticket between $45 - $100 dollars. Today is my day off from working back to back shifts and I jumped out of bed 8:30 to greet a $50 ticket for not moving my car in time. ON MY DAY OFF FROM!  Now if I didn’t have to pay ROAD and CAR taxes, and had proper roads I wouldn’t be so annoyed. 

Let’s talk about the lack of resources. I recently got a Sphynx cat for a pet ( adorable guy!) but I have to get him neutered. Not surprising NONE of the low cost clinics have space for the next 3 months due to funding. Others had to cut their programs all together. Vets are charging me between $150-800 just to have my cat neutered! Who can afford that?! Not me! especially not with this low minimum wage and parking tickets! No proper planned parenthood for poor communities, the 84 highway has been under construction for 20 plus fucking years, and the roads are terrible.

This post was a rant but to be honest do not come here if you are reading this. For a state that is located between Boston and New York it is sad and disappointing. It allowed those cities to grow and develop without realizing the consequences. I’m on my way out in the next 2 years back to my original city. I have come to realize I would rather pay high taxes and have a high cost of living if I actually see the results in the infrastructure.

I have had the distinct displeasure of witnessing the knee jerk reaction of underinformed people making policy decisions that egregiously effect the wrong people. 

I am talking about the “opioid crisis”

Yes- I am all for those afflicted by addiction to be safe and have access to proper treatment.

However, I am not for the lack of post-surgical medical care or guidance that is being provided to those in need. 

Some background— A beloved companion over the last 3 months has had several procedures. The most recent being an inguinal hernia surgery (Robotic, 3 holes and some mesh in the lower abdomen). Prior to that, they had the distinct displeasure of having all their teeth removed for dentures.  (5 visits, Novocain-wide awake).  After every procedure he was given exactly 1-day worth of pain killers, low dose 5 mg oxycodone (Percocet).

For each and every single of the procedures my companion was made to feel like a drug addict for being in pain, if not from the pharmacy or insurance company then from the doctor.

Recommended course of action – Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Mind you both those drugs can cause liver failure if exceed daily dose (3000 mg Tylenol and 3200 mg Ibuprofen) that sounds like a lot- but it isn’t. Tylenol capsules are 500 mg apiece making the max daily dose 6 pills. Ibuprofen when prescribed is 800 mg max daily dose 4 pills. If you have ever had a severe headache you know that taking 2 Tylenol barley touches the pain.

Now imagine the pain of having a quarter of your teeth ripped from your head in a single visit -going back every third day to repeat the process.  Imagine having 3 holes cut into your body to pull your intestines back inside your body and patching up lower abdomen with mesh. (Estimated recovery time-10 days. After that can’t lift more than 10 lbs. for 6 weeks) Couple that with the humiliating experience of being in pain and practically begging for relief. Only to be made to feel like a junkie.

We have been made to feel powerless in our own care, dismissed and shooed away. 

To be fair- the medical community must follow the rules and regulations being passed down from the great state of Connecticut.  That doesn’t excuse their behavior though.

Never once was there information or education given for alternative pain management such as meditation, breathing, or types of movements.  Not once was their experience met with compassion or understanding.  Just the harsh - cold and negligent behavior of the medical community in Connecticut.

Why is it negligent? My companion who does not drink, is begging for whiskey. Which comes with a its own host of terrible side effects directly pertaining to surgery. Worse case scenario? They seek pain relief from more illicit means. Which seems to me, the opposite of the policies intentions.",Connecticut,Healthcare has become a joke!! *Rant* *first time posting*

1206,TheRealBaseborn,1582237928,f712lo,Nan,"Paper bags are not included in the tax. These stores have always had paper bags and they were always free. ""Paper or plastic?"" they'd ask.

Am I missing something here? Why did people applaud this response? *This baffles me.* Are people really this obsessed with ""sticking it to the man"" that they'd completely overlook the fact that they're still getting the raw deal here? The cost to make paper bags is more, yes, by about 3 cents per bag, but when properly packed a single paper bag can fit the same amount as 2-3 plastic bags. Alternatively, these stores could charge 5 cents to simply recoup their cost for the increased usage of paper bags. Instead they've chosen to mark the price up a full 100% and profit off the customer. At the end of the day, no matter how you slice it, the cost has gone up for the consumer.

Is anyone else annoyed by this?

1209,tway15q1,1582267708,f77c55,Nan,"I learned today that some people in Connecticut are feeding bears. This is dangerous for them, for others, and for the bears.

BEARS ARE SMART AND CAN LEARN HOW TO LIVE IN HUMAN HABITATS -- FOR AWHILE

Bears that learn to associate food with humans will increasingly seek out places where humans are, in the hopes of obtaining food. That can mean rummaging through garbage, going through your shed, going under your deck or porch, trying to get into your car, garage, basement, porch, home, or business, overturning cans at the edge of your yard or in the street, going through dumpsters, approaching or following people with trash cans or bags, approaching or following people with any kind of bag or anything that looks to them like a bag -- such as a baby, or school bag, or sports bag -- and reduce their instinctive fear of humans and human places.

A FED BEAR IS A DEAD BEAR

This poses an obvious danger to people, but also to the bears themselves. Bears are a lot like us in many ways. They are curious, they investigate things, they like to play with things they find in human habitats (until they break them), and they will seek easier ways to accomplish things -- especially getting food. Once they successfully get food from humans without being harmed, they will continue to do that until something bad happens. Then they will be shot and killed. But that will happen **after** the incident, which may result in substantial property damage, grievous harm, permanent injuries or maiming, or even someone's death. Killing the bear won't bring your dog or kid back to life. It only means that there were two preventable deaths.

SO: DON'T FEED BEARS -- EVER

If you see someone feeding a bear, or learn about someone feeding a bear, report them to the Animal Control office of the local police department, or to the State Police, or to DEEP. Feeding wild bears on private property is not illegal in Connecticut, though there are proposals to make it so. Until then, authorities can advise people who feed bears why they should not do it. They will also want to know so that they can have some idea of where to expect bears in the future: They are more likely to show up where they've successfully acquired food in the past.

If you see a bear, it may only be passing through. But if you see a bear in the same area more than once, other than in the wild, then you should report it, as it may be a bear that is a little too used to being around human places. Sometimes, DEEP can successfully remove them to the wild, before they get too used to being around people.",Connecticut,Do not feed bears! Ever!!

But TL;DR - looking for things I may not have considered about moving from NYC to Fairfield county after having grown up in CT but not having spent time there in about 8yrs.

- I grew up in Westport, but I’ve lived in NYC for going on 11 years (but my subway commute generally averages 45minutes to union square or below, any higher up or west can easily be an hour).  Parents moved to Manhattan about 8yrs ago so I haven’t spent any time in CT since they left.  My fiancée is in union construction in Manhattan, I am a creative freelancer.  He is 36, I’m 32.

- Main reasons for moving to CT are better quality of life and having our own home (he recently bought his mother a home in FL).  We love NYC but we currently live deep in Queens and have a significant subway commute as it is.  We don’t drink or party so the need for nightlife evades us completely.  We feel that we aren’t even taking advantage of living in NYC at this point because we are so run down and fed up with it here.  We want some nature, space, privacy, a fireplace, dogs, an actual HOME, etc which we consider total luxuries at this point.  I also have very fond memories of Fairfield County, how beautiful it is, and somehow always saw myself ending up back outside the city.

- We don’t want to have kids so school district doesn’t matter, making Norwalk an attractive option.  I have seen amazing things in the $400-$500k range (our budget.). I’ve also seen some great things in Fairfield which surprised me.  The commute from Norwalk seems manageable too, all my metro north experience is coming from the Westport stations. 

- He would be commuting to get to work at 7am, and leaving work at 3pm so his commute may be early enough to avoid completely packed trains (???).  I freelance so my job location and hours can change week to week, but sometimes I would be commuting every day to get to work at 9am, not every week though.  So my schedule might yield more commute issues.  We are fine with having 2 cheaper crappier cars because he can work on them himself, and will factor the metro north costs into our budget when buying.   We know we would need subway passes AND metro north AND a car.

- our combined income can be $175-$200kish a year.  Tax wise, is this a good idea to move to CT and work in NYC?  I feel like even though we will have added costs moving / buying a home / commuting, we can still have a comfortable life on this budget outside the city.

We are ready to make a big change and enter a new era in our lives even though the commute will be greater.  But is it hard to get a parking pass these days for the Norwalk or Fairfield train stations and if so, how do you end up parking for the commute?  Will the commute destroy the higher quality of life we are looking to gain?  We don’t have friends up there obviously but we are in AA and would plan to meet people that way.  Is it crazy to move to the suburbs when we don’t even want to have kids?  

I know that some of this is personal anxieties that would arise from any move, but I appreciate anything you guys may have to offer.  Again, sorry this is a long post and I won’t be surprised if no one responds but if you do, thanks so much for your time!",Connecticut,"Planning to move to Norwalk/Fairfield in a year from NYC, need some input"

Usually the stray cats run away from me when they see me (there's actually quite a bit of stray cats near me), but this poor thing nuzzles up against my leg, sniffs all around me and makes soft meow sounds...its really friendly.

We come back from shopping and the cat is still outside my front door, resting in a small corner nook.  Me and my gf decide to leave some food and water for the cat, but we don't know what else we can do for it.  

I looked up online if vets can help stray animals and some articles say they can, so I decide to call the closest 24 hour vet (the one in North Haven) to see what our options were.

Some were so insanely greasy I had to wait until I got home to soak it up. At this point I get it, their pizza is deeply rooted in tradition and they'll never change it. But the hype I heard for years is so overblown. I'd rather have Domino's than any 3 of these. Factor in the long lines and huge crowds, it's just not worth the effort for these places. I've had so much pizza around the state, many other ""new Haven style apizza"" as well. I like to think I know my pizzas whether it's Greek, Italian, New York, new haven, wood fired, or Sicilian or from a major chain.

BAR pizza is far superior to the big 3 and IMO better represents what you'll fine around CT as ""new Haven apizza"". Outside of Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern, I've never had ""new haven"" pizza similar to them. It's all been much more similar to Bar.

Vogue cheers, “It’s a must-see you’ll remember for years to come!” Originally directed by visionary Tony®-winner Diane Paulus and based on the critically-acclaimed Academy Award® winning film, Finding Neverland tells the incredible story behind one of the world’s most beloved characters: Peter Pan. Playwright J.M. Barrie struggles to find inspiration until he meets four young brothers and their beautiful widowed mother. Spellbound by the boys’ enchanting make-believe adventures, he sets out to write a play that will astound London theatergoers. With a little bit of pixie dust and a lot of faith, Barrie takes this monumental leap, leaving his old world behind for Neverland, where nothing is impossible and the wonder of childhood lasts forever. The magic of Barrie’s classic tale springs spectacularly to life in this heartwarming theatrical event. Finding Neverland is “far and away the best musical of the year!” (NPR).* Thu.7:30 p.m., Fri. 8 p.m., Sat. 2 p.m. &amp; 8 p.m., Sun. 1 p.m. &amp; 5 p.m. ADMISSION: $55-$85.

*The Revivalists are bringing their Into The Stars Tour to Foxwoods Resort Casino. Some people say 'luck is the intersection of hard work and opportunity.' On their fourth full-length album and first for Loma Vista Recordings, The Revivalists chronicle, catalog, and capture an unbelievable ride where ten years of tireless hard work would be unexpectedly revved up by the wrongly dubbed “overnight success” of the gold-selling number one single “Wish I Knew You.” Like any enduring band worth its salt, they reacted the best way possible to newfound popularity, by buckling down and turning up with an album chock full of tunes worthy of even greater success. It’s the result of a trip that unassumingly commenced in 2008 with hundreds of underground shows yearly and culminated 10 years later with not only “Wish I Knew You,” but three years of back-to-back sold out headline tours. In life, like rock ‘n’ roll, some questions get answered while others stay unanswered. Our personal backroads tuck, twist, and turn through ups, downs, and everything in between at light speed, sometimes without explanation or a moment for reflection. Mirroring the push-and-pull of the past few years, the boys—David Shaw \[lead vocals, guitar\], Zack Feinberg \[guitar\], Andrew Campanelli \[drums\], George Gekas \[bass\], Ed Williams \[pedal steel guitar\], Rob Ingraham \[saxophone\], Michael Girardot \[keyboard, trumpet\], and PJ Howard \[drums, percussion\]—deliver a bevy of anthems marked by moments of sonic complexity, celebration, and catharsis.* 8 p.m. $36-$56., Grand Theater at Foxwoods Resort Casino, 350 Trolley Line Blvd. Mashantucket, CT
* [**Bert Kreischer: The Berty Boy World Tour, February** 28](https://www.foxwoods.com/bert-kreischer/)  
*Comedian Bert Kreischer is bringing his Berty Boy World Tour, but probably not his shirt, to Foxwoods Resort Casino. Bert Kreischer is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer and host who performs to sellout crowds across the country. His standup specials “Secret Time” and The Machine are currently streaming globally on Netflix. Described as having a “rare and incredible talent” (Interrobang), Bert has evolved from being named Rolling Stone’s1997 ""Number One Partier in the Nation"" to one of the top names in comedy. Between his two previous stand-up specials, The Machine on Showtime (2016) and Comfortably Dumb on Comedy Central (2009), his two podcasts: “Bertcast,” and “Open Tabs,” his YouTube cooking show: “Something’s Burning,” his book Life of the Party: Stories of a Perpetual Man-Child (2014), Bert has succeeded in finding the elusive blend of “being a cringe comedian with real insight” (Interrobang). Lauded as one of the best storytellers of his generation, Bert seamlessly and sincerely shares anecdotes about his family and fatherhood while showing his ability to prove “that there’s a way to take his \[party-boy\] antics into middle-age,” (Forbes). His infamous story about robbing a train with the Russian Mafia was recently optioned by Legendary (the studio behind The Hangover Series, Jurassic World, and Straight Outta Compton) to be turned into a movie. After the successful debut of The Body Shots World Tour"" in 2019, where he quickly sold out theaters and added shows in almost every market, Bert is launching a brand new tour in 2020, ""The Berty Boy Tour,"" where he will do shows in even larger venues across the country. Tickets can be found at* [*BertBertBert.com*](https://BertBertBert.com)*. 8 p.m. &amp; 11 p.m. $40-$60.* Grand Theater at Foxwoods Resort Casino, 350 Trolley Line Blvd. Mashantucket, CT

* [**""Agrippina"", February 29**](https://ridgefieldplayhouse.org/event/agrippina-handel/)  
*In the Met’s first-ever performances of Agrippina, Handel’s satire of sex and power politics, Sir David McVicar reconceives a production he originally created for the Monnaie in Brussels in 2000, evoking a scandalous world in which the Roman Empire never fell but simply kept going right up to the present. Holding a distorted mirror to contemporary society (as Handel did when he staged this opera), the production presents the corrupt intrigues of the political classes, brought to life by Joyce DiDonato as the power-hungry empress Agrippina, Brenda Rae as the scheming, seductive Poppea, and Kate Lindsey as the feckless teenager Nerone. Iestyn Davies portrays the ambitious officer Ottone, and Matthew Rose is the emperor Claudius, on whose vacated throne Agrippina is determined to install her son. Renowned for his interpretations of the Baroque repertoire, Harry Bicket conducts. 12:55 p.m. $15-$25.* Ridgefield Playhouse, 80 East Ridge Rd. Ridgefield, CT

Anyways, I love the Jeep and I would love to fix it. Body what you can see without getting on your knees looks good but floor is in need of some heavy work.

Coronavirus bio: 

- 5% of people require [artificial respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_ventilation), an additional 15% need [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy). Overall, about 80% of cases are mild, and 20% severe. Overall, there has been a case fatality rate of around ~3.6%. 

- Infection lasts 2 to 4 weeks for mild cases, 3 to 6 weeks in severe cases. Reinfection is possible and has been confirmed in multiple cases. 

- People can spread the disease before they show any symptoms, ie you can infect other people before you know you are sick. 

- Infection is primarily spread through aerosolized respiratory droplets. Fecal transmission is highly likely as well and possibly more infectious. 

- In China, we saw the local healthcare system in Hubei completely overwhelmed. This is a bad thing, as the healthcare systems being overwhelmed might possibly mean a higher death rate (20% of patients need intensive treatment afterall). In China, mass quarantines and lockdowns have been used to contain the disease. Currently, the CCP is reporting falling infection numbers in their country, although these numbers are suspect for obvious reasons. 

- The virus can be spread by a person before they exhibit any symptons, ie a person can spread it before they know they are sick. 

- The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

- Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (untreated diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

- [Fatality rate by age](https://files.catbox.moe/l5q4fy.png)

- Sex: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

- There is [some unsubstantiated speculation that the disease may cause infertility in men](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022418v1.full.pdf). There has also been unsubstantiated speculation that the disease may be deadlier in people of asian descent due to the aforementioned ACE2 receptor. 

- As you probably already know, there have already been confirmed communal transmissions of coronavirus on the west coast (not able to be traced to China) 

**What you can do to prepare**: The less you have to go out, the less your chances of contracting this disease. If you are a healthy young person, you may feel safe, but please remember you probably also have contact with some elderly people, like your parents or grandparents. Even if you don't, you getting infected. So my advice to you is: 

- **MAKE SURE your elderly relatives are taken care of and know what to do and what to avoid doing.** This is by far the most important thing imo. They are the most at risk rn. 

- Avoid restaurant eating and going out for nonessential reasons. 

- Stockpile some non perishable food, just in case we get quarantines/lockdowns as has happened in Italy and China. I've gotten a bunch of canned food and some butter and things to freeze. 

- Make sure you have first aid and medicine supplies. If you get sick with something other than coronavirus during this pandemic, the absolute last place you will want to go is to the healthcare system, since it will be completely overwhelmed and you will most likely contract the virus there. 

- Just to be safe, I have gotten p100's, but the CDC says m95's will be effective. Surgical masks do probably have reduced effectiveness, but I'd always take them over nothing. Airtight goggles might also help. Also remember to get things like toothpaste, **soap,** toilet paper, ammunition, and other such things.

Visitors will see spectacular examples of Maya artistry made by masters of their craft, along with objects from everyday life.

I can't find too many articles online about it online since it's not as populated an area as say, NYC or New Jersey or Long Island. My story features wealthy privileged characters who live in Fairfield County, in particular Greenwich and New Canaan. I have a scene with them shopping on Greenwich Ave, what was it like during 1980s? Was it the same luxurious market that it seems to be now (based from what I've read)? What kind of stores were/are there?

The reason why I am asking this is because 1) I do not, nor have ever lived in Connecticut (I'm from Long Island), 2) I was born in 1994 and 3) I want to hear from somebody who lived there at the time (or at the least, is familiar with the area) cause I want accuracy.

What about having your name called so softly you can’t hear when your order is ready, forcing you to wait 20 minutes longer than you need to, and then be blamed for not hearing when your order is done? Yes? Then boy do I have a store for you! Ladies and gentlemen, Let me introduce you to the worst pharmacy I have ever used! CVS at 2045 Dixwell in Hamden! I have never had a good experience there! I invite you never have a good experience too! This place is so bad,  I’d think twice about going there even if they told me I could have my meds for free! 

Tonight was extra special, after receiving a text that my meds would be ready on Friday, I went in on Friday and they weren’t ready. When I dared ask why I would receive such a text, I got the loquacious and useful response “that’s corporate” and nothing else. I actually had to ask if if the conversation was over. What the hell does “that’s corporate” even mean? How can a text (noun) be corporate (adjective)? I assume she meant that the problem originated as a result of CVS corporate operations. If this is true, what about responding with an empathic, “I’m sorry. I know this sucks. I  ant do anything about your problem and I wish I could. This upsets me too. I have to deal with this garbage all the time.” ? I would have loved that. I would have left without my meds but happy nonetheless. Instead I just left.

So I am on the market for a new cell phone carrier. I have been using Sprint for the past year as they had a free unlimited everything for a year plan- but I have no interest in sticking with them now that the year is up. Their coiverage was pretty mediocre. However, I spend the vast majority of my time in urban central CT (Hartford, Newington, New Britain area) so it is rare that I hit actual dead zones. 

With that said, I was wondering if anyone here has tried ""Visible"", they are apparently offering $25 a month unlimited everything plan and off of Verizon's network. They don't have roaming options unfortunately, but its a pretty interesting price regardless. I am also considering Cricket Wireless (AT&amp;T MVNO) which I could get for a similar price. 

Is there anyone here with experience with either/both of those networks who could vouch, or maybe has some other suggestion for something cheaper/better?

Thank you.",Connecticut,Experience with Visible/Cricket wireless? (Looking for the cheapest unlimited data plan in CT)

1746,JoyfulCTguy,1583947083,fh0ono,Nan,"There’s an old brain teaser that goes like this: You have a pond of a certain size, and upon that pond, a single lilypad. This particular species of lily pad reproduces once a day, so that on day two, you have two lily pads. On day three, you have four, and so on.

Now the teaser. “If it takes the lily pads 48 days to cover the pond completely, how long will it take for the pond to be covered halfway?”

The answer is 47 days. Moreover, at day 40, you’ll barely know the lily pads are there.

That grim math explains why so many people — including me — are worried about the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease known as covid-19. And why so many other people think we are panicking over nothing.

During the current flu season, they point out, more than 250,000 people have been hospitalized in the United States, and 14,000 have died, including more than 100 children. As of this writing, the coronavirus has killed 29 people, and our caseload is in the hundreds. Why are we freaking out about the tiny threat while ignoring the big one?

Quite a number of people have suggested that it’s because the media just wants President Trump to look bad. Trump seems particularly fond of this suggestion.

But go back to those lily pads: When something dangerous is growing exponentially, everything looks fine until it doesn’t. In the early days of the Wuhan epidemic, when no one was taking precautions, the number of cases appears to have doubled every four to five days.

The crisis in northern Italy is what happens when a fast doubling rate meets a “threshold effect,” where the character of an event can massively change once its size hits a certain threshold.

In this case, the threshold is things such as ICU beds. If the epidemic is small enough, doctors can provide respiratory support to the significant fraction of patients who develop complications, and relatively few will die. But once the number of critical patients exceeds the number of ventilators and ICU beds and other critical-care facilities, mortality rates spike.

Daniele Macchini, a doctor in Bergamo, Italy, recently posted a heart-stopping account to Facebook of what he and his colleagues have endured: the hospital emptying out, the wards eerily silent as they waited for the patients they couldn’t quite believe would come … and then, the “tsunami.”

“One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace. … The boards with the names of the patients, of different colors depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.”

A British health-care worker shared a message from a doctor in Italy, who alleged that covid-19 patients in their hospital who are over 65, or have complicating conditions, aren’t even being considered for the most intensive forms of supportive treatment.

The experts are telling us that here in the United States, we can avoid hitting that threshold where sizable regions of the country will suddenly step into hell. We still have time to #flattenthecurve, as a popular infographic put it, slowing the spread so that the number of cases never exceeds what our health system can handle. The United States has an unusually high number of ICU beds, which gives us a head start. But we mustn’t squander that advantage through complacency.

So everyone needs to understand a few things.

First, the virus is here, and it is spreading quickly, even though everything looks normal. Right now, the United States has more reported cases than Italy had in late February. What matters isn’t what you can see but what you can’t: the patients who will need ICU care in two to six weeks.

Second, this is not “a bad flu.” It kills more of its hosts, and it will spread farther unless we take aggressive steps to slow it down, because no one is yet immune to this disease. It will be quite some time before the virus runs out of new patients.

Third, we can fight it. Despite early exposure, Singapore and Hong Kong have kept their caseloads low, not by completely shutting down large swaths of their economies as China did but through aggressive personal hygiene and “social distancing.” South Korea seems to be getting its initial outbreak under control using similar measures. If we do the same, we can not only keep our hospitals from overloading but also buy researchers time to develop vaccines and therapies.

Fourth, and most important: We are all in this together. It is your responsibility to keep America safe by following the CDC guidelines, just as much as it is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s or President Trump’s responsibility to lead us to safety. And until this virus is beaten, we all need to act like it.",Connecticut,Coronavirus now officially a pandemic. Spread in Connecticut.

1748,allonsyyy,1583952738,fh26rp,Nan,"I know a lot of people have opinions on insecticides and whatnot, and the debate usually has a lot of heat and very little light surrounding it so let's try to keep this cool and bright.

[Chlorpyrifos Fact Sheet](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/04/the-facts-on-chlorpyrifos/)

excerpt 1:
&gt;Some studies do suggest that chlorpyrifos exposure can lead to developmental issues in children, for example, but they’re correlational studies, meaning they don’t provide causal links. However, research in rodents has found causal links between chlorpyrifos and developmental issues.

&gt;Other studies in human populations have failed to find correlations between chlorpyrifos and development issues in children, but that research may be suffering from what scientists call “confounding variables,” or unrelated factors that may be affecting the study’s results.

&gt;In other words, some research does suggest chlorpyrifos poses a threat to human health, but the question is whether or not it’s enough to warrant a complete ban of the insecticide.

excerpt 2:
&gt;Chlorpyrifos is called a “broad-spectrum” insecticide because it can kill a wide variety of insects. But its potential impact goes beyond insects.

&gt;The insecticide is “toxic” to birds and “extremely toxic” to fish, according to the National Institutes of Health. It’s also “extremely toxic” to non-target insects such as bees.


pdf [According to CT DEEP’s data, farms only account for 10.8% of chlorpyrifos used. Golf courses account for 86% of chlorpyrifos use in CT.](https://a405abfc-cc29-4d83-80dc-8317bff89633.filesusr.com/ugd/7bd21d_a570ef1b1cac47e9a11595bac9e379d3.pdf)

In my opinion, it is unethical to add to the ongoing [insect apocalypse](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/insect-apocalypse-under-way-toxic-pesticides-agriculture/) for stinkin' *golf courses*. Chlorpyrifos is already banned for residential use, and I'd be open to a compromise where it could still be used for agriculture but golf courses are a luxury. You can argue that people need food. You can't argue they need to golf, and they have to create an insect dead zone to do so.

Other people might be more concerned about the human effects, being human and all. But the effects on insects and wildlife are undeniable and the science is not in dispute, unlike the human effect studies.

&gt;[Ecotoxicity Studies:](http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/chlorptech.html)

&gt;Birds

&gt;Chlorpyrifos is very highly toxic to common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) with an LD50 of 5.62 mg/kg and 8.41 mg/kg, respectively. Chlorpyrifos is highly toxic to common pigeons (Columba livia) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with an LD50 of 10 mg/kg.4

&gt;Chlorpyrifos is highly toxic to chickens with an oral LD50 ranging from 32-102 mg/kg.2

&gt;Chlorpyrifos is moderately toxic to mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) with an acute oral LD50 of 490 mg/kg.2

&gt;The American robin (Turdus migratorius) is the most frequently reported avian species killed in field incidents with chlorpyrifos.4 Currently the acute LD50 for the American robin is unknown.

&gt;Fish and Aquatic Life

&gt;Chlorpyrifos is very highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, freshwater fish, and other estuarine and marine organisms.11
The 96-hour LC50 is 0.007-0.051 mg/L for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), 0.002-0.010 mg/L for bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), and 0.12-0.54 mg/L for fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas).2 The 48-hour LC50 for Daphnia is 1.7 μg/L. The LC50 for Korean shrimp (Palaemon macrodactylus) is 0.05 μg/L.2

&gt;There is potential for chlorpyrifos to bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic species.1 Residues of chlorpyrifos found in fish tissue included the metabolites TCP and two glucuronide conjugates of TCP.4 Researchers exposed various fish species to chlorpyrifos continuosly during early development, and calculated bioconcentration values ranging from 58 to 5100.63

&gt;Terrestrial Invertebrates

&gt;There are data gaps in terrestrial risk assessment due to a lack of quantitative methods available to assess risks posed by dermal and inhalation exposures for wildlife.4

&gt;Chlorpyrifos is highly toxic to bees. The honey bee (Apis sp.) oral LD50 is 360 ng/bee.2 Contact LD50s for honey bees of 59 and 70 ng/bee have been reported.2,4

&gt;The 14-day LC50 for worms (Eisenia foetida) is 210 mg/kg chlorpyrifos in soil.2

&gt;Foliar residues from spray applications of 0.5 and 1.0 lbs active ingredient/acre demonstrated toxicity to non-target insects for up to 24 hours post-treatment.4 See the NPIC fact sheet on Wildlife and Pesticides.

My mother-in-law, for example, just now realized how little food and dog food she has, and is worried about making sure she has enough in case of a quarantine.

If she were to go out today, among all the other panic buyers, there's a good chance there would be an infected person among them, who could pass it on to her.  She's in her '50s, and there's a good chance she might not survive if she gets sick.  That goes double for her mother whom she lives with, who is in her '80s.

1813,GiFieri,1584053991,fhpgl9,Nan,"Effective Monday March 16: 
 “Dear Parents and Families,

We are facing unprecedented challenges due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across our nation.  Circumstances are changing by the hour, though at this moment we have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Manchester. There is a need for all communities to take a proactive approach in slowing the spread of the virus.  

That being said, we have made the difficult decision to close all Manchester Public Schools indefinitely effective Monday, March 16, 2020. It is our hope that the closure will last two weeks but we will need to closely monitor conditions across the state and region before making a decision on a return date.

Tomorrow schools will remain open following an abbreviated schedule. That represents a change for Illing Middle School and Manchester High School who were scheduled for a full day.  Conferences at the elementary level and Bennet Academy are cancelled. We understand some parents may choose not to send their children to school tomorrow. If that is the case, please contact your child’s school and the absence will be excused. 

We will not have any formal distance-learning during this closure of school as such an approach would not allow for equitable experiences for all students. Students who are in school tomorrow will be given optional supplemental work to bring home with other optional work posted on school websites and shared through email, social media and more.

We are also in the process of developing a plan to make school meals available during the closure.  We will provide additional information as it becomes available.  

We know that this may create a hardship for many parents and guardians, but this decision is being made in the interest of the safety of students and staff. Health experts say it is crucial that steps be taken to contain a virus to minimize how quickly it may spread. We hope that this preventive measure will allow for a return to our usual schedule as soon as possible. 

In the meantime, we appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this stressful situation.


Sincerely

Matt Geary”",Connecticut,Manchester Public School Closure

I’ve narrowed it down based on suggestions and unit availability, as well as cost, and it looks like Norwich and New London are where I’m getting the most hits from. 

Can some natives compare and contrast these two places for me? I feel like new London is more metropolitan and would have more things to do, but I also see it’s only half the size of Norwich. I’d be happy anywhere with some good breweries and a little bit of nightlife, ie a bar that has a band one or two nights a week. I could honestly spend most of my time sitting on a porch. 

My girlfriend, however, would like somewhere more metropolitan, with parks and actual town events, she lives a more active lifestyle and is much more prone to cabin fever than I am.  She’d rather live somewhere like New haven (i mean honestly she’d rather live in NYC) but that’s not possible with my job. So I’m trying to find the location she’d enjoy the most.

I created a survey  that is inspired by Condé Nast Traveler's YouTube series of ""[50 People from 50 States](https://www.youtube.com/user/condenasttraveler/videos)"". They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

I am worried about how we are fixating on these numbers, they are **not** an accurate reflection of the pervasiveness of the virus in this state. 

There are only 2 testing kits in CT right now, meaning we can deliver roughly 1200 tests in **total**. I personally know at least 2 people who may have contracted the coronavirus right now, but are not going to get tested because of the hurdles they would have to jump through to get tested.

Even some of our own epidemiologists are saying that we [""shouldn't go to the hospitals, and more than 80 percent of people will get better on their own, at home ""](https://www.wfsb.com/news/residents-test-positive-for-coronavirus-in-ct/article_484bc35e-6396-11ea-95fd-1f160607f1f6.html) 

People hearing advice like this, in addition to the large numbers of people who don't face severe enough symptoms to warrant getting tested, means the real number of reported cases is **dramatically** under-representing the real number of infections, and not at all representative of reality. All its really reflective of is the **number of tests** we've done.

These counts are virtually worthless until there is dramatically increased testing.

My point is- I worry that people will see these relatively small numbers and get a false sense of security about the small # of cases currently recorded. You must assume everyone has it for now.",Connecticut,"Addressing meaningless Coronavirus ""Infection count"" in Connecticut"

&gt;Hello Senator Blumenthal,

&gt;I am a constituent of yours and am writing to express my utter shame and disgust that you are backing a law that will create massive security vulnerabilities in our communications by creating back doors in end to end encryption. Not only is this a misguided attempt to make technology safer, it actually CREATES vulnerabilities that can be exploited by criminals, bad actors, and hostile foreign governments, not to mention the massive breach of privacy that it would create for every American citizen.

&gt;What's worse is that you are pushing to get this bill passed in a time of crisis when the majority of the population is distracted with COVID19.

&gt;This is shameful and disgusting and cowardly and I assure you that if this bill passes not only will you not have my vote when it comes time to re-elect you, but I will do everything in my power to mobilize voters to get you out of office.

&gt;Do not pass this bill, for your own job's sake and for the security and privacy of everyone in America.

With what we know about how someone can have Coronavirus for 2 days - 2 weeks before showing symptoms and still be contagious. Massages and facials need to cease this is a huge industry that is going unchecked. The majority of my colleagues who are independent contractors or own businesses have closed their doors. Also most reputable massage therapy liability insurance companies have sent out notices recommending that massage practitioners should stand down for the next four weeks to stop the spread of the virus.  
So I’m looking to get in touch with someone in the state government who can inform this major franchised massage chain with multiple locations through the state to close their doors. These places are no different than gyms with the amount of people going in and out and not to mention the close contact in a small room and touching ( people aren’t even shaking hands right now!). 

Summary: most massage therapists have stopped practicing to stop the spread of the virus but one major chain seems to be waiting until the last minute to close, either they don’t care or they are woefully ignorant to how they could be contributing to spreading this virus.

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same.

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.).

If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see.

Curious on your thoughts on this.

Does it seem appropriate that a hospital employee (not nurse or doctor) who mainly works in an office and interacts with only their staff and out-patients can be forced to work from home without pay and be forced to use their PTO if they want to be paid?

Seems like it should be illegal to me but maybe I'm just blowing it out of the water. IF all this blows over, they'd be denied any time off for personal reasons or otherwise health related. Many public agencies cover their office workers with a sort of Crisis/Health leave policy, and it seems generally the people in the field get screwed.

The working class gets a slap to the face during all this.

I see a lot of people talking about concerns for the elderly, which is extremely valid and correct. However, please take care to remember your family, friends, and neighbors with chronic illnesses, respiratory illnesses, heart illnesses and so on.

I have cystic fibrosis. For those who are unfamiliar it is a genetic disease of the lungs and digestive system. It is hard to convey the seriousness of this illness, but think of it as being on a somewhat similar level as cancer. I have spent 22 years fighting tooth and nail for a somewhat normal lung function. I have sacrificed 2-4 hours every single day of my life to airway clearance, I have taken roughly 20+ pills every single day (though this has improved with time), have been hospitalized, have had sinus surgery, have had a bronchoscopy. When I was born, I was not supposed to see my prom; I wasn't supposed to graduate high school. The average lifespan was 20-30 (and even now, it is 39). I have made so many sacrifices in my social/personal life just to pursue an education and function normally.

I don't want to die, and even if I don't, I've come too far to permanently lose an additional 20-30% lung function. This virus can change the entire course of my life. You, stranger, can change the entire course of my life. I can guarantee that this will either kill me or destroy my lungs in one, irrecoverable blow should I get it. I may look normal, I may even look healthy. But myself and many others are being forced to take more extreme precautions and to quarantine even more intensely.

To those who are going out and not being careful, who are writing this off, you are directly putting my life and the lives of others in danger. It's easy to justify negligence when you don't have to look someone in the eyes and know you are impacting their life. Well, here is someone. If I'm not enough, look to your parents or grandparents. Look to other CF patients. Look to your neighbor with diabetes. Look to the friend you know who has asthma. Look at yourself. Please. If you don't believe in vaccines or the severity of this virus, fine. But to make this work, people like you need to try. We need to all be in this together. Please stay home or do everything you can to, and I sincerely hope we all pull through.",Connecticut,Please don't forget those with chronic illness

How many of you know someone who knows someone who has the virus?
 
If the incubation period is so long, and testing is just getting ramped up and 80% of those infected are barely impacted, isn’t this thing everywhere already?
 
But how many of you know someone who’s been laid off, furloughed or had their hours reduced? And what about for you. What’s more likely at this point? You get sick from the virus or you get laid off? Given your risk factors, which scenario would be worse for you and those that depend on you?
 
With malls closed, restaurants partially closed, many business doing work from home, and everyone being encouraged to self quarantine, an economic hell is about to be unleashed. Even businesses that are staying open are slowing down dramatically.
 
How many thousands of people in your state have been laid off for EACH singular case of the coronavirus?
 
Based on unemployment claims in the first 4 days this week, Connecticut is looking at 40,000 in just one week. That’s 400 people out of work for EVERY SINGLE positive test so far. That’s 1700 people who have lost their job for EVERY SINGLE hospitalization thus far. And that’s before the mall closures that go into effect tonight.
 
Is that smart?

3,250 people have died from this virus in the last four months in China, a country of 1.3 billion people. 25,000 people have been laid off because of the virus (?) so far this week in Connecticut, a state of 3.5 million people. Does this make sense? Is this our best possible option?
 
This is already crushing the poor. It’ll crush the middle class soon too. This is not sustainable. And yet, all we hear is about closures and shut downs deepening, not letting up any time soon.
 
Why aren’t we talking about how in Connecticut this winter, 2300+ have been hospitalized for the flu, and only 23 hospitalized for the virus thus far? Obviously those numbers will change, but where were Ned Lamont’s daily press conferences and daily executive orders for a flu outbreak that - to date - is 100 times more severe than what we’re experiencing right now? Where was the pressing need to shut everything down and shelter in place? Why wasn’t it okay then to sacrifice people’s livelihoods for the common good? It may spread faster and be more lethal, but we don’t know that for certain yet and we certainly don’t know to what degree.
 
I’m glad that we’re paying attention. This virus deserves our attention and we ought to make sacrifices. But our attention seems to be staggeringly one dimensional.
 
Why aren’t we talking about Italy in perspective? What’s happening there is horrific. It’s tragic. Parts of it were avoidable to be sure. Italy is a country of 60 million people. If Italy’s number of dead triple, and their rate of infection and death ends up coming to pass here, adjusting for our population, 54,000 Americans will die - which matches the upper limit of the CDC’s estimate for the number of flu deaths in the US this year (55,000). Why no outrage then? Why no social distancing? Because we were used to it? Or because we had no idea it was going on?
 
Are Italy and the US the same? Italy is older. They smoke more. I’m sure their population density in some of their areas of outbreak is far higher than the majority of America too. For every reason we worry that we’ll become Italy, we have reasons to believe we won’t.
 
The Italian government released a study yesterday of 1,000+ of the Coronavirus deaths. 99% of those that died had preexisting conditions. The overwhelming majority were seniors. Did they deserve to die? Of course not. Should we just let them? Of course not. But this is what happens every year and in every country. This strain is novel. But the flu kills. The common cold kills. Slips and falls kill. Cars kill. But they never get the focus of the global community in the same way, and we’ve come to coexist with their risks. How can we mitigate the risk of this virus without annihilating everything else in the process?
 
And what’s less normal? A respiratory virus killing thousands like we see every year but pay little attention to, or a global shutdown?
 
Yes, this virus is worse. Yes people will die. Yes death is tragic. Yes I’m sure this will be personal for me too. Maybe I’ll get it. Maybe I’ll die. Who knows. Death is always a guarantee. But where is our healthy sense of skepticism and concern for the collateral damage wrought by all of our countermeasures?
 
If you look at incidences that have begun to get under control: China, South Korea, Diamond Princess - it’s entirely possible that this thing winds up being far less bad than many of the estimates contributing to the hysteria. Of course we know so little that it’s likely that it becomes far worse too. We don’t know.
 
People are scared. And I think it’s responsible to shut things down or at least scale back considerably for a few weeks to try to slow the spread and give our healthcare system the opportunity to prepare. And to be clear: I don’t think this is remotely political. This isn’t a conspiracy. So we can absorb a few weeks of shutdown, and we should. I’m not suggesting we be reckless or cavalier. We have to value life.
 
But months? Do we have any idea what that means?
 
The death and devastation wrought by the economic depression that this will trigger will far outpace anything this virus can throw at us, won’t it? How can it not? There’s only so many trillions the Fed can print and spend. And yet nearly all of us are sitting back and virtue signaling about our willingness to do what we’re told without asking the critical questions that need asking. Why?

Thank you for your reaching out.  &amp;nbsp;

We're very sorry that some have taken offense to this email.  I believe our owner's intent was simply to communicate to members that their membership dues had been stopped during our forced shutdown, and at the same time, relay the facts as they were posted on the CDC website at that time, not as reported by the media, in an effort to calm the panic some may feel when faced with the unknown. We do understand that this is a very quickly evolving situation.  &amp;nbsp;

The team at Big Sky supports everyone’s individual right to make their own choices.  We agree that anyone who feels like they are at risk should absolutely avoid situations that make them feel uncomfortable, avoiding public places such as this and social gatherings.   &amp;nbsp;

Again, please accept my apology if our email felt insensitive, as I'm sure that was not the intent.  &amp;nbsp;

I don't have a car, I am low income and now unemployed. I rented a car and drove around New Haven county and got some food (but not a ton, because a lot of stores were out) in early March.

It has literally not gotten better since the start of the month. A week and a half ago, I tried everything -- I use a lot of pickup services because I rent a car hourly and get severe migraines from in-store lighting. Most of my food was substituted out and unavailable. 

I also have food allergies. It seems that when the hoarders are running out of normal food, they are raiding my allergy-safe food -- its much more expensive, why are you this desperate?

I am down to my last bottle of hand soap and last few rolls of TP. I have a few oz of disinfectant left. Oh, and my produce delivery box got cancelled due to local demand being too high to fill. 

I am now quarantined until I can get tested (there is a waiting list in CT)  because I fit the profile to a T. No groceries. Very little soap. No disinfectant.

Cut and paste from MS Outlook disabled the links though.

Some important info here especially about unemployment.

Dear Mr. xxx,

While we all work together to help our communities through this public health emergency, I want my office to be a resource for you and your family to find the latest information and guidance on any questions you might have. Below, I’ve compiled a quick update on some of the latest news regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, and important information about resources that are becoming available to help families, workers, and businesses through this period of economic contraction.

As Congress continually works to respond to the needs of the American people, and as this crisis evolves, I will regularly update you with additional legislative action and resources. This is not an all-encompassing list of the response efforts in the works, and much more information will be available as we continue our work.

First and foremost, to find the latest information from the **Center for Disease Control** and the **Connecticut Department of Public Health**, please visit their websites, linked here:

My office has also pulled together helpful links, resources, and information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak on my website, which can be found here

**Resources for Small Businesses**

You may be interested to know that the **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is now offering low-interest federal disaster loans for working capital to Connecticut small businesses and non-profits** suffering substantial economic injury as a result of COVID-19. Any Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance declaration issued by the SBA makes loans available to small businesses and private, non-profit organizations in designated regions, including Connecticut, to help alleviate economic injury caused by COVID-19.

These loans offer up to $2 million in assistance and can be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other bills at an interest rate of 3.75% for small businesses and 2.75% for non-profits. Loan repayment terms are capped at 30 years, and are defined on a case-by-case basis based on a borrower’s ability to repay.

How to apply:

* Applicants may apply online, receive additional disaster assistance information and download applications at [https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&amp;cid=CT02JC&amp;crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fdisasterloan.sba.gov%2fela&amp;redir_log=781004530023224).
* Applicants may also call SBA’s Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955 or email [disastercustomerservice@sba.gov](mailto:disastercustomerservice@sba.gov)for more information on SBA disaster assistance. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may call (800) 877-8339.

**Resources for Veterans**

Serving our nation’s veterans has always been one of my top priorities in Congress, and it always will be. If you are a veteran with any health concerns surrounding COVID-19, give your local Veterans Administration (VA) facility a call immediately – if you don’t know where it is, just call my office and we’ll help you locate it.

**Information on Unemployment Insurance for Workers**

Last week, the House passed another bipartisan legislative package aimed at providing aid to the thousands of Americans impacted by the economic contraction brought on by COVID-19. Included in this latest package were some critical provisions for American families and workers facing lost hours and income, like greatly enhanced unemployment insurance.

Yesterday, the Senate passed our bill on to the President’s desk, and last night it was signed into law. My office will be releasing information and updates regarding this package as they come. In the meantime, there are some existing programs now that people can begin to take advantage of.

If you are unemployed due to the COVID-19 public health emergency and are seeking benefits, or if you’re an employer seeking additional information, please visit [http://www.filectui.com/](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&amp;cid=CT02JC&amp;crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.filectui.com%2f&amp;redir_log=635020194325167).

Additional guidance:

* Do not delay filing your claim for unemployment benefits even if your employer has not issued you any paperwork. It is important to file as soon as you become unemployed to avoid being denied benefits.
* For faster processing of your claim, please have your employer’s registration number and a return to work date readily available when you file your claim online.
* If you have additional questions regarding your claim, you should first visit the Connecticut Department of Labor’s Online Assistance Center at [www.filectui.com](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&amp;cid=CT02JC&amp;crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.filectui.com&amp;redir_log=236110509735164). Live chat is available for questions concerning unemployment compensation, including the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the program.
* You may also submit your general question to [dol.webhelp@ct.gov](mailto:dol.webhelp@ct.gov). A response can be expected in 3 to 5 business days, depending on volume.

**Paid Sick and Family Leave**

As part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Congress passed emergency paid sick leave and emergency paid family leave to ensure that working people who need to take time off from work either because they are sick or because their children are home from school can continue to receive paychecks and pay their bills. Employers will be reimbursed from the federal government for the costs of paying their workers at this time.

For more information about these provisions and how they might impact you as an employer or employee, [please see my press release about the bill here](https://iqconnect.lmhostediq.com/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&amp;cid=CT02JC&amp;crop=15442.56821461.6182593.7820540&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fcourtney.house.gov%2fmedia-center%2fpress-releases%2fcourtney-statement-senate-approval-house-passed-covid-19-&amp;redir_log=170595964668781).

**Access Health CT Special Enrollment Period**

2207,SpermicidalManiac666,1584716008,flwas7,Nan,"I live in what I consider to be the best neighborhood in the entire state.  I can list five businesses within a three minute walk of my apartment that I would be DEVASTATED to see go out of business because they couldn't last through this crisis.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford to regularly spend money at these establishments and I feel a responsibility to continue doing that through this mess despite places being outright closed or only doing take out.   Many of them are really at risk of going out of business through no fault of their own.  Ideally, landlords will have mercy on them and give them a pass for a few months.  Hopefully vendors with whom they have a line of credit will do the same.  But if that's not the case, they need your help to continue covering their expenses.

My favorite watering hole is basically a block away from my apartment.  My wife and I have been living in this neighborhood for two years and we've come to know and love so many people here.  That especially includes the bar owners and their entire staff.  I feel awful for what they're all having to struggle through right now.  On any given week, we spend between $50 - $100 at that bar between the bill and tips (might be a little higher but I don't want to sound like too much of a lush so we'll keep the numbers lower for this).  I tip the bartenders generally $10 to $20 every time - if my bill was under $50, I'll still give $10 - if it was over $50 I usually just put $20 down.  I was a bartender/waiter for many years so I just always give pretty sizable tips no matter where I am.  

My plan is to take the money I budget for going out and either order takeout or buy gift cards through the entirety of this quarantine.  Additionally, I plan on finding the venmo accounts of the bartenders and servers I see regularly and sending them the amount of money I'd typically tip them on any given week.  

I think if you have places like that in your life and you're not at risk of losing your job in the middle of this, you have a responsibility to help places like this and also try to convince others to do the same.  One of the main reasons my neighborhood is so great is specifically because of these neighbors I'm talking about.  They are anchors of the place.  Additionally, those places and others just like them are the pillars of our broader economy.  Not Home Depot, not Walmart, not Amazon - small businesses run by entrepreneurs who took a chance and INVESTED in your neighborhoods and towns.  These establishments foster a sense of community - you see people you know there, you get to know the staff, they feel like home and that's because they are.  Home isn't just the four walls you sleep in.  It's not just the borders of the city, or state, or country you live in.  It's the web of people and places that make up your periphery and bring life to the world.  

Please, please, please support these places.  I know there's countless amounts of people who are suffering as well and this is not meant to ignore them.  Help your neighbors who got laid off and furloughed - they need your help too.  Invite them over for dinner, buy them some extra groceries if you're able. 

Your neighbors need you and they'll have your back when you need them.  

TLDR:  Not giving you one - you have plenty of time to read this :)",Connecticut,Please support your local small businesses.

From an ER doctor in NYC. The situation will be similar in CT soon enough. 

1) The ED (emergency department) is now separated into two areas: one for traditional emergencies and what has been dubbed, “The COVID pit.”

2) A vast majority of folks in the COVID pit aren’t sick enough for any intervention and because of that fact, they cannot test them for COVID unless they are being admitted for breathing difficulties.

3) Those “worried-well” folk jamming up the ED all have to get seen by law. So they (doctors/nurses) have to change into new clean protective-wear to talk to them. They (doctors) wind up giving them Tylenol (which costs the patient like $300) and sending them home. Now, they’ve just wasted a set of clean protective-wear. The reason we’re in such a dire shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff is because these worried people come and need to be seen. STAY HOME UNLESS YOU HAVE SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

I made a ""Spring Safari"" scavenger hunt with things like robins, dirt, flowers, bird baths and so on. Planning on using it to encourage the kiddo to get out of the house -- maybe have her use a camera to take photos of things she finds.

We have some small boxes, thinking of using those to make stages or dioramas, then use paper and popsicle sticks to make paper puppets that can play in the scenes. Might also be used as a writing exercise e.g. write out the script.

Trying to avoid a lot of screen or computer time, but there are some high quality resources out there. Here are two NYT articles that look helpful:

For three weeks, I continued receiving benefits at a reduced rate after reporting my new job, as expected.

Also, I am concerned that if I quit my part-time job due to fears of contracting coronavirus, that I will absolutely stop receiving any benefits. This is very important to me because, in a week at the job I make the same amount I was receiving in benefits. I have asthma, I work in food service and I'm very concerned about contracting coronavirus, as I've read some horror stories of people who have asthma ending up on ventilators when they catch COVID-19.

Invisible Hands is a volunteer organization dedicated to delivering groceries and supplies to community members that are most at-risk for severe COVID-19 interactions. While most operations are currently limited to New York City, the Invisible Hands team is making significant efforts to expand across the country.

I'm reaching out to ask for volunteers for the state of Connecticut. I'm also looking to reach out to elderly care homes, supermarkets, and anywhere else that at-risk individuals frequent to advertise these services - but first, we need a solid base of volunteers in every county across the state. Unless you live in an urban or downtown area, having a personal vehicle (car, bike, etc) is a MUST for getting around this state. The wider the coverage, the more people can be served.

Please apply to Invisible Hands via the link attached. Please note that the **absolute requirements** for volunteering are that **you are feeling healthy, are displaying no symptoms, have not traveled out of the country in the past 14 days, have not come into contact with a sick person in the past 14 days, and, mostly importantly, have been practicing social distancing by avoiding crowded or populated areas since the start of the COVID-19 crisis.**

For example, my bill is for 200 megs upload and 100 download. But routinely from 10am -3 pm during the day (recently) it comes to a snails pace 5meg up and 1 meg down (at best). Yet, the bill I pay is still for the full 200 meg package. I called up my provider and they flat out told me “no credits, try hitting the modem reset button”. 

Shouldn’t there be a method to credit back customers bills for lack of service?  

I’m not necessarily angry with the slow service, cuz I get why it happening, but I am a bit annoyed that it feels like a bit of unfair advantage / gaming happening when it comes to the price I pay for the level of service received. 

It’s almost as if the “variable rate” language only works to the providers benefit and to the customers detriment.",Connecticut,Internet service providers

In reality it could be taken care of tomorrow but they space out releases purposefully so it doesn't look as bad to higher ups (guessing they're also going to write in an excuse for why I backed out instead of the truth). Yesterday my old army recruiter asked me if I'd still join if they could get me a different job, meaning they haven't even started the process of releasing me, he told me he had ""no idea"" how long that would take so the 90 day thing might be out the window.

&amp;#x200B;

My air force recruiter is now recommending I write a letter to my congressperson (rosa). I realize she has bigger crises to deal with atm but I don't see any point in waiting or not trying, my predicament is sorta corona adjacent in that it's particularly hard for me to find a job and support myself while the army has me in indefinite limbo (I can't tell a potential employer if I'll be here for 3 months or 6 for example). I also figure this must be happening on a broader scale (I'm older and less naive than most enlistees, so if it happened to me it could happen to anyone thinking of joining the army)  so it's probably affecting many of her constituents on a regular basis.

But the moment I heard about it—the Wuhan flu; it’s also the Wuhan, or WuHAAN—that’s a city in China. Many people don’t know that. But the moment I heard about this Chinese flu, I ordered a test. And it’s an amazing test. We do better testing than anywhere in the world. Some say the Germans have the best tests, but they don’t. Our tests are even better.

So you’re positive for Corona. And usually “positive” is a positive word—it’s a very good word, frankly. Everybody thinks it’s good, apart from what you hear on the news—which is fake. It’s largely fake. But in medicine, “positive” is not so good. So it’s very confusing. And I’ve always been very clear about that. Some say “positive” is always good, but I’ve never agreed with that.

So you’re positive for the Corona. But you’ll be fine. Totally fine. You might think you’re going to die—and everybody does die, eventually. But you’ll be fine. You feel fine, right? You won’t need a ventilator. There are no ventilators—but you won’t need one. 

How old are you, 55? You won’t need one. Some people need a ventilator, and they’re amazing machines. Did you know the first ventilator was made by Henry Ford? It’s an incredible piece of equipment. But you’ll be fine.

The virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. But you have two of them. Some say you have a spare. Some people only have one lung. It’s true. But I don’t talk about spares. I always want both. Given a choice, I want two lungs.

So I’ve asked nurse—what’s your name, Nancy?—I’ve asked nurse Nancy to keep you comfortable. And Nancy is one of our finest nurses. I mean, just look at her. Incredible, right? Nancy, you’re really incredible. You’re not afraid of Corona, are you, the Chinese Plague? I didn’t think so. Nancy will bring you whatever you need.

I'm now asking for your help! I may be able to speak only for myself and my situation but I'm sure that there are many many other people that are putting high risk people in serious danger. Ask the Governor if he really believes the state can not go a few weeks without lawns mowed, pools opened, and bicycles repaired. Ask him why he chose to use such nondescript terminology when defining those jobs that are and arent essential. Finally please by all means use my personal story if you feel it will help the case.

Have no doubt that this is a serious health crisis and the only way we will be able to ensure our hospitals do not reach the state that our neighbors in New York are in is if we take serious action right now. Of course a big thank you from myself and my mother to each and everyone of you who take the time to do this. Below is a link you can use to send an email. Seriously, thank you.

Lately I've been yearning to move back to my home state. But since for various reasons that's unlikely to happen, I've been ""assuaging"" (really, intensifying) my homesickness by reflecting on the things I miss about Connecticut, things with which Vermont just can't compete.

If you've lived in Connecticut but don't at present, what does the state have going for it that the place you currently reside does not?

Here's my list. (For the record, I bear the Green Mountain State no ill will. It's just not where I want to be.)

1. **Climate**. How quaint to think I used to complain about CT winters. For a guy who doesn't dig cold-weather sports much beyond the occasional snowshoe excursion, winters up here can be rough. They start earlier, bite harder, and linger longer.
2. **Hiking**. I know, it sounds nuts to claim Connecticut's hiking beats Vermont's, but for me, there's no contest. Vermont boasts taller mountains, grander vistas, and larger swaths of wilderness, but where I live in the Champlain Valley it can be surprisingly difficult to find decent trails. For one thing, there are far fewer trees in this region of the state than just about anywhere in CT, so forested day hikes are scarce. Mud keeps some paths closed until well into spring, and the bugs are a force to be reckoned with. Then there are the crowds. On a nice day up here, odds are you'll run into *lots* of bodies out for a jaunt. CT has its popular spots, to be sure, but I find it's much easier to access places where one could find solitude even on a gorgeous summer weekend (the state forest across the street from my childhood home, for instance, where in years of tramping through the woods I've encountered about half a dozen souls).
3. **Culture**. Vermont isn't known for its museums or theaters (except, perhaps, Bread and Puppet, if you want to make the haul to the Northeast Kingdom). In CT, there was at least New Haven and the Wadsworth in Hartford. Plus, for a pittance, I could hop on a train, crack a beer, and a couple hours later step be wandering around NYC.
4. **The ocean**. If Long Island Sound wouldn't cut it, Rhode Island's waves were only a drive up the shore.
5. **Affordable flights**. I don't like thinking about the number of times I've dealt with border crossings and customs to avoid paying an arm and a leg.",Connecticut,What does CT do better?

My boyfriend also has symptoms as well as my dad (63yo). And none of us can get tested because we do not have coughs or fevers (yet) but most likely have it.

Anyways like the title says, the number of cases is very much so A MINIMUM because they are only among those who were able to get tested. So, if there’s no cases in your town yet it could mean nobody has been tested. The tests are in such high demand and those who are very sick take priority (like they should).

Anyways, stay home",Connecticut,"The # of reported positive corona cases is WAY lower than the actual amount, so if your town has zero it doesn’t mean it’s safe to go out!"

I opened a new claim over a week ago and got the second email from the DOL saying I have been processed, they are currently verifying employment status and the claim is on temp hold for 8 days and to follow the steps below to prevent delay in payment which basically states to wait till Sunday(today) to file. I just tried to apply and it won't let me. To be precise when I go to file a weekly claim and log in then click file a continued claim it says I'm ineligible because I didn't file for the previous week.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now, I already filed a claim like it said and got the return email, of course I didn't file the previous week since it's my first time filing. I can't even call for help because they aren't open and the CT DOL site literally says not to call them about unemployment assistance.

What should I do? File a new claim again and hope it works?",Connecticut,Unemployment issue help

If you work at a business, or know about a business, that is illegally operating even though they are not one of those classifications than call your local police (you can find their numbers on most town webpages).

I grew up 18 years in Middlesex County and still hold a decent amount of pride for my home state.  It taught me a lot and informed a lot of my current world view.

I have seen articles and data in recent years that Connecticut is one of a few states that is going to see negative population growth from the 2010 census to the 2020 census.  My brother still lives in Connecticut and my parents moved away recently so I still get a little bit of the politics and such and sounds like finances are rough, but I'm sure you guys have your ears a lot more to the ground than I do.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Originally before the mandatory shut down, I applied for partial unemployment because my hours were cut from 40 to 16. The following week the state ordered the shut down, so now the 16 hours I originally claimed I would be working are 0 hours because we are closed.

My unemployment claim doesn't let me go in to adjust this change. When I applied, I received an email saying that I am part of the ""temporary work shut down"" and I do not need to apply every Sunday, that I will just automatically be getting paid. The problem is the payment I'm getting is incorrect because it thinks I am working (since claim was filed before the closing). 

I have tried editing it online but it doesn't allow me to. I've called and not gotten through because they are swamped. Does anyone know if I'm doing something wrong? Should I file a new claim that updates me? I just don't want to do the wrong thing.

Wilton was the town that truly caught our eyes as it boasts stunning homes, unmatched serenity, and a (seemingly) reasonable commute to Grand Central Terminal. Admittedly, I am reluctant to leave my current school in Manhattan, and the city in general. Being that I've lived all over Manhattan my entire life, I am not at all accustomed to Connecticut and have several concerns. Conversely, though, I can also foresee a beautiful life there as space is not an issue and it is very disparate from the bustling streets of Manhattan. If you couldn't already tell, I don't want to ""lose"" the city as I truly do cherish it. Thus, my primary concern with Wilton lies in its commute. Is it feasible to travel to and from the Upper West Side from Wilton each day, as I will need to do? Would driving be a better option than the train? Can I head to the city easily whenever it is I feel like it? If I wanted to go to Little Italy, for instance, would it be a massive ordeal?   


Any information regarding Wilton and its commute to Manhattan is greatly appreciated. Please bear in mind that this is a significant decision.

Like many people I recently lost my employment and applied for unemployment insurance.  I just got this email tonight, telling me to follow this new process to try to process my claim quicker.  It provides the accurate link to the DOL website.  Then it prompts you to click a blue button on the page (for filing a new claim) but tells you to follow the tutorial that is attached to the email.  When you go to click into the tutorial it prompts you to enter your Username and Password.  I entered my correct username and password and it keeps telling me the information I entered is incorrect.  When you click out of the password box it tells you the sight is password protected.  Is this a scam or not?  Has anyone else encountered this?  Did I just give up my information?

&amp;#x200B;

* [For faster claims processing, have your return-to-work date, if known, and your employer’s registration number readily available.   Answer YES to the question “Do you have a DEFINITE return to work date after today?”](https://uiclaimsct.force.com/Customers)

You can eat almost nothing,

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

You don't need to have employees talking loudly at the entrance yelling to the other employee at the RedBox foyer area while patrons are passing through in close proximity.  She was not wearing a mask. Its not good hygiene in a pandemic.

And for that older worker standing at the door yelling at the patron that brought his own spray bottle of what looked to be a bleach solution. You dont have to yell while approaching him like that; I can see why he was backing away form you like that. He was wearing a mask and giving you the thumbs up letting you know he understood what you were telling him (not to use his bottle because you had cleaned all the carts yourselves and you dont want mysterious chemicals on the cart handles) but you kept yelling and approaching him as he kept acknowledging that that he understood with the thumbs up.  You didn't even have a mask on. You yelling was like you sneezing. All you had to do was calmly in a low voice tell him and not keep approaching him and yelling with your breath and spit flying. Its not good hygiene in a pandemic.

And to the 2 patron girls that waltzed in with smug faces talking loudly strutting down the middle of the main aisle not giving anyone more than 2ft and that poor elderly person that tried to avoid you, look around and get with the program. Its not good hygiene in a pandemic. 

**Possible solution to avoid that employee having to yell:**

Maybe have a sign for people not to bring their own disinfectant or use their own chemicals on the carts. I read some articles telling people they should do so. CDC suggests to do so why does Walmart not come out and dispute this.
