When I got sick and couldn't work I had to get out because my property tax was 6 grand a year there. The crime here is laughable compared to a metro area,it's just methheads getting busted and shoplifter's at Walmart. I can't believe the stuff that is in the police reports, it would not even make the paper where I used to live .  The locals are good, friendly people, everyone waves when you drive by. The government is almost non existent,no codes,no fines for stupid property code violations ,you can build what you want. The cops aren't out to collect revenue,and are actually real people,not militarized government thugs. Property tax is dirt cheap. The only issue is the job market sucks and the pay is a joke, my wife is the bread winner ,and the same job at the hospital in Illinois paid 17,and it's 11 here. Mostly minimum wage crap,and Tennessee minimum wage is a joke. They have no health insurance help, so of you need expensive medical care ,your on your own.  If you like big city stuff like shopping and nightlife, your out of luck, there isn't anything here. Almost all the restaurants suck badly, but Knoxville is an hour away,and so is all the touristy stuff in Gatlinburg/Sevierville/pigeon forge. I'm just east of Newport,and I haven't had anything stolen,and I leave my shed unlocked and occasionally something valuable in the driveway. I'm comfortable leaving my doors unlocked. I'm right outside Del Rio, and they have a reputation for not liking outsiders,but I haven't had any issues,it's just what all the locals say.   It's very 2A friendly here, so if your on the left side of the political spectrum, you won't be welcome. There's always someone shooting on their property, you hear gunfire all day.

I've made small talk with neighbors and people when I do get out, everyone is very friendly though. There are also a lot of people from other states who moved here to escape taxes. I'm in heaven here,I was a displaced redneck my entire life, and I can hardly do redneck stuff now.  Newport has a lot of the basic stuff like Walmart,Lowe's,and all the fast food junk,so everything you need is 10 to 15 minutes away. Amazon takes 2 to 4 days instead of the same or next day. My wife misses the big stores, but Morristown is about 1/2 hour away and has a small mall. If you do look at property make sure internet is available,the county just launched a fiber network last year because none of the cable companies service much of the area, but it's a slow process building it and not much is covered yet. Another issue is cell service ends a few miles east of Newport,and only Verizon and AT&amp;T have OK coverage in the area,with a little bit of US Cellular, Sprint and T-Mobile don't have signals except in Newport and along I-40. It's a complete cell dead zone from Del Rio to past the North Carolina State line. All the coverage maps lie.

Thankfully, I am not in the dangerous areas (about 30-40 miles away). On the bad days Sydney is covered in smoke, just as you said, and the smell of charcoal can linger for hours, if not days.  And on the really bad days we can have ash ""snowing"" down us. With that said, my family and I are among the safe, lucky ones. 

Alot of the areas being impacted are small communities just like those among the back roads in Tennessee. The people affected are just like my fellow Tennesseans that I grew up with. These are good people in good communities that are losing their homes, their possessions and, in some cases, their lives. 

If you can't donate money (it is coming after the Christmas season, understandably), please spare a thought and some prayers for these very good people. Even a good message of support over Facebook may mean the world to the people here (RFS groups on Facebook).

I am a late 30s man around 6 foot 200 pounds.  I am also a fist degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  So why does that matter?  It matters because now matter how you look at it, I am overweight and a proven mediocre fighter.  I've never won first in tournament.  The only reason I get second is because there are only three of us.   You want to go see something funny, go to one of the tournaments at a high school gym and make sure to stick around for the adult 40-50 year old green belts.  You've never seen grown men look more ridiculous in your life!

Back to the point, in my training, I sometimes spar women of various ages and sizes.  The first time I was kicked in the back of the head by a 5 foot 110 pound 19 year old girl at my school was a rather humbling experience.  This specific student is a national champ and has reached some the highest tiers of women's competition in the country.  She is more flexible, quicker, and has better technique than I ever will.  She has worked her ass off and earned every single one of the  state and national wins on her belt.  She is a beast and I have the utmost respect for her.  I will never achieve her level of proficiency or skill, and cherish each opportunity I get to learn from her when we spar.

That said, while she can certainly hold her own, there are some black belt men at her level and higher that she will never best.  Height, weight, speed and power simply make the competition unfair.  These guys aren't even necessarily very good, but a simple block and side kick would send this girl into the bleachers.  In the right circumstance, even my mediocre side kick would do this very thing.  This is not hysterics.  This is no scarecrow. This is truth.

I have trouble seeing the ethical side for allowing some Pat, Sam or Chris to scoop up the accolades which rightly belong to women like the one who puts in so much sweat and tears my school.  She is a beast and deserves to be seen as one.  If some Pat, Sam or Chris wins instead, would you call that person a beast or would you subconsciously go ""yeah, but...""?  I guarantee those elite women who got bested are.  Allowing biological men to compete physically against biological women seems contrary to good sportsmanship and honest competition.

We shouldn't force these young women to be spectators in their own sports.""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/connecticut-transgender-athletes-face-federal-discrimination-complaint-from-females-over-title-ix-violations/)

I don't know what the solution is, maybe a transgender class? I certainly don't want to say they can't participate, but if I knew there were going to be several ""identify females"" at whatever competition, race, fight, tournament, whatever....well I would probably wonder, ""Why bother?""

Also, I'm curious about the long-term effects of estrogen on bone density. One thing I find compelling is that sexual characteristics controlling athleticism are definitely bimodal, but there is a surprising amount of overlap. Many cisgender women have naturally occurring advantages that are more in line with male athletes.

I guess my opinion is that the science of transgenderism is real. It's a real thing that exists in a subset of the population. I'm not sure it's realistic to make a transgender-focused class, though.

Mouse creek falls is awesome, smooth 4ish mile hike but you have some bonuses along the way like a swimming hole and other smaller falls. Watch out for the horse shit on the trail tho.

674,Screamin_STEMI,"This is something I‚Äôve followed very closely for the better part of ten years and is a subject I feel I‚Äôve managed to become somewhat educated on. 

Unfortunately bow fishing hasn‚Äôt actually proven very effective way of controlling them. It seems like it would be but the data says otherwise. If the carp are able to successfully spawn one time the lake will be totally overrun. Fortunately the conditions required for them to successfully spawn don‚Äôt come about very often. Kentucky and Barkley lakes has been heavily bowfished for years now and those waterways have still been completely overrun. Sure it might take out some but it truly is a drop in the bucket of those things are able to successfully spawn **one**‚Äôtime. A thousand carp in an established population after a spawn is truly nothing. 
The only thing so far that has proven to control numbers on a large scale is heavy, sustained, species targeted commercial fishing. However that itself has issues because there aren‚Äôt a ton of processing plants in the mid south that process carp so it‚Äôs not economically feasible in many cases for these commercial fishermen who are out there trying to make a living to target Asian carp at the moment. Government subsidies and other programs are starting to help with that but there is a long way to go. 

Some new methods are being used by state and federal agencies that may prove fruitful but the jury is still out. 

Asian carp are far and away the biggest threat to the Tennessee and Cumberland river systems today. Not only do they decimate native game fish but they ruin entire ecosystems because their food source is the zooplankton that is the gasoline for the proverbial motor that is our fisheries and the amount these fish consume on simply a daily basis is staggering. 

Not only do they decimate fisheries but they also have an impact on general water recreation. Makes it awfully dangerous to water ski at 20mph when a 10lb carp can come out of nowhere jumping and smoke you in the head. All that equals less revenue from lodging, restaurants, gasoline, etc. and has a major impact on small communities near these waterways that rely on those things as a large part of their economy. 

Check out waroncarp.com. They do some very good work and help give incentives to commercial fishermen to target the carp and also raise awareness about the issue in general. 

I absolutely cannot overstate what a massive issue this is for our state and the entire mid south.",1578977718,fecmocb

Also, if this IS about religion there are plenty of non-Christian adoption agencies. I‚Äôm not saying sexuality discrimination is okay, it is not.

Meanwhile the wealthy get HUGE savings on their homes, put nothing into the pot from their income to help the poorer members of their community, and still get to skate by sales tax by getting to take advantage of a reduced tax on luxury items. 

The result: poor people pay more taxes proportional to their income and consumption in order to benefit the rich. That is ass fucking backwards.

904,Patri_Arky,"&gt; Who are ""those calling"" for a tax on the poor to pay off student loan debt?

The ignorant people who think that poor people aren't actually heavily taxed, and ignore that some of that flows to wealthier people. That is, everyone who calls for taxpayers to pay student loan debt. The premise that the poor don't end up paying for government is demonstrably false.

&gt; I don't agree that a tax on the wealth of the super rich is correctly categorized as a tax on poor people.

Continued study will teach you that the wealthy *never actually* pay *all* that governments promise will be extorted from them. What happens instead is that owners of capital flee when costs and risks outweigh potential profit. Why play a rigged game? Take your chips and leave the casino. Then businesses collapse and jobs disappear and the people who were promised a slice of the extorted pie are worse off than when the process started.

Authoritarians pretend that they can point the guns of the government at wealthy people and get the outcomes they want. It just never actually turns out that way. They don't sit still and hand over their earnings. No one in their right mind would.

So who *really* benefits from low property taxes?

Any person who makes a statement like that has either a cognitive disability, a lack of education, or a problem with honesty. There's no point in engaging with them further.

To lay it out in detail: ""welfare queens"" are non-producers who live on the proceeds extorted from the producers, after the middlemen (government employees) have taken their cut for wages and benefits and after the bankers have taken their cut to ""service"" the government ""debt"". Avoiding extortion =/= receiving the proceeds of extortion (""living a life of luxury at the expense of the working poor""). The redditor to whom I replied hasn't a clue that their dogma has no basis in reality, QED.

The only sustainable way out of poverty yet discovered by man is capitalism. That is, the creation of wealth by individuals. Collectivists cannot comprehend that wealth is created, not merely confiscated. They view wealth as a zero sum game. Wealth creation societies provide more and new forms of employment, raising the standard of living for those not presently capable of deploying capital themselves (""employees"").

&gt;  
&gt;Washington County Chancery Court will review a complaint against Johnson City early next month that argues the City Commission did not follow the correct procedure when it approved the boundaries of an incentive district in Boones Creek.  
&gt;  
&gt;A court date is scheduled for 9 a.m. Feb. 3.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plaintiff, Johnson City attorney John Wood of Wood Patent Law, argues in court documents filed on Jan. 16 ‚Äî the same day commissioners were scheduled to cast their final vote on the boundaries ‚Äî that the city violated its ordinance adoption rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the filing, he claims the commission approved an incomplete first reading of the district boundaries and that the city altered the ordinance between second and third reading. He also writes that there has been¬†‚Äúongoing confusion‚Äù about the geographic parameters in the legislation that authorized the district, which Gov. Bill Lee signed into law in May.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wood‚Äôs filing was submitted as a complaint and request for injunctive relief, which asks that the court defer the City Commission‚Äôs vote on Jan. 16. But, now that the ordinance has been approved, Wood said Tuesday the question at hand is whether or not the ordinance is valid.

There are a ton of jobs at the bottom that are necessary for society to function and not nearly enough part-time high schoolers to fill them.

So, nstead I make tips. I average $18 an hour. Mostly because that's an average income for the people that go to my upscale restaurant.
Even though those restaurants operate national chains and even have their headquarters in other states. 
That upscale restaurant has put the burden on the customer the entire time. Promising me that the customer will pay silent taxes on everything, while not informing the customer of their responsibility. 

Many companies in Tennessee that list themselves as multi-state, like licensed truck driving and shipping companies, legally do not have to pay overtime.
Very recently I saw a union of workers take one of those companies to court , because what once was a small business had become an incredibly profitable company. Instead of moving that wealth throughout the company to people that had helped create that wealth, the company continued to take advantage of state laws that originally protected their business. They forged documents , funnelled money into dumb projects, and did everything they could to avoid going to overtime pay. 
The union won and the company is being forced to pay overtime because they are no longer a ""small business"" by any means. 
In response the company put its oldest members on salary and fired any one else. 

You all are afraid of companies backlashing against being forced to follow the laws. You say things like ""the price of milk will go up!"" 
But you dont realize that NOTHING is priced the way it should be as it is !

At the restaurant I work at now , you can order the promo combo ribs and steak for 18.99. But if I ring in a steak dinner (12.99) and add on ribs (2.99), same portion sizes for 3 dollars cheaper. 
These companies dont even bother to make their prices make sense. 
They throw numbers at you and if you can afford to pay it you dont blink.

I make 18 an hour, but I watch young servers get hired on and barely scrape by at $8. I watch them get a second job, at fucking McDonalds, because they can't pay their rent. Then they quit serving because it's so stressful and accept a $10 an hour raise to work 28 hours a week at mcdonalds.

Speaking generally, this isn't the case for all goods. Maybe not the case for most goods. Some things are very sensitive to cost, but plenty of things aren't. In may cases, people offset the increased cost in different ways, but in others they don't at all.

&gt;Labor costs contribute to total cost of any product.

Again, speaking generally, this isn't always true. Since workers tend to provide a net benefit, costs go up when you can't offset it with greater output or efficiency. Service jobs are huge example of this, while manufacturing would be more sensitive, seeing a larger variance with each new person.

In your case, it may be true that where you worked couldn't afford to raise wages, but it isn't universal. Where I work, it is the opposite, as we see large efficiency gains when we add people.

My point is that the costs are proportionate or universal. Some businesses will be hit, some will benefit from increased spending, employee reliability, and a wider pool of workers.

We're probably arguing two different points. I'm not against local municipalities having their own wages, but $15 is probably the minimum we want to shoot for, especially since increasing minimum wage is borderline impossible. 

Setting a high minimum to compensate for the decades of stagnant wages, then indexing it to inflation is probably ideal, but I think we should probably shoot for where wages would be if there weren't stagnant.

That doesn't really work in practice as businesses to operate in very specific niches, and it is difficult to remove a company from a niche. At a large scale, companies tend to get displaced by shifts in industry, but not by competitors.

Smaller companies that are ""crappy"" but run well also very difficult to compete with unless you have more resources than they do.

As angry I am about the bill it's ""no man's choice"" to give women a lawful choice to keep a baby that was unplanned thru tragic circumstances of certain sexual crimes or unexpected by certain events. It's WOMEN'S decision to take control over there bodies, not man's. If its kept by men's decisions by party politics then go to the adoption agencies and go see how over crowded those unplanned children there is. Why let them suffer the consequences of someone else's actions or reactions from an upbringing that they didn't choose. Yet again children are money if a woman cannot afford to keep the child then she has no other choice to give the child up for adoption. Does something like this makes motherhood bad? We're setting the future to fail at laws to makes decisions over unborn babies within the womb. As destructive the laws doesn't prove unfairness its certainly not fair to decide what's good for an unplanned family which will suffer financially and mentally throughout their well-being. If that's the case, then MEN need to be very afraid of what women can do by law. Let women vote for castration of an sexual crimes then, now let's see how men will get nervous and scared of that one. Just to stop rape and sexual assault or with a minor is more than enough to castrate and have longer jail time. Let's put it back into the hands of ""men's"" decisions over us. Let's give those guys that voted for this bill every child out of an adoption agencies, daycare centers, and other PP services and let them take care of every child they meet. They couldn't even handle it b/c they didn't bring those children into this world which they wouldn't care anyway but they'll see how hard it would be taking care of a child that was unplanned on their own. Also let's give them more hell where they rather promote rape culture over actions of useless, spineless, heartless men of this country when they choose to attack women than worry about not doing jail time nor feeling guilty when they rather commit the crime anyway.

No one in this audience believes that the mass of cells, that is similar to a proto-organ at these stages, has feelings, a soul, or anything defining as human.

They appreciate the weight of what they have to give up and usually must mourn the fact they simply cannot go through this at the moment, for any reason, tragic or otherwise.

Everyone's lives are deeply enriched by her presence, and she is relentlessly happy and cheerful.  If she had been aborted because of this,  i wouldn't see that as an act of mercy, but of eugenics and hatred.  I know that you and I likely define things differently and we'll never see eye-to-eye on this topic, but some of the most incredible people I have met have been those with disabilities. Both of us will end up incredulous at the other's response though from a complete difference in how we define ""life."" I'm a woman and I could not imagine choosing to have sex and then choosing not to use protection and then choosing to end the life that naturally gets created. I support abortion in rape and incest circumstances, but otherwise it was the choice of the woman (and the man) to create life. Killing that child is an awful act.

Years ago I was making $7.50 when the federal minimum went up to $7.25. I had been at that job for 4 years and gotten a number of pay raises to get to $7.50 but quit soon after the minimum went up because I didn't see any raise at all and people were getting hired on at $8 because the store was big on touting that they paid above minimum wage to attract new employees but didn't adjust previous employees pay to reflect it. What's even crazier is I moved across the state and went back to the company about a year later and was offered $10 an hour because the of the new minimum wage plus extra for experience with the company.

1376,GuardianDevil2,"The email that I sent to Governor Lee, which of course he ignored because his imaginary friend in the sky disagrees:  

&gt;I write in reference to proposed legislation HB 836/SB1304. Many people try to frame this as a religious freedom bill however there is more to this bill than merely an adoption agency‚Äôs ability to adhere to their religious beliefs. They are dealing with a third party with whom they have what could be considered a fiduciary relationship. This third party is the children under their care. These agencies‚Äô primary focus should be the well-being of these children.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some people will claim that kids are better off in a family with both a mother and a father. If we assume this is so, and I do not necessarily agree with this premise, we must also understand that we are not limited to only these two options, that is living without a family or living with a traditional family. I do not see how any rational person can claim that a kid is better off without a permanent family, compared to having two loving parents of the same sex.

&gt;Once we look at the situation from this perspective it becomes morally wrong to not allow same sex couples to adopt, subject to the same objective criteria as traditional couples. We would not be hurting only the same sex couples looking to start a family; we would be hurting the kids. We lack the moral authority to hurt the kids.

[Most of them.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/10/are-most-american-politicians-profiting-from-their-offices-not-according-to-this-data/)

&gt; new evidence from state financial records suggest that those high-profile accusations are the exception ‚Äî at least at the state level. Very few state lawmakers get rich while in office. Only the most electorally secure are financially rewarded while serving. Even then, they do not make much money for their efforts.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; Making money in office is rare. When politicians do manipulate their plum positions or political connections to get rich, citizens and the news media should not cynically dismiss such behavior as typical but treat it as an offensive aberration.

Except we've got an entire division in the Dept of Justice for that stuff - [The Office of International Affairs.](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-oia)  But instead of using the thousands of man-years of international expertise and massive resources of the DoJ, that exist to carry out the law, he asked a private attorney who [explicitly said he was working to achieve the President's personal interests.](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-rudy-giuliani-letter-destroys-trump-defense-ukraine-impeachment-2020-1)  

So it doesn't really matter what he believed, either way he broke his oath by not faithfully executing the Office of the Presidency.

&gt; The issue is that trump is an idiot 

He's not an idiot.  You don't get to be president by being an idiot.  He's really freaking smart at one thing - manipulating people.  He says what he needs to say in the moment to get what he wants.

Their online sites, might just show numbers to call, but reach a friendly soul and you might get a link to a local artist they know who sells one or two things in their welcome center that you can then have access to for further online exploration.

First, always use your turn signals, like all the time. Please, for the love of God 

Daytime driving lights can reduce the risk of crash by 30+% because the human eye is not accustomed to light during the day and the vehicle stands out more. Always have lights on in the rain and fog. People can see you at a distance, it gives them more reaction time.

If you are on a highway at 50+ mph, stay out of the left lane unless you are passing someone. People get real uppity about this in tn, but here's a rule that many don't realize: If the Speed Limit is 70, but you are going 80, it doesn't mean you are entitled to driving the left lane. Traffic around may be going 78, so you are going 2mph faster. There are people out there who want to go 85-90 mph. It is more your job to slow them down. A car going 5mph *faster than traffic* increases the chance for collision by around 7-10%, but a car driving 5mph *slower than traffic* increases collision chances by 30+%.

Anticipate other drivers movements. Utility vans drive slowly and have blind spots. Large F150s believe they are entitled to their place on the road and never think otherwise. Infinity and wrx drivers will drive slowly until you pass them, then they will realize that you passed them and will do anything to show you how inferior you are too them on the road by blowing by you and the next three cars until you pass them again ten minutes later while they were texting. Repeat.

Never try to pass a semi on the right unless you are positive he's not going anywhere anytime soon.

Most cops around here won't pull you over for anything under 10 over the limit. In high ticket zones, you can assume 5 over is the limit. There is a human range of error of about 3mph, so don't be so petrified of getting a ticket that you kill everyone's commute by going under the speed limit.

Hydroplaning is real shit. You don't have to be scared of it, but you need to know how to react in the rain. Take your car out to a parking lot and try hitting the brakes at different pressures in the rain. You'll be more comfortable with the gentle brake pulsing to avoid hydroplaning if you have a chance to practice first. Ice is just the same, but much more difficult to prepare for.

You will develop road rage. Don't let it color your ideas of people. Hate them *all* the same. Have patience with older cars like Lincolns, Mercury, and Buicks, many are driven by old folks just trying their best to get somewhere. I saw a study that said taking an elderly person vehicular mobility from them can accelerate the aging process and lead to dementia as connective neurons die off without use.

Fucking enjoy it man, pretty soon we'll all be sitting in self driving cars, texting, watching porn, engaging in business conferences, watching movies. Some generation will forget the freedom of your hands on the wheel, of driving without destination or purpose, of magic that happens between travelers, of the sights you can see when it's just you in the car at midnight under the Moon. Driving in our country is a privilege, very American in nature. Interstates built by the CCC, to connect every part of our huge continent. Veins and lifeblood of the country. You are a blood cell, and antibody, you carry dreams and goals with you as you drive. Don't forget the humans behind the wheel. Everyone is trying to get somewhere. One of the greatest tragedies of humanity is when a loved one leaves on a journey and doesn't make it. So take care of yourself out there.",1580060838,ffn0vn1

1653,thylocene06,"In the 2020 Democratic primaries, presidential candidates are finally competing to put forward big ideas for tackling the climate crisis.

One of the boldest comes from Bernie Sanders, who wants to spend a whopping $16 trillion of public money on a series of measures that includes a national takeover of electricity production in the United States. The plan would shut down dirty power plants and replace them with clean energy.

The plan calls for a huge expansion of a group of federal agencies that already produce and market large amounts of electricity. On the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders often cites one of them: the Tennessee Valley Authority, created during the New Deal era to bring power and economic development to one of the most benighted parts of the country.

Mr. Sanders contends his plan would eventually pay for itself through power sales to the public and other measures, like taxes on the oil companies. We‚Äôll let readers judge how likely the Congress might be to approve such a sweeping federal seizure of the power markets.

But we do want to point out that as a model for environmental cleanups, the modern T.V.A., which sells power across parts of seven states stretching from Virginia to Mississippi, leaves a great deal to be desired.

In December 2008, an immense spill of coal ash at a T.V.A. plant in Kingston, Tenn., polluted a nearby river and caused millions of dollars of property damage. The T.V.A. had failed to carry out elementary safety measures, and the lead cleanup contractor was found negligent in court. Many workers on the cleanup have fallen ill and close to 40 have died; how much responsibility the contractor bears for the deaths is still being contested in court.

The Kingston spill brought to public attention one more hazard of the fossil-fuel economy: the creation of immense, dangerous piles of filthy coal ash near power plants.

More recently, the T.V.A. has been devious and unambitious in its plans for clean energy. In an excellent new book, ‚ÄúSuperpower,‚Äù Russell Gold, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. documented the way the T.V.A. strung along a developer who wanted to build a power line bringing huge amounts of wind power into the Tennessee Valley region from Oklahoma. The T.V.A. ultimately helped kill plans for the line

That proposal for wind power transmission ought to be revived. Moreover, solar power could go a long way toward cleaning up electricity production in the South; in fact, utilities in the Carolinas, Georgia and several other states are committing to reasonably ambitious plans.

It is true that under a new chief executive, Jeff Lyash, the T.V.A. has recently made noises about building a lot of solar plants. But they seem to be just noises: The actual budget the T.V.A. has adopted calls for a more modest solar program that will most likely leave the Tennessee Valley lagging much of the South.

None of this necessarily means that Mr. Sanders is wrong in principle. The most rapid emissions cuts in advanced economies occurred in France, Canada and South Korea in the 1980s, as a result of speedy buildouts of nuclear power plants led by state-owned enterprises. Given the right mandate, a government-owned authority like the T.V.A. might well be able to move faster than private utilities in adding renewable power to the electric grid.


‚ÄúIf someone could make a compelling case that you need to put this country on a war footing to solve the climate crisis, then T.V.A. could be a tremendous asset for doing that,‚Äù said Stephen Smith, the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, an environmental advocacy group that has long battled with the T.V.A. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôd have to clean house.‚Äù

A core problem is that the T.V.A. really has no boss, other than the president, who appoints the board members to staggered terms. When Barack Obama was in the White House, he avoided pushing the T.V.A. very hard, not wanting to pick fights with Tennessee‚Äôs slightly moderate Republican senators at the time.

So the agency, long dominated by a conservative engineering mind-set, has gotten little pressure from Washington to move faster on the energy transition. But it is starting to get pressure from the other direction: cities that buy power wholesale and resell it to their citizens. Memphis, for instance, is considering pulling out of the T.V.A. system and cutting its own deals for clean power. If the T.V.A. remains so stuck in the past, we encourage other cities in the region to look hard at their options. They certainly need to resist the T.V.A.‚Äôs recent efforts to strong-arm them into signing new 20-year power contracts.

The real shame of the situation is that the T.V.A. could achieve a lot in short order, if it chose to do so. It already has some of the lowest emissions in the country. It operates seven nuclear power reactors, and is the only utility to get one built and running in this century: the new reactor at Watts Bar began operating in 2016. The T.V.A. still has the dams that it built in the 20th century, another low-emitting source of power. And to its credit, the T.V.A. board voted last year to shut down two particularly dirty coal plants, despite protests from President Trump.

Overall, the authority‚Äôs power mix is more than half clean, well above the national figure of 38 percent of all electric-power generation coming from low-carbon sources. To get to 100 percent would thus require less work at the T.V.A. than for many power suppliers. But the agency, unlike several big investor-owned utilities, has yet to announce such a goal.

The backwardness of the T.V.A. on this issue is not just a national embarrassment; it is a betrayal of the agency‚Äôs own progressive legacy as one of the signature creations of the New Deal. The next president, whether Mr. Sanders or somebody else, needs to shake up the T.V.A. board and demand that the agency become a leader, not a laggard, in battling the climate crisis.",1580138412,ffqmbxi

I had my old plates on for about 6 months and my old license, I was 16.

One, don't get caught with weed in Tennessee, two, don't get caught with old plates in Tennessee. We had both. I am absolutely mortified of Tennessee police because of the way this guy was, first he immediately told us to give him our weed because he smelled it and would search anyway. We did. Got out of the car, he made me hold my dog in my arms on the side of a busy ass highway for about 20 minutes refused to let me have his leash. He called my cousin a disgrace to the country and said he would do everything in his power to get him kicked out of the air force. Half a joint. He gave my cousin possession, me speeding, out of state lisence and registration nearly lost my license until 18 because of the points it put on it my cousin got probation. The cop didn't know how old I was and so he was talking to me as badly as he was talking to my cousin and basically treating me like a crackhead then said you people from Washington keep bringing in pot, wby are you even here?

The best and most useful in my opinion is WIC. Pregnant/postpartum/nursing mothers and children 5 &amp; under receive a set food ‚Äòpackage‚Äô monthly.

It‚Äôs usually between 50-70 worth of food a month per participant, depending on age and if the mom is breastfeeding or not. It‚Äôs income dependent, meaning that you have be at or below a specific income line vs family size.

Right now, the DNC and the democrats at large are still the party of the Clintons. They still control most of the infrastructure and thought behind it. If Sanders is to win the Dem nomination he will be able to change the structure of the party. His biggest issue will be getting through the DNC as it currently stands to win the nomination.

The problem was the GOP only did half of it - the half that cut government spending.  They ignored the follow-up which was to fund public infrastructure to support the needs of those people in the community.

&gt;  
&gt;The lawsuit, filed by Plaintiffs Damian Orlowski of Chicago and Lynn Cechin of Texas, and others similarly situated, states that Bates ""targets devout, Christian believers, elderly individuals, and widow/widowers with significant life savings, all who are seeking advice and help from a trusted Christian adviser and/or a Christian financial company...

While a bill like this would have likely been struck down by the Obama-era Supreme Court, Mitch McConnell has masterfully, strategically, nefariously turned the court decisively right. If I remember correctly, Trump has placed a quarter of Courts of Appeals judges, which has caused the country's judiciary to shift right at the regional level. All of this has the potential to allow more socially conservative legislation to be enacted into law. 

This June the Supreme Court will rule on LGBT workplace discrimination. Given the balance of the court, I find it highly unlikely to to expand LGBT civil rights, which will encourage further discriminatory laws to be trialled. I may be grasping at straws here, buy this is not the first time America, particularly the South, has seen major civil rights granted and reversed. Post-Civil War, the (male) African-American community gained unprecedented political access, only to see Jim Crow implemented by 1890. I'm not saying that this will definitely happen to the gay community. What I'm saying is that it wouldn't surprise me.

2476,WikiTextBot,"**Coal Creek War**

The Coal Creek War was an early 1890s armed labor uprising in the southeastern United States that took place primarily in Anderson County, Tennessee. This labor conflict ignited during 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed, private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system.

These former wage-earning Coal Creek coal miners repeatedly attacked and burned both state prison stockades and mine properties, all while releasing hundreds of the state convict laborers from their bondage to the mine companies. Many of these same Coal Creek coal miners were also wounded or killed in small-arms skirmishes during the Coal Creek War, along with dozens of Tennessee state militiamen.

Finally, a Samaritan happens upon the traveller.** Samaritans and Jews despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man.** Jesus is described as telling the parable in response to the question from a lawyer, ""And who is my neighbour?"". In response, Jesus tells the parable, the conclusion of which is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the man who shows mercy to the injured man‚Äîthat is, the Samaritan.

Jesus dude. This just shows how little you actually know about this stuff. Leave this to the doctors, you really need to do more research.

Being transgender isnt a mental illness, but things like dysphoria are. It's not that political pressure has forced doctors to change the definition, it's that doctors understanding of the phenomena has matured and evolved and they have broken down the illness into more specific illnesses. Dysphoria is a mental illness, but being transgender is not. The entire point of why transitioning may be considered a medical necessity is because it can be effective at treating dysphoria. All of that said, transgender individuals make up a very small portion of the population. This manufactured fear over the possibility of children being given puberty blockers is rooted in regressive social stigmas, not science or medicine. Do you actually know the process involved between a person realizing theyre trans and transitioning? I'm not saying that to be rude, I'm genuinely asking. Because it seems like a lot of people with strong opinions on this subject have done very little research themselves into it. They seem to gleam a little bit here and there, mostly from outraged social commentators who are trying to make a quick buck off of sensationalized stories and drive clicks",1581040243,fgr7s9k

BRO WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT? This is not what anyone is saying man. No one is talking about giving a 12 year old a sex change. Literally no one. You seriously need to learn the difference between puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and sex change surgeries. You should also research what patients need to do to even have access to those things, because it's definitely not the type of stuff you just walk into the doctors office and demand and then it's done.

&gt; And as I‚Äôve stated, it was last year when the medical community said that it‚Äôs not a mental disorder. That was a politically motivated decision.

What proof do you have to say it was a politically motivated decision? It was based on a matured understanding of transgenderism, and the nature of the phenomena. The DSM removed transgenderism as an illness, yes. You ignore that they added new illnesses, however. Yes, transgenderism isn't an illness, but body dysphoria is. Politics is adapting to science and medicine, not the other way around. Of course, new understandings in science and medicine may indeed challenge old understandings, traditions, or practices. That is all that is happening here. As science and medicine understands transgenderism more deeply, the specific illnesses can be more accurately diagnosed and treated. For example, trans people who take hormone blockers and transition on their own schedule, instead of being forced into arbitrary and damaging gender roles, are healthier and less likely to commit suicide. So you can see why transgenderism itself isnt the problem, but rather specific parts of what some (but not even all) trans people feel are the problems. Feeling like you're a woman isn't the illness, the illness is the obsession with looking like a woman, and the very taxing and destructive thoughts that come with NOT looking like a woman. Or a man, of course. Like, imagine how you'd feel if I forced you to dress and act like someone you dont want to be? It would feel like a prison without an end.

2630,hairygentleman,"&gt;I said societal stigma. Not social factors. One is more specific and the other, more general.

That's a misunderstand on my part, then. I'm speaking very broadly of all negative social factors facing trans people, many of which the people who virtue signal about 'lol 40%!!' are directly contributing to. 

&gt;I don‚Äôt know what it is. Maybe it‚Äôs disownment and loss/lack of a cohesive family unit after coming out.

I would very firmly classify that in the category of social factors and 'people making their lives a living hell', which is what I've been talking about from the beginning. We may have been talking past each other and don't actually disagree on much. 

&gt;Maybe it‚Äôs a co-product dysphoria itself.

I'd argue that for pre transition absolutely, but while their suicide rate does decrease post transition, it's still much higher than average. So, it's definitely a factor in the 40%, but obviously not entirely explanatory. 

&gt;I don‚Äôt know exactly what, but I don‚Äôt believe that statistic will go down if we ignore other things and take the easy route saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs those bad guys that are the problem‚Äù

It's not really 'the easy route', as changing these social factors definitely isn't easy at all. I moreso point it out because it's so odd to see people pretend to care about trans people's suicide rates while simultaneously denying medical treatment that is proven to help and contributing to social conditions that undeniably add to that suicide rate (even if not entirely explanatory). 

&gt;Yeah, stupid people saying disparaging things and committing despicable acts are a problem, but they aren‚Äôt a particularly unique problem to our time or place. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt believe they are the unique cause.

I think my argument would basically boil down to 'if we lived in a very progressive society that was completely accepting and supportive of trans people and they were treated completely normally, their suicide rate would probably be similar to the average'.

I start out by saying that children don't choose to transition, just like they don't choose to be prescribed medication for any other medical condition. 

You then say that we don't give treatment to non existent problems, which is pretty clearly implying that you don't believe gender dysphoria to exist or be a problem. 

I reply by bringing that up and asking you to clarify. 

And then we get to the dreaded morphine comment. The only interpreation of this that is reasonable is you pointing out incorrect diagnosis for a condition is bad. Obviously. The fact that you used morphine and pain as examples and specified that this doesn't mean that pain doesn't exist heavily implies that you believe gender dysphoria to exist and transition to be its treatment, although you may be skeptical about its diagnosis sometimes. 

Nothing that I have ever said disagrees with that interpretation. People should be accurately diagnosed by a professional before medically transitioning. We don't use occasional incorrect diagnosis to never prescribe a treatment, which is what I pointed out in my next reply. You then become dumbfounded by my miniscule, molten, dripping, smooth brain and simply repeat your comment multiple times, even though it doesn't seem to disagree with anything I've said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Unfortunately, many rural hospitals across the country are having a difficult time and facing the same challenges, like declining reimbursements and lower patient volumes, that Cumberland River Hospital has experienced,"" CEO Paul Korth said in a written statement.

[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/07/703932131/economic-ripples-hospital-closure-hurts-a-towns-ability-to-attract-retirees](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/07/703932131/economic-ripples-hospital-closure-hurts-a-towns-ability-to-attract-retirees)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Most healthcare experts agree that the number one reason for so many closures is the state‚Äôs failure to expand Medicaid. According to the Tennessee Justice Center, every day Tennessee loses $3.8 million dollars in federal health care funding. The lack of Medicaid expansion has left more than 300,000 residents without insurance.

2712,ROSSA_2020,"&gt; That said, allowing a child to decide whether or not to actually take hormone therapy to transition would be wrong, the way I see it.

But literally no one is advocating for that. Children wouldnt take hormone therapy, they'd take puberty blockers, specifically until they're legally old enough to consent to taking hormones. Per wikipedia:

&gt; The formal requirements for hormone replacement therapy vary widely.

&gt; Historically, many health centers required a psychiatric evaluation and/or a letter from a therapist before beginning therapy. **Many centers now use an informed consent model that does not require any routine formal psychiatric evaluation but instead focuses on reducing barriers to care by ensuring a person can understand the risks, benefits, alternatives, unknowns, limitations, and risks of no treatment.**[2] Some LGBT health organizations (notably Chicago's Howard Brown Health Center[3] and Planned Parenthood[4]) advocate for this type of informed consent model.

&gt; **The Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (SOC) require that the patient be referred by a mental health professional who has diagnosed the patient with persistent gender dysphoria. The Standards also require that the patient give informed consent, in other words, that they consent to the treatment after being fully informed of the risks involved.[5]**

&gt; The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care, 7th edition, note that both of these approaches to care are appropriate.[6] 

So as you can see here, if a patient is not legally old enough to give consent, they cannot receive hormones. In light of this information, it should become more clear that there is an entire industry based around fanning the flames of fear and disinformation around transgenderism, and specifically transgenderism in childhood. This is because transphobes want to create a narrative around trans people coming for your children, and tricking them into being trans. The reality is children cannot get a sex change surgery, does not have access to hormones, and if they're prebuscent, doesn't even access to puberty blockers. When we see the world ""child"" used in this context, that is, someone under the age of puberty, we're literally talking about kids wearing dresses and shit. So thats why when people say ""kids shouldnt be getting sex changes!"" it just comes off as absurd, because everyone, including the trans community and medical community studying transgenderism, agrees with that, and its why thats not happening, at least not legally or ethically or widely.",1581094225,fgswp8p

Knoxville and Chattanooga are small cities. Chattanooga is definitely outdoorsy, and I love the people and culture there. Not sure what the healthcare industry is like.

Knoxville has a humongous healthcare industry, 3 main hospital chains including the university. Tons of stuff to do outdoors, and the Smoky Mountains are an hour away.

I'm a small-town girl, though, and honestly Knoxville is too big for my taste. I highly recommend Cookeville. There's enough to do that it isn't boring, but it doesn't take 20 minutes to get anywhere. It's surrounded by many state parks and beautiful areas. Check out Burgess Falls, Cummins Falls, and Fall Creek Falls. There's one hospital in town, but it is in no danger of closing. There are also several SNIFs/rehab centers you could look at. Also, cost of living there is insanely low. Like 3BR house for $800/mo. Also, great schools.

That said, store policies may differ and require that the individuals accompanying the purchaser be ID‚Äôd as well.

There‚Äôs a restaurant in my city that requires the wait staff to have a manager examine the ID of anyone who has a red box around the photo on their ID, regardless of their age. This is the red box that‚Äôs placed around the photo of anyone who‚Äôs ID is issued prior to their 21st birthday and clearly states the date at which the person will be eligible to purchase alcoholic beverages. Of course, if you grew up in Tennessee, then your ID likely expires **on** your 21st birthday, which means you‚Äôll have to renew it prior to your 21st and will be stuck with that red box for a number of years.

An **accidental death** is an [unnatural death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnatural_death) that is caused by an [accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident) such as a [slip and fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_and_fall), [traffic collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision), or accidental [poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning). Accidental deaths are distinguished from [death by natural causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_natural_causes) ([disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease)) and from intentional [homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide) and [suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide). An accidental death can still be considered a homicide or suicide if a person was the unintentional cause.

For criminal purposes, intentional homicides are usually classified as [murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder). Exceptions such as [self-defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense) vary by jurisdiction, and some cases, persons accused of murder have asserted as a defense that the deceased was actually the victim of an accidental death rather than an intentional act. However, a person who is responsible for the accidental death of another through [negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence) may still be criminally liable for [manslaughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter), and civilly liable for [wrongful death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death). [Accidental death and dismemberment insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_death_and_dismemberment_insurance) and similar insurance policies pay a benefit in the event of an accidental death,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_death#cite_note-1) With these policies it must be demonstrated that a given death is in fact an accident, rather than an intentional suicide or homicide (which might also involve [insurance fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_fraud)).

It has been suggested that ""vast majority of accidents are not really accidents of chance but rather accidents of folly, negligence, and blatant human misjudgment"".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_death#cite_note-2) The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) reports that in the US in 2015, there were 146,571 ""unintentional injury deaths"" that year, the fourth leading cause of death. Of those, 47,478 were from unintentional poisoning, 37,757 were from traffic accidents, and 33,381 were from falls.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_death#cite_note-3)

To calculate this, you **divide** the total number of crimes **by** the total population and then **multiply** that result by 100,000. So, for example, if you wanted to know what the per capita violent crime rate was in 2014 you‚Äôd divide 39,848 by 6,549,352 which equals 0.0060842. Multiply that by 100,000 and you get 608.42. So, the population adjusted crime rate is 608.42 per 100,000. The crime rate in 2000 was 707.17 per 100,000. So, TN‚Äôs crime rate actually went down 98 points in the period between 2000 and 2014!

3217,Aspirin_Dispenser,"&gt;They can still get credentials. This is removing the requirement.

That‚Äôs correct. 

But here‚Äôs the problem. Licensing regulations exist for a reason. They allow the governing body to establish minimum educational and training requirements for people who wish to practice a given profession. Want to practice as an architect? You have to have a degree. They also allow the governing body to require that licensees participate in continuing education programs, thereby ensuring that licensees remain up to date with best practices. And finally, it provides the governing body with an avenue to peruse action against individuals that are practicing their profession in a manner that is inappropriate or detrimental to the public. So, if you‚Äôre an architect that is designing structurally unstable structures, the board can strip your license and prevent you from practicing. And if you continue to practice, the board can pursue legal action against you. 

If you deregulate a profession, like architecture, then you open a door that allows quite literally anyone to advertise themselves as an architect and enter into a business relationship providing architectural services despite having no formal training in the field. Then, the self-described architect designs an unstable building that gets built, collapses, and kills or seriously injures people. And here‚Äôs the kicker: **since he slid a clause somewhere in the middle of his 50 page employment contract, the only remedy available to his victims is to peruse him through years of costly litigation**. And the architect get to continue practicing, putting even more people at risk. 

There are some professions in this list, like barbers, who don‚Äôt need to be licensed because malpractice within their profession doesn‚Äôt represent a significant risk to the public. However, there are others on the list, like architecture, who absolutely do a need to be licensed and regulated. Suggesting that they not be is inane.",1581712296,fhmg3m7

3273,RegisteredToUnsub,"Copying and pasting my explanation from another sub:

She's saying it was a Caption Bill, which is something unique to state legislatures. 

In Tennessee, we have a part-time legislature. As a result, the General Assembly has a bill-filing deadline each year to make sure the session doesn't drag on. No new bills can be filed, but bills can be completely rewritten through amendments.

Tennessee also has a requirement that bills have a caption stating the topic, and they can't include anything outside the caption. This prevents the omnibus bills you see in DC. 

For example, here's the caption on a random recent bill: ""AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 55-8-185, relative to operation of off-highway vehicles on certain highways."" This caption is very specific and any amendment would have to still deal with that same TCA section. But the captions can be very generic. 

When you combine the two things, you get a workaround called a caption bill. Legislators will introduce bullshit bills that have generic captions before the bill-filing deadline. The bills just sit there, because they never intend to enact that language. Then, if something comes up or someone has a late idea, they can amend the bill to delete all the language after the caption and basically push the ""new"" bill from there even though it was after the filing deadline.

This caption was ""AN ACT to amend  Tennessee Code  Annotated, Title 62 and  Title 63, relative to professional licenses."" So it has a very generic caption. It can be amended later to relate to anything about professional licenses within two Titles of the TCA (titles are the biggest divisions of the TCA).

Looking at the bill history, it was introduced, but there was no action taken on it since its introduction back in January. This was likely intended, like she said, as a caption bill and a reporter found it and made it a controversy.

However, that works both ways. Let‚Äôs say you want to develop a commercial space from scratch. You have a solid financial backing and a large pool of investors so of course you are going to hire someone who is licensed in every type of way to do your sight plan, engineering, architecture etc. 

Now let‚Äôs say you just got hired to work at the new amazon factory in Memphis. You grew up poor and  this job pays way better than any job you‚Äôve ever had. You see that the land bank is selling a large lot for $1,000 in an impoverished area. That doesn‚Äôt mean shit to you obviously, so you buy it and want to hire someone to engineer and architect the home. Well guess what, the dudes with all the licenses are super expensive in comparison to some shady guy who started an engineering LLC as a result of this law passing. You sign all the paperwork giving away your rights to sue for a shitty job because you just aren‚Äôt educated on how land development is supposed to work. Then guess what, the guy engineers a structurally house that collapses in during a thunderstorm and destroyed all your personal belongings. Guess what? You‚Äôre fucked and there is nothing you can do about it

This law would have no effect on companies that do large scale developments or even smaller scale local companies.

The three regions are in many ways culturally homogenous, despite that we always like to pick on poor West Tennessee. Pockets of isolated or local culture in the hills and hollers of East and Middle Tennessee hint to a time when Scottish and Irish were hoping to escape harsh British rule. They settled this part of the country because it reminded them of the highlands of their home. They brought with them a sense of Independence, whiskey, and disdain for government. These values are still strong regionally.  
  
The physiography of the three regions varies dramatically. From East to West, East Tennessee begins at the Blue Ridge Mountains, an ancient mountain complex that was once taller than Everest. Time has brought it low and rounded it out, but it is still spectacular. Going west from there you'll cross the Valley and Ridge province. It's a series of anticlines and sinclines following a general south by south-west and north by north-east structure. Knoxville and Chattanooga are both located in this province. East Tennessee ends right at Waldens Ridge, the Eastern escarpment to the Cumberland Plateau. The Plateau is a raised sandstone capped mesa with rolling hills and water problems. The canyons flanking the east side of the plateau are home to some of the most biologically diverse rivers in the world. For now at least.  
  
Middle Tennessee begins as the Plateau, descends to the Eastern Highland Rim, which is rife with waterfalls and caves. Cookeville is located on the Eastern Highland Rim. Continuing west you continue to drop to the Nashville Basin. Surprise, Nashville sits inside the Nashville Basin. Further west is the Western Highland Rim, which is like the Eastern one but not as dramatic. Clarksville is located on the Western Highland Rim.
  
West Tennessee begins at the Tennessee River (generally*) and gives way to a flatter landscape called the Coastal Plain. Memphis is located in this physiographic province.

I agree with most I read but here is thing folks are missing with this part of the state: the people are stubborn as fuck.

Folks do focus on family and home a lot which can be nice. Church is a big deal but if you're a bigger city (well at least Knoxville) it's not weird to be non-religious. Definitely the best for just natural beauty and several other metro areas and a day's drive.

Middle TN: The people here are a mixed bag. You will find many different cultural and spiritual beliefs. However, the farther out from Nashville you get the less diverse it becomes. For the most part you will find the people to be open and welcoming no matter who you are. Some areas can be a little stand off ish. But if you‚Äôre thinking about Middle TN don‚Äôt only look at Nashville. There are plenty of other metropolitan areas, rural towns, and mixtures of both. Whatever it is that you want. The line between rural and cities are blurred here. In general you will find more people, more work, and more expense. No matter where you live you will have reasonable access to whatever you want.

East TN: You will find the people here to be less diverse even in Knoxville. It‚Äôs is important to remember that East TN is Appalachia, and they are proud of that. You won‚Äôt receive as warm of a welcome, but it won‚Äôt be bad either. The people here are just slower to warm up to you, but with time it will be wonderful. The line here between rural and cities are a lot more firm. When leaving metropolitan areas, they will abruptly end and you will be in the country. However, some places like Chattanooga are an exception to that rule. In general you will find less people, less jobs (in certain areas), and less expense. Rural areas here are more remote and you will have less access to anything you may want without an hour plus drive.

I‚Äôm surprised that Clarksville is mentioned in the thorough geographers diagnosis, but Murfreesboro would be a better sub city to Nashville to analyze and explain the culture of the section. Murfreesboro is extremely diverse, similar to Nashville, but it has a faster access to rural areas through 840. Honestly, in middle Tennessee, you can go from extremely urban environments to extremely rural environments in the course of 20 minutes (traffic dependent). The area, geographically, is majority rural. A lot of farming is oriented south of Nashville, outside of the city life of areas like Murfreesboro, Brentwood, Franklin, and Spring Hill. 

Middle Tennessee‚Äôs story is best described by its means of travel: I-65. The big cities are conducted by it, and the little cities thrive off of it. Within middle Tennessee, you‚Äôre given pretty much any opportunity to live the ‚Äúsouthern American dream‚Äù. That‚Äôs been discovered by the influx of transplants, who affect the larger areas more than the more rural, and continues to have such persons.

Knoxville has the Smoky Mountains close which are beautiful year round if you like hiking and outdoor activities. The cost of living is good there. The major drawback to East TN is there‚Äôs not a major airport or things like pro sports, big concerts, and Broadway plays. Same is true for Chattanooga. 

Nashville has pro sports, a busy airport, concerts, tons to do, but the cost of living has skyrocketed in the last ten years. To find land in the country that‚Äôs affordable you‚Äôre going to have to venture way out. Maybe Cannon or Coffee county would have what you want, but they‚Äôre 90 minutes from the city. There‚Äôs also beautiful state parks in Middle TN near Cookeville. 

Memphis has a major airport thanks to Fedex, a pro NBA team, big concerts, Broadway plays, and pretty parks within an hour or so. Lakeland or Arlington have nice large lots, and you‚Äôre only about 30-45 minutes from the city. Don‚Äôt let the crime stats scare you. It‚Äôs very concentrated areas that have bad crime. People love to hate on Memphis for some reason. The cost of living here is so cheap compared to anywhere else I‚Äôve ever lived. My house would be 2 to 2.5 times as much in Nashville as it is here.

3534,StarDatAssinum,"I moved from the North East (NJ/NY specifically) to Nashville 3+ years ago, and here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve noticed:

- NJ/NY companies, while not always, tend to be very ‚Äúlive to work‚Äù where a lot of places will not value a healthy balance between work-life balance. Nashville companies, from what I‚Äôve experienced, have been very much the opposite with a ‚Äúwork to live‚Äù mentality. Nashville companies I‚Äôve found have been very supportive of this notion with more work from home options, taking account of weather (aka ‚Äúsnow‚Äù lol), and just a general more care of personal life in the work culture. It may not be the case for every company, but the ones that‚Äôs I‚Äôve worked for

- Nashville is full of transplants and a lot of people not from the area, but many of the companies like to foster ‚ÄúSouthern hospitality‚Äù in the work place, which is why in your example all the men stood and waited for the woman to sit first. It‚Äôs similar to letting the woman in/out of the room or elevator first, holding a door open for a woman, etc. Going past the gender thing, your co-workers in Nashville are much more involved with talking about their/your lives. Generally ‚Äúmore polite‚Äù than coworkers in NY/NJ that just get through the day, and maybe talk to your friends, but might not go out of your way to talk to co-workers you don‚Äôt interact with. 

- I work in the downtown area so this may vary depending on where you work in Nashville, but people are REALLY big on Happy Hours. I‚Äôd go to a few throughout the month in NY/NJ, but people go every damn day here sometimes. It‚Äôs nuts IMO lol

Again, this is what I‚Äôve personally noticed in my work (banking) in Nashville vs. my work in NJ or NY, it may differ to others. Feel free to ask me any more questions!",1582171173,fi5uyve

I completed this form in November and it was sent off to State Rep John Ragan-  he responded the very next day with this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dear Opening-Replacement,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for contacting me on the subject of cannabis (marijuana) legalization. Unfortunately, in your email, you failed to state adequate justification for your position for legalization as a ""cannabis voter.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, I must assume that you have none except what has been in the popular press¬† Consequently, for reasons outlined in the attached Word document, I cannot support             your implied request for legalization. Nonetheless, I do appreciate your inquiry on this issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please continue to stay involved with your government. ?  
&gt;  
&gt;Regards,  
&gt;  
&gt;John D. Ragan

&amp;#x200B;

I then responded (quite a bit later, though, in January 2020) with this:

&gt;Mr. Ragan,  
&gt;  
&gt;¬† ¬†¬† I am one of your constituents, and first/foremost, I asked you a question regarding your position on legalization.  
&gt;  
&gt;¬†¬†¬†¬† I didn't realize I had to approach you initially with an argument to defend my position.¬† I felt it was sufficient and ultimately more time efficient to just say, hey,         I'm a constituent and this is what I think.¬† Since you incorrectly assumed that I did not have adequate justification for my position, and didn't ask for one (why?), I'm inclined to share my argument:¬† I feel the legalization of recreational cannabis to be based purely on civil rights. Cannabis is widely known to be one of the *safest*, *most therapeutic* substances ***known to man\****.¬† In my opinion, there really isn't any justifiable reason to impose on this innate and inalienable right.¬† Cannabis use is rising, and it's         for good, sound reason- and I say inalienable right because people are going to use it (with no effect!) regardless of its legal status.¬† Because of this simple fact, black markets control the movement of illegal marijuana, paving the way for gangs, cartels and criminals to take advantage of ordinary, otherwise law-abiding, good people.¬† Beyond the black market, the persecution of non-violent cannabis law offenders undermines the good intentions of law enforcement, severely impacting public/police relations among a vast demographic. Its legalization benefits extend to the state with the potential for 8-figure tax revenue, the economy by potentially adding thousands of jobs and increased public spending, and the public with lower rates of DUI and an alternative to alcohol and opioids.¬† A growing number of states and countries ***ARE             LISTENING TO THEIR RESIDENTS***, and reaping the benefits of providing regulation for safe and legal access to cannabis-¬† I think Tennessee should join those states.¬† ***It's               time, sir.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reading.¬†

That's not even a conspiracy theory, the guy personally responsible &amp;mdash; Nixon's chief of domestic policy &amp;mdash; straight-up [confessed that he did it:](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/03/23/nixons-drug-war-an-excuse-to-lock-up-blacks-and-protesters-continues/)


&gt; The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I‚Äôm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

Few, if any, GOP politicians are going to reverse course on marijuana because now, more than ever, the GOP's grip on power requires the suppression of black voters.  They don't care if some white people are collateral damage either, there are plenty of other white people who can make up the difference.  The only red state that has legalized is Alaska, and they did at the ballot without the politicians.

   My personal favorites for an easy afternoon with maximum reward are Rainbow Lake on Signal Mountain, and Cloudland Canyon on the other side of Lookout. 
   Both are beautiful drives. Rainbow is usually really quiet spot that‚Äôs easy to chill at for the afternoon - Cloudland is a more intense hike the further you go, but the view is the best you can get in East TN in my opinion. 

Food-wise, I have to agree that nothing is super spectacular, but there are some good spots to check out here. 
   Blue Plate and Kenny‚Äôs are both probably the best breakfast/brunch/lunch.
   Champy‚Äôs is amazing for some good fried chicken. Not the most amazing for spicy, but super savory, especially with their sauce and fries.
   A little bit out of town, but Fat Boy‚Äôs Roadside Eats is awesome for BBQ styles.

Other fun things to do:
   Check out the Aquarium, for sure. Everybody says it for a reason. 
   Rock City has gotten a lot more crowded in recent years, and, while it‚Äôs still a cool spot, you‚Äôre likely to encounter a big crowd. Riding the Incline Railway up and walking over to Point Park is more low-key, with an equally pretty view, and the upper station has a great fudge shop inside.
   Chattanooga Whiskey Experimental Distillery is a cool place to take a tour. Only $12 for adults including full tour and tasting and kids get in for free - just go after 4:00 or on a weekend to get the full version when production has stopped for the day! The hot chocolatier next door gives discounts to Chatt Whiskey customers, so that‚Äôs a good cheap treat, too. 
   The Chattanooga Choo Choo is awesome nowadays. I‚Äôve always enjoyed going for a nice walk in the garden, and recently they‚Äôve added all kinds of coffee shops/restaurants/taprooms that are attached. There‚Äôs even a really cool arcade and a spectacular guitar museum, too!

3852,chucksutherland,"Water is scarce on the Plateau so agriculture isn't as common as other rural areas of the state. Coal and timber are the major resources and coal's time in Tennessee is long past. Many communities on the Plateau began as coal mining camps. Sand is being mined in places on the plateau now, and flagstone is growing in popularity.  
  
While the Plateau has gentle rolling hills, its margins are rugged and sometimes have multiple tall cliff lines. In the southern part of the state the Plateau gets steeper, but in the north it gets wider with more and more breaks from cliffs. This makes transportation a big issue regionally. For example, between two of our larger Plateau cities in the Upper Cumberland, Highway 127 is two lanes most of the way.

The combination of lack of resources and challenging transportation contribute to the region's inability to grow at the same place as places like Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville, and Memphis. Those cities were are founded early and still are considered river cities. 

If you look at the progression of cities in the USA, it began at the port cities, which are now the largest cities in the USA. Next, they traveled up the rivers and founded river cities, the next largest class now by population. Rail was the next major driver in city development. The Cumberland Plateau was primarily founded during this time. But many of the smaller rail cities actually shrank after the dawn of the automobile. I suspect that is the case for much of the Plateau.",1582607536,fipi0cz

Here we know that the phrase has a military sense, and no other; and we must infer that it is used in the same sense in the 26th section, which secures to the citizen the right to bear arms. A man in the pursuit of deer, elk and buffaloes, might carry his rifle every day, for forty years, and, yet, it would never be said of him, that he had borne arms, much less could it be said, that a private citizen bears arms, because he has a dirk or pistol concealed under his clothes, or a spear in a cane.",1582817456,fixc7x1

Scalia covered all of this very well in *District of Columbia v. Heller*, 554 U.S. 570 (2008).

Here a snippet:

&gt; Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment , nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.

I disagree with your argument that the ""right to bear arms"" is language of military context and has been redefined in the last 50 years.  This is a quote from Heller: 

""Between 1789 and 1820, nine States adopted Second Amendment analogues. Four of them‚ÄîKentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri‚Äîreferred to the right of the people to ‚Äúbear arms in defence of themselves and the State.‚Äù See n. 8, supra. Another three States‚ÄîMississippi, Connecticut, and Alabama‚Äîused the even more individualistic phrasing that each citizen has the ‚Äúright to bear arms in defence of himself and the State.‚Äù See ibid. Finally, two States‚ÄîTennessee and Maine‚Äîused the ‚Äúcommon defence‚Äù language...""

4085,JimWilliams423,"Scalia was certainly at the vanguard of that redefintion.  He was a clever bastard, that's for sure.  In that quote from his Heller opinion you can see how he reframes words that contradict his argument to make it seem the opposite.  For example, the phrase ""the common defense"" is quite obviously a military reference.   The US constitution specifically says ""the common defense"" in [Article 1, Section 8](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s8) when referring to keeping a navy, supporting armies, repelling invasions, suppressing insurrections, etc.  But Scalia cites its use as if it somehow had a non-military connotation.   We already know what the TN supreme court thought their own constitution meant, but Scalia's claiming the opposite.

The other cites he makes are even more slippery - they all explicitly call out ""defense of self"" precisely because the common definition of ""bear arms"" did not include defense of self.  The authors of those state constitutions knew they had to add ""defense of self"" because it was not implied.  And yet Scalia claims the reverse - because they explicitly extended the context to include defense of self, that must somehow mean it was implicit in the phrase ""bear arms."" 

&gt;I don't think it's fair to say everyone was on the same page back in the day and only recently did that definition begin to change.

Books, articles and even private letters from that time period have been [digitized and are now searchable.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/antonin-scalia-was-wrong-about-the-meaning-of-bear-arms/2018/05/21/9243ac66-5d11-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html)  Searching for ""bear arms"" in those writings finds well over a thousand military uses and barely a few non-miltary:

&gt; A search of Brigham Young University‚Äôs new online Corpus of Founding Era American English, with more than 95,000 texts and 138 million words, yields 281 instances of the phrase ‚Äúbear arms.‚Äù BYU‚Äôs Corpus of Early Modern English, with 40,000 texts and close to 1.3 billion words, shows 1,572 instances of the phrase. Subtracting about 350 duplicate matches, that leaves about 1,500 separate occurrences of ‚Äúbear arms‚Äù in the 17th and 18th centuries, and only a handful don‚Äôt refer to war, soldiering or organized, armed action. These databases confirm that the natural meaning of ‚Äúbear arms‚Äù in the framers‚Äô day was military.

Predicating a definition based on a tiny minority of non-standard usage isn't intellectually honest.  In any large group, there will always be outliers, but they don't define the group.  In a democracy the opinion of 1% should not outweigh the opinion of 99%.",1582833006,fiy5nrh

Who's right is it to the books, the people or the library?  It's pretty clear that the 2nd amendment has absolutely nothing to do with military context and does IN FACT guarantee the right to bear arms for civilian purposes. It's an intellectually dull argument to say that the 2nd amendment does not encompass this, as the military has absolutely no need for this amendment, they're the military.

It only exists to discourage people who can't get the time off to sit in the DMV for four hours or can't afford the cost of the class and the tax.

TN has absolutely no say in what the federal definition of the 2nd amendment is and has no say in how that affects them. TN is part of a union that legally has to abide by that union's rules.

4142,NAP51DMustang,"&gt; I'm all for protecting the right of Americans to carry weapons, but in this era, you have to have some sort of registration and training program.

No you don't, 15 other states already have permitless carry and saw no noticeable change in statistics.  
  
&gt; Many of the accidental weapon deaths that occur are due to blind ignorance.   
  
A CCW license has no effect on this as you don't need a CCW to own a firearm in TN, just be 18 and pass a NICS check.   
  
&gt;  You can't simply give anyone the ability to escalate a situation from a minor inconvenience to a life-or-death decision.  
  
Again 15 other states already have permitless carry with no noticeable change in statistics.  
  
&gt;  In addition, you would seriously increase the risks involved in officer interventions. A law enforcement officer is able to locate registration and permit records to determine if someone is likely to be armed when pulling someone over or performing a welfare check.  
  
Tennessee doesn't have a weapons registry nor does the federal government so I'd love to know what registry they are looking up you are mentioning. Also no permit is needed to own a weapon only carry in public.  
  
&gt; With this new permitless-system, officers would simply have to assume that everyone is constantly armed.  
  
They already do.  
  
&gt;  That would make an already remarkably controversial and dangerous confrontation even more risky for both the officer and the citizen. Overall, this is a terrible move that does nothing to actually protect our citizens and our state.  
  
Again 15 other states have permitless carry and no noticeable change in any statistic with guns.  
   
Since it seems like you don't know what it takes to own a gun in TN let me enlighten you. It takes 3 things:  
  
1) Be 18 (or 21 for pistol)  
2) Pass a NICS check (federal background check)  
3) Cash

Let me spell it out for you, take a deep breath here, and read carefully.

1. People without any gun safety training are more likely to use guns unsafely.

2. People who use guns unsafely might accidentally shoot themselves or others. 

3. Currently if you want to carry your gun in public in the state you need to get a permit.

4. That permit requires rudimentary safety training and a shooting test.

5. This means a number of people who buy guns, will get that test, because they want to concealed carry.

6. Waving the test means less people will get that training, because they can now carry legally without it.

7. This means the chances of people accidentally using guns unsafely because of ignorance or irresponsibility is greater.

I'm fine with them waving the cost if they want but if you don't have 4 hours to sit through the most rudimentary possible training you have no business carrying.

And ideally they would do licensing the other way and require everyone to take safety training before purchasing a firearm. Most gun owners are responsible and don't need it but Tennessee has it's fair share of idiots that buy guns because they want to feel tough or cool, and those are the people that typically end up accidentally shooting themselves or someone else, or letting their kids get a hold of them and cause an accidental discharge.

I'm a 24 year old, able bodied male. I am in the militia. 


https://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm

&gt;The phrase ""well-regulated"" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected.

4166,TN_SoundsGoodToMe,"You have to get a CCW license to carry in this state legally, open or concealed. It's a very basic written test and shooting competency test. I think mine took a few hours and it was basically just a few videos and statistics, and then you had to show the instructor you knew how to operate your firearm, and hit the broadside of a barn with it. 

So yes, it's legal, but only if you get the license. Otherwise you are restricted to keeping guns in your home or vehicle. Also localities have their own regulations about open carry, so just because it's legal in the state doesn't mean you can do it anywhere, and some businesses will kick you out if you open carry. Pretty much no one cares if you concealed carry anywhere as long as you have the CCW and you aren't doing it somewhere dumb like a post office or something. 

What the state is proposing is changing the CCW to be an online test that would take about 90 minutes, and no in-person written or shooting test. It would also lower the fee to get the license. I think this is a bad idea because some training is better than none, though I don't mind if they drop the fee.",1582859022,fizbz5m

Some suggestions for various places:  
In Chattanooga, you might want to visit Ruby Falls. Definitely go to the aquarium. There's also a couple good brewpubs around, as in Knoxville.  
In the Smokies, I'd say you should allocate *at least* a full day if not more - start at the Sugarlands Visitor Center, you should be able to find out what trails you want to do from there. Consider Clingman's Dome, but be warned that it is a fairly strenuous walk up from the parking area to the observation tower - it's paved, but it's also at nearly a 13% gradient (elevation gain of over 300 feet over half a mile), and the air is (to me) noticeably thinner (quick check says it's around 80% of normal pressure at sea level). I wouldn't bother with Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg has some neat bits but is mostly tourist trap (though not as bad as PF).  
On your way between Chattanooga and Knoxville/the Smokies, there's the world's second largest non-subglacial underground lake called The Lost Sea. There's *boat tours* on it.

But the actual reason is that it's straight up impossible for it to be any other way. There's two factors at play here;

1) It's a positive right. Someone is being compelled to provide something for someone else. In this case the state, acting on behalf of the people, is being compelled to provide a space for the march/protest.

2) The thing to be provided is finite. There simply is not enough space for everyone to march or protest whenever they feel like it. And everyone has an equal right to these spaces.

The right to bear arms has essentially nothing in common with any of that. It's a negative right. The only thing it compels is inaction on the part of the state. And a person carrying a gun does not deplete any finite thing that collectively belongs to the community.

4235,Political_Analyst,"While you are technically correct, you‚Äôre wrong in certain significant aspects. 

States censor information from their populations for obvious select reasons. The most important of which is control, as the state must have monopoly on the use of force within its sovereignty. Tying into this is security, which can be undermined if the public becomes anxious, as chaos may break out and the state‚Äôs monopoly of force is weakened. This can sometimes lead to regime change if the formula for revolution is correct. 

What you need to look at comparatively with the United States and China is the *type* of information being censored. China already vigorously censors the information released to its populous, due to it being an authoritarian state. The United States censors only Information that is deemed classified, sensitive to national defense and security, by various espionage laws passed since World War I, like the Espionage Act of 1917 and Atomic Energy Act of 1954. You also have to look at the degree of transparency between our governments, where the United States has FOIA Requests and China does not allow unfriendly inquiry into its administration. Right now, there is no evidence that the HHS and Trump Administration are censoring information on case numbers. In fact, they are releasing information that there is not enough medical equipment in the United States to deal with a pandemic like Coronavirus. This has prompted public outrage, and the Administration is invoking Special Powers to broadly increase production of this equipment. 

What I was alluding to is public officials in a state keeping cool heads amidst chaos. Those are the current affairs of things in the United States. The President does not want the markets to fall, as they have been, and will try to calm the public as best he can.

In Prentice Cooper State Forest, near Chattanooga, there's a spot called Snooper's Rock that overlooks the Tennessee River gorge as the river flows through the eastern side of the Cumberland Plateau.

Fall Creek Falls State Park, about an hour south of Cookeville (which itself is about halfway between Nashville and Knoxville on I40), has some gorgeous waterfalls (hence the name). There's also some nice falls around Cookeville itself (notably Cummins and Burgess, both of which are also state parks).

A little further south of Cookeville you have Savage Gulf State Natural Area, which has waterfalls (are you sensing a theme here?) and overlooks (also a big theme in the area around the Plateau), plus an interesting feature called the Great Stone Door, a crack with stairs (at least semi-natural - it was used by the Cherokee) in the escarpment leading into the gorge below.

Appalachian English is a variant of American English native to the Appalachian mountain region of the Eastern United States. Historically, the term ""Appalachian dialect"" refers to a local English variety of southern Appalachia, also known as Smoky Mountain English or Southern Mountain English in the United States, both influential upon and influenced by the  Southern U.S. regional dialect, which has become predominant in central and southern Appalachia today, while a Western Pennsylvania regional dialect has become predominant in northern Appalachia. The 2006 Atlas of North American English identifies the ""Inland South,‚Äù a dialect sub-region in which the Southern U.S. dialect's defining vowel shift is the most developed, as centering squarely in southern Appalachia: namely, the cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; and Asheville, North Carolina. All Appalachian English is rhotic and characterized by distinct phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon.

3) Outside of the above you are also completely ignoring logistics of ordering food in a repeatable and predictable manner with no set menu. This in turn means your ""eating spots"" will be out of food for days at a time.   
  
To expound upon 2 above; restaurants don't exist to ensure some food type is specifically served but to meet the demand that the food they do serve is, well, served. With your ""eating soots"" you create a situation where people who don't want what is being served have no where to go.

You'll have to have a fishing license. A lot of the rivers/streams in the national park are stocked and you can fish from the bridges right in the middle of Gatlinburg.*

Some good day trails for walking/hiking in the area. *Way too many to count. You'll be pretty close to the Great Smoky Mtns National Park.

You will have people coming by in the coming days to say they can help you, and maybe they can, but it‚Äôs imperative that you wait for your carrier to make an offer on the scope of the loss before you hire someone to fight for you. Paying someone ANY money on monies that you were going to get anyway doesn‚Äôt make sense in the slightest, but people make rash decisions when their lives have been thrown into upheaval. 

File your claim. Get all communication with your carrier in writing. Wait for their offer. Get their estimate reviewed (for free if possible). Then make the decision to hire help. Not before then. 

With that said I know everyone likes to think their adjuster, and their carrier, is their friend (nationwide is on your side, like a good neighbor State Farm is there, all state you‚Äôre in good hands, etc), but it‚Äôs not your adjusters job to maximize your claim. It‚Äôs their job to manage it. 

Make no mistake. This is going to be a large loss for all insurance carriers, and they will do what they can to minimize their losses. Even if it‚Äôs at the expense of those who have suffered. 

Below I will have included a step by step guide on what to do after a catastrophe. 

Stay safe everyone, 

Your local insurance specialist 



No one ever expects a fire or tornado destroy their home or building. Those kinds of things happen to other people. Being the victim of a catastrophic loss doesn‚Äôt mean you have to allow yourself to become a victim a second time by relinquishing the control of your claim to others and, as a result, having a less than favorable outcome. Following are some tips and suggestions that will help you ADAPT and stay in command of your claim so that you set yourself up to maximize your settlement. So when the unexpected does happen to you, and hundreds of thousands of dollars are hanging in the balance, just ADAPT.

**Adjuster**

Put any request for information or answers in writing to the adjuster. It will send them a very obvious message that you are taking this claim seriously and it will force them to respond in kind. What is in writing carries infinitely more weight than what is spoken.
Your first request ought to be to ask your adjuster in writing to provide you a complete copy of your policy with all forms and endorsements. The policy is the instruction manual for the claim. You will need an up-to-date copy. It is free. Again ‚Äì ask for it in writing.
Your adjuster is going to keep a written log of all activity associated with your claim (including conversations with you). It would be prudent for you to do likewise. Don‚Äôt let the insurance company be the only one documenting the claim.

While you wait for the certified policy, ask your insurance adjuster or agent to print out a current declarations page for you. This document will show you the policy limits for your structure, contents and additional living expenses.

**Duties under the policy**

There are certain ‚Äúduties‚Äù within the policy that you have to perform after a loss in order keep your policy in force and receive the benefits to which you are entitled. One of those duties is to prevent additional damage. This means getting broken windows and doors boarded up to prevent theft and additional damage from the elements.

Have any roof damage tarped or temporarily covered. This cost will be reimbursed or paid by the insurance company. It is your responsibility to protect your property from further damage, not the adjuster. Most adjusters will know of company‚Äôs who can do this for you.

It is common to be asked to give a recorded statement. Take it seriously and be absolutely honest with every answer. Make sure you have them agree, while the tape is running, to give you a copy of the tape as well as the transcript if the recording is transcribed.

Do not allow anyone to demolish or tear out any of the damaged components. Until the structural portion of the claim is completely and finally settled the structure should remain as is. According to your policy, you have a duty to allow for the inspection of all damaged property. Destroying the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù will only hurt your chances of getting fairly and completely indemnified.


**Additional Living Expenses (ALE)**

Don‚Äôt allow the insurance company to put you into temporary housing that is half the size of your damaged home. You are entitled to maintain your normal standard of living. So for the sake of your marriage and your kids, insist on accommodations and furnishings that are similar to what you enjoyed prior to the loss. The claim process is going to take longer than you are imagining right now. You will regret it if you disregard this little piece of advice, I promise.

Keep all receipts for everything purchased during this process: new clothes, laundry, eating out, etc. Just put all of them in one big envelope or file folder. You can sort them out later as you need them. This is particularly true for dining expenses. Your insurance company only owes you for any money that you spend over and above what you normally spend to eat so don‚Äôt go eating ‚Äúhigh on the hog‚Äù thinking that the adjuster will pay for everything.
Your ALE benefits also include any furniture you might need to rent in order to have appropriate living conditions (beds to sleep in, TVs to watch etc‚Ä¶). Don‚Äôt‚Äô go buying new furniture to put into your rental house/apartment because you just risk getting it banged up and scratched when you move it back to your repaired home.
If you have to drive further to work, or to your kid‚Äôs school then you will need to keep a detailed log (date, miles, and purpose) of the additional miles you incur. You are entitled to be reimbursed for this additional expense. This also holds true for the trips you might make to your damaged home to meet with adjusters, pick up the mail or feed your animals.

**Personal Property Inventory**

As soon as possible take lots of pictures of the damage, inside and out. The more the merrier. Good wide-angle shots of everything and close-ups of specifics in the most damaged areas. Things are going to disappear from the home during this process and you will be glad to have these photos.
Ask friends and family members if they have any photos of the interior of your house that may have been taken at a birthday party or some celebration around the holidays. These pictures could be extremely helpful in re-creating what was lost in the fire or tornado.

If you are too tired or too busy to put together a complete and comprehensive list of all damaged items (including spatulas, half bottles of shampoo, picture frames etc‚Ä¶) then please get some help from an inventory specialist. They will more than ‚Äúpay their way‚Äù and take a real headache off of your plate.
Do not throw away any clothes or furniture until your adjuster has given you written authorization allowing you to do so.


**Time**

Resist the natural inclination to be in a hurry to settle your claim and see quick progress. In the long run, it will be well worth the extra time to work out a proper settlement. Speed is the enemy of a good claim and any impatience you show will be used against you.
Don‚Äôt hire any Public Adjuster until you have received a copy of the insurance company‚Äôs estimate of repair. It makes no sense to pay someone a percentage of what the insurance company is going to offer you anyway and you won‚Äôt know whether you are going to be treated fairly, or unfairly until you get your estimate. Anybody you might consider hiring to help you with your claim ought to be compensated only for the new money that they can add to the structural part of your claim.

Be very careful and go slow before you consider hiring the adjuster‚Äôs ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù contractor. They tend to have a very close relationship with the adjusters and, as a result, are often more interested in keeping them happy than you, the policyholder. You are a source for one job for them, but your adjuster is a potential source for many jobs both now and in the future.

Absolutely do NOT hire any contractor without first seeing a complete detailed estimate of what he intends to do and how much it will cost. This is your home, and probably your largest investment. Make sure anything you sign prior to getting a complete estimate is only allowing for temporary repair or mitigation type work ‚Äì very limited authorization.",1583251938,fjdf4t7

I just think of how devastated and disoriented I'd be after fearing for my life and then having everything destroyed; especially the emotionally important ones which can't be replaced. It would be very hard to make good decisions and to understand the whole process.

Honestly in that situation people could use some grief counselling so if anyone knows psychologists willing to donate their time that would be a great. If you know any community officials, I think it would be a good thing to offer a public meeting where people can come together and have someone to speak about what to expect and how to best handle the trauma. Meeting more people who've been through than you knew before can be helpful.

2. As a college kid (Go Vols!!!) I don‚Äôt eat at expensive places much but definitely check out Gavinos, Blackhorse Pub and Brewery, and Cruze Farms!!! 

3. I don‚Äôt fish but maybe check out ijams? Not sure if you can fish there 

4. Ijams is a nice place to hike!! They also have a quarry to paddle board or kayak for like $12 and they provide the equipment for you. Also definitely check out the Smoky Mountains and any state parks around Knoxville!! UT Gardens is also pretty but not sure if you‚Äôd get more than an hour or two out of it. Tennessee is gorgeous with lots of outdoorsy area :-) 

5. Definitely! I don‚Äôt know any places specifically but there are shooting ranges pretty much everywhere in the south. Axe throwing is also a new trend that is popping up some places, but not sure if Knoxville has an axe throwing place yet. 

6. I‚Äôm 19 so I don‚Äôt know too many adult evenings places but check out Old City, Market Square or Gay Street! 

7. If you don‚Äôt want to deal with a lot of college aged kids try to stay away from Fort Sanders and Cumberland Ave haha

8. If you‚Äôre still in Tennessee when football season starts- go to a UT Volunteers game!!! Neyland stadium is one of my favorite places, the energy is insane win or lose!!! Kinda loud and crazy but sooo fun (especially if you know the words to Rocky Top!!) Also if you‚Äôre ever wanting to do a weekend trip you should definitely check out Nashville!!!

Minutes after the Senate's actions, a House committee similarly considered the bill, hearing from a few speakers, but delayed a vote.

The measure contains a provision that would extend the right to military members who are 18- to 20-years-old.

Tennesseans who legally want to buy a handgun would still have to pass the federal background check, although there are some loopholes to the requirement.

Paying someone ANY money on monies that you were going to get anyway doesn‚Äôt make sense in the slightest, but people make rash decisions when their lives have been thrown into upheaval. 

File your claim. Get all communication with your carrier in writing. Wait for their offer. Get their estimate reviewed (for free if possible). Then make the decision to hire help. Not before then. 

With that said I know everyone likes to think their adjuster, and their carrier, is their friend (nationwide is on your side, like a good neighbor State Farm is there, all state you‚Äôre in good hands, etc), but it‚Äôs not your adjusters job to maximize your claim. It‚Äôs their job to manage it. 

Make no mistake. This is going to be a large loss for all insurance carriers, and they will do what they can to minimize their losses. Even if it‚Äôs at the expense of those who have suffered. 

Below I will have included a step by step guide on what to do after a catastrophe. 

Stay safe everyone, 

Your local insurance specialist 



No one ever expects a fire or tornado destroy their home or building. Those kinds of things happen to other people. Being the victim of a catastrophic loss doesn‚Äôt mean you have to allow yourself to become a victim a second time by relinquishing the control of your claim to others and, as a result, having a less than favorable outcome. Following are some tips and suggestions that will help you ADAPT and stay in command of your claim so that you set yourself up to maximize your settlement. So when the unexpected does happen to you, and hundreds of thousands of dollars are hanging in the balance, just ADAPT.

**Adjuster**

Put any request for information or answers in writing to the adjuster. It will send them a very obvious message that you are taking this claim seriously and it will force them to respond in kind. What is in writing carries infinitely more weight than what is spoken.
Your first request ought to be to ask your adjuster in writing to provide you a complete copy of your policy with all forms and endorsements. The policy is the instruction manual for the claim. You will need an up-to-date copy. It is free. Again ‚Äì ask for it in writing.
Your adjuster is going to keep a written log of all activity associated with your claim (including conversations with you). It would be prudent for you to do likewise. Don‚Äôt let the insurance company be the only one documenting the claim.

While you wait for the certified policy, ask your insurance adjuster or agent to print out a current declarations page for you. This document will show you the policy limits for your structure, contents and additional living expenses.

**Duties under the policy**

There are certain ‚Äúduties‚Äù within the policy that you have to perform after a loss in order keep your policy in force and receive the benefits to which you are entitled. One of those duties is to prevent additional damage. This means getting broken windows and doors boarded up to prevent theft and additional damage from the elements.

Have any roof damage tarped or temporarily covered. This cost will be reimbursed or paid by the insurance company. It is your responsibility to protect your property from further damage, not the adjuster. Most adjusters will know of company‚Äôs who can do this for you.

It is common to be asked to give a recorded statement. Take it seriously and be absolutely honest with every answer. Make sure you have them agree, while the tape is running, to give you a copy of the tape as well as the transcript if the recording is transcribed.

Do not allow anyone to demolish or tear out any of the damaged components. Until the structural portion of the claim is completely and finally settled the structure should remain as is. According to your policy, you have a duty to allow for the inspection of all damaged property. Destroying the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù will only hurt your chances of getting fairly and completely indemnified.


**Additional Living Expenses (ALE)**

Don‚Äôt allow the insurance company to put you into temporary housing that is half the size of your damaged home. You are entitled to maintain your normal standard of living. So for the sake of your marriage and your kids, insist on accommodations and furnishings that are similar to what you enjoyed prior to the loss. The claim process is going to take longer than you are imagining right now. You will regret it if you disregard this little piece of advice, I promise.

Keep all receipts for everything purchased during this process: new clothes, laundry, eating out, etc. Just put all of them in one big envelope or file folder. You can sort them out later as you need them. This is particularly true for dining expenses. Your insurance company only owes you for any money that you spend over and above what you normally spend to eat so don‚Äôt go eating ‚Äúhigh on the hog‚Äù thinking that the adjuster will pay for everything.
Your ALE benefits also include any furniture you might need to rent in order to have appropriate living conditions (beds to sleep in, TVs to watch etc‚Ä¶). Don‚Äôt‚Äô go buying new furniture to put into your rental house/apartment because you just risk getting it banged up and scratched when you move it back to your repaired home.
If you have to drive further to work, or to your kid‚Äôs school then you will need to keep a detailed log (date, miles, and purpose) of the additional miles you incur. You are entitled to be reimbursed for this additional expense. This also holds true for the trips you might make to your damaged home to meet with adjusters, pick up the mail or feed your animals.

**Personal Property Inventory**

As soon as possible take lots of pictures of the damage, inside and out. The more the merrier. Good wide-angle shots of everything and close-ups of specifics in the most damaged areas. Things are going to disappear from the home during this process and you will be glad to have these photos.
Ask friends and family members if they have any photos of the interior of your house that may have been taken at a birthday party or some celebration around the holidays. These pictures could be extremely helpful in re-creating what was lost in the fire or tornado.

If you are too tired or too busy to put together a complete and comprehensive list of all damaged items (including spatulas, half bottles of shampoo, picture frames etc‚Ä¶) then please get some help from an inventory specialist. They will more than ‚Äúpay their way‚Äù and take a real headache off of your plate.
Do not throw away any clothes or furniture until your adjuster has given you written authorization allowing you to do so.


**Time**

Resist the natural inclination to be in a hurry to settle your claim and see quick progress. In the long run, it will be well worth the extra time to work out a proper settlement. Speed is the enemy of a good claim and any impatience you show will be used against you.
Don‚Äôt hire any Public Adjuster until you have received a copy of the insurance company‚Äôs estimate of repair. It makes no sense to pay someone a percentage of what the insurance company is going to offer you anyway and you won‚Äôt know whether you are going to be treated fairly, or unfairly until you get your estimate. Anybody you might consider hiring to help you with your claim ought to be compensated only for the new money that they can add to the structural part of your claim.

Be very careful and go slow before you consider hiring the adjuster‚Äôs ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù contractor. They tend to have a very close relationship with the adjusters and, as a result, are often more interested in keeping them happy than you, the policyholder. You are a source for one job for them, but your adjuster is a potential source for many jobs both now and in the future.

Absolutely do NOT hire any contractor without first seeing a complete detailed estimate of what he intends to do and how much it will cost. This is your home, and probably your largest investment. Make sure anything you sign prior to getting a complete estimate is only allowing for temporary repair or mitigation type work ‚Äì very limited authorization.",1583363762,fjiaww2

4710,Faera,"As an adjuster (albeit in a different country), I would say this is mostly pretty good advice. Though I would say, the implication that insurers will minimize their losses at the expense of victims is a bit misleading. Most of the time Insurers are actually much more afraid of PR problems from problematic claims. They will be very strict with policy requirements and conditions but they will be very careful not to have even the appearance of refusing to pay a claim that is justified. 

Yes you can ask the adjuster for a copy of your policy documents but really you should have a copy yourself in any case. In these catastrophe situations, a lot of the time the adjuster doesn't even get the policy documentation until much later because there's so much to be done and the instructions are sent out urgently without the supporting documentation so that the inspections can be done as quickly as possible. 

Putting everything in writing is good advice, and yes the adjuster will certainly keep records of conversations so it's a good idea for you to do so as well. 

Keeping all receipts and taking as many photographs as possible is also extremely helpful and tells the adjuster that you are organized and keeping track of things, which makes it much the claim much easier to assess and recommend. 

Also very much agree that you should see a detailed scope of works before agreeing to any settlement. In terms of the adjuster's preferred contractor, very often this is because the contractor is on a panel that the Insurers agree to use and trust, which can very much speed up matters. If you choose your own contractor there will often be a lengthy and contentious process of justifying items of works on the scope, whether this is like-for-like and whether the costs are justified. It's doable and can be better if you know what you're doing and what you want, but as an adjuster it can be a real headache when there is any disagreement. With preferred contractors the Insurers know what they are going to get and have much more leverage with them (i.e. can punish them if they consistently overcharge or do bad work) so they are much more willing to accept their recommendations with less scrutiny. They also generally know what Insurers need and are willing to accept under the policy so this makes the process a lot faster. Having said that, the disadvantage is that they are more likely to try to minimize costs because their customer is the Insurer not you, so you will need to be very careful that they are actually doing the work properly and not cutting corners. So yes there are good reasons to use preferred contractors, but OP is right that you need to be careful with them as well.",1583378862,fjiypq8
4711,basscat474,Yes true ‚Äúanyone‚Äù can get the permit and pay the fee.

Hey OP... I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house. The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters. I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.

Our goal was to use the information you provided, and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.

For instance, if all you say was ""toaster"" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time. And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned. We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were. We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote. To further that example:

If you said ""toaster - $25"" , we would have to be within -20% of that... so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.01.

If you said ""toaster- $200"" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.)

If you said ""toaster, from Walmart"" , you're getting that $4.88 one.

If you said ""toaster, from Macys"" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.

If you said ""toaster"", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc., you would probably get a matching one.

If you said ""Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9"", you just got yourself $9.

If you said ""High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button"" ... you might get $35-50 instead. We had to match all features that were listed.

I'm not telling you to lie on your claim. Not at all. That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.e., invalidating the entire claim). But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time. Pay attention to those last two examples.

I remember one specific customer... he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder. Worth like $5 at a scrap yard. It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy strongly insisted that we replace with ""Like Kind And Quality"" (trigger words). Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies). $65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.

Remember to list fucking every -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of. For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:

Designer Shower Curtain - $35

Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15

Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15

Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35

Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15

Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19

Holder for Loofahs - $20

Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)

Bath bomb - from Lush - $12

High end shampoo - from salon - $40

High end conditioner - from salon - $40

Refining pore mask - from salon - $55

I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower. Nothing there is ""unreasonable"" , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake. The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned. No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through. The adjuster has other shit to do, too.

Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (it's just some used soap and sponges..) -- and those people would be losing out on $400.

Some things require documentation &amp; ages. If you say ""tv - $2,000"" -- you're getting a 32"" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts. Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.

If you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house. Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook. Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you think you purchased from Restoration Hardware. Like... seriously... come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive.

The fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value. You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut. But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up ""creatively"" for the insurance company to process.

Sometimes people would come back to us with ""updated* claims. They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like ""toaster"", ""microwave"", ""tv"" .. and weren't happy with what they got back. So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with ""more information."" I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated.

You do not want a big claim; it will affect your premiums. Not just next year but pretty much until you stop having insurance. Your insurance company is not worried about their claims spending... they have billions of dollars just lying around. They use this money to generate more money whilst maintaining enough liquidity to pay claims.

He always told me the people who did best out of it took a quick settlement knowing it was less than they were truly owed but they then offloaded their property quickly.

The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters.  I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.

Our goal was to use the information you provided,  and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.

For instance, if all you say was ""toaster"" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time.  And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned.  We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were.  We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote.  To further that example:

-  If you said ""toaster - $25""  , we would have to be within -20% of that... so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.01.  
-  If you said ""toaster- $200"" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.)   
-  If you said ""toaster, from Walmart"" , you're getting that $4.88 one.
-  If you said ""toaster, from Macys"" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.
-  If you said ""toaster"", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc., you would probably get a matching one.
-  If you said ""Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9"", you just got yourself $9.  
-  If you said ""High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button"" ... you might get $35-50 instead.  We *had* to match all features that were listed.  

I'm not telling you to lie on your claim.  Not at all.  That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.e., invalidating the entire claim).  But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time.  Pay attention to those last two examples.

I remember one specific customer... he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder.  Worth like $5 at a scrap yard.  It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy *strongly insisted* that we replace with ""Like Kind And Quality"" (trigger words).  Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies).   $65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.  

Remember to *list fucking every* -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of.  For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:

-  Designer Shower Curtain  -  $35
-  Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15
-  Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15
-  Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35
-  Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15
-  Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19
-  Holder for Loofahs - $20
-  Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)
-  Bath bomb - from Lush - $12
-  High end shampoo - from salon - $40
-  High end conditioner - from salon - $40
-  Refining pore mask - from salon - $55

I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower.  Nothing there is ""unreasonable""  , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake.  The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned.  No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through.  The adjuster has other shit to do, too.  

Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (*it's just some used soap and sponges..*)  -- and those people would be losing out on $400.  


Some things require documentation &amp; ages.  If you say ""tv - $2,000""  -- you're getting a 32"" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts.  Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.    

If you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house.  Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook.  Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you *think* you purchased from Restoration Hardware.  Like... seriously... come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive.  

The fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value.  You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut.  But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up ""creatively"" for the insurance company to process.  

Sometimes people would come back to us with ""updated* claims.  They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like ""toaster"", ""microwave"", ""tv"" .. and weren't happy with what they got back.  So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with ""more information.""  I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated.  (It's amazing what can happen when people suddenly ""remember"" their entire wardrobe came from Nordstrom.)

4806,Angerman5000,"It can vary a bit by state (some states are no-fault which are totally different from the majority, research if you live in one), but the same sorts of general advice are solid: get everything in writing regarding your claim, estimates for work, etc. Specifically ask about where work needs to be done. If they have a preferred option, check it out: sometimes they do good work; sometimes they do cheap/fast work. But make sure that you confirm where you take the car is a place that will be covered. My company, for example, doesn't care, as long as the place is a certified body shop. So I called the nearest dealership, and asked who they recommended for work, and took it there once I checked their ratings. Get pictures of all the damage, but also try and get pictures of the accident location and tire marks that show what happened. If you're sure you're going to need to make a claim to repair the damage, get a police report. Check in every few days and get solid dates on when things will happen, like an adjuster checking out your vehicle's damage. 

In general, if you have super cheap insurance rates through a national carrier, expect your customer service experience to be worse. Anecdotally, places like that are often tough to deal with for claims because they're constantly flooded with them, and charge low rates so they need to minimize payouts to maintain a profit. I work for a statewide, rather than national, insurance company, and getting my claim taken care of when a drunk driver hit my car (while it was parked in a driveway) was comparatively easy and fast. It still took over a month before I was in a new car, and took even longer to settle the car payments with GAP insurance.

Japan's government stated the best thing you can do to prevent yourself from catching it is wear a mask. Japan also is a large supplier of masks, they have a decent supply.

Additionally, Hong Kong has the virus contained (only 100 cases) eventhough they are on the frontline (everyone wants to come to HK from china if they have it, because HK has much better healthcare). The head of for the Centre for infection said the reason the outbreak was prevented in HK is because 95% wore masks.  They also have a solid supply due to china.

If there was a supply, the government would be recommending wearing a mask.

Edit: And I'll add this quote.  A more specialized mask, known as an N95 respirator, can protect against the new [coronavirus](https://www.livescience.com/what-are-coronaviruses.html), also called SARS-CoV-2. The respirator is thicker than a surgical mask, but neither Schaffner nor the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) recommend it for public use, at least not at this point.

4816,reverendfrag4,"You are spreading false information.

&gt;Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.  
The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes.‚ÄØ Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.

4817,randoreds,"Can you not read? unlike N95 masks.

Correct surgical masks do not protect. N95 (which are different that the facemasks that the passage you posted is talking about) its literally their job. Like how I like to explain things, N95 masks prevent 95% of bad things. There is also the N99 and I believe the N100. The n95 and n99 are easy to wear, the n100 are like the gasmask things.

Edit: stay safe. china literally quarantined a city basically as big as nyc. And its still in quarantine. We can only guess the economic impact. Its crushing their economy. Now, this is a guess, but I think its logical. If they went to such an extreme measure, we in the west should take this serious. I work for nyc's public hospitals.

The other argument someone else was making much stronger. Keep supplies for medical professionals. I agree with. Hospitals don't really buy from the same channel that the consumer buys from. But this is more a government issue, they cannot supply masks. That is their mistake. They do not have masks available. Other governments do, the US does not. Most of hospitals are strictly restricting the use of masks. Some of them don't even have them. They use those glass shields. 

But from my perspective, the cdc/the central government can't trusted till they get their shit together. Here in New York. We are only starting to get cases because they have just started testing them. We have only tested 35 people in a city of 11 million. And with those, we have positives. Think of how many more people have it. The manhattan lawyer who tested positive 2nd. His wife, his daughter, his son, his neighbor who drove him to the hospital got it.

&gt;Don‚Äôt allow the insurance company to put you into temporary housing that is half the size of your damaged home. You are entitled to maintain your normal standard of living. So for the sake of your marriage and your kids, insist on accommodations and furnishings that are similar to what you enjoyed prior to the loss.

I would offer a *slight* caveat with this.  Obviously you shouldn't let yourself be put in a hovel with mold and crack dealers banging on the walls next door, but some catastrophe claims can take a *long* time to get fully resolved, and many home policies have a defined cap on how much they'll pay for loss of  use.  If you live in a 2 million dollar house and demand a similar standard of living, the insurance company will pay it, but depending on the area you're talking thousands of dollars a month in rent.  You know what's worse than living below your normal standard for ""free""? Having to pay entirely out of pocket to stay at your normal standards renting a mansion when your loss of use runs out.

4841,Ogre213,"I work in insurance, and a couple of points here.  There are two different types of insurance companies in the US (broadly speaking) - mutuals and publics.  Publics have stockholders; in mutuals, the policyholders are the stockholders.  Care to guess which ones are more interested in minimizing claims vs taking care of their claimants?  Mutuals often look more expensive, but they return part of that money as a dividend.  USAA is a great example of that, and one that anybody qualified to buy should get a quote from (I do NOT work for USAA).

Second, insurance is a contract.  It's a legal instrument; someone who buys a policy that doesn't cover a loss, knowing it doesn't cover a loss, and then tries to make their insurer cover a loss isn't a victim; they're at best desperate and at worst committing fraud.  If your insurer is trying to avoid paying for something they should pay on, that's a different matter, but that's also very rare in the property world.  Read your contract before you buy it; all policies are not the same and exclusions differ from company to company.

For those who can‚Äôt access the link, here‚Äôs the article: 

In Tennessee, state legislators have introduced House Bill 2576 (HB2576) that would criminalize the provision of gender-affirming medical care to transgender youth. The proposed bill would label standard medical care, as outlined by The American Academy of Pediatrics and The Endocrine Society as child abuse.


Physicians and other experts on the mental health of transgender youth, [author Jack Turner] included, have been speaking out against the bill, noting that it contains dangerous medical misinformation. We highlight that bill would cause serious harm to vulnerable adolescents if passed.


Nearly 100 physicians, researchers, and clinicians who treat transgender youth and youth with gender dysphoria have signed onto a letter to Governor Bill Lee asking that he and politicians in the state fight this dangerous bill.

‚ÄúDear Governor Lee:

As physicians, researchers, and clinicians who focus on the mental health of children and adolescents, we are writing to express grave concerns regarding HB2576. The bill contains assertions that are scientifically inaccurate and misleading claims. Furthermore, the bill would harm vulnerable children and adolescents:

We want to first draw your attention to the medical misinformation and misleading claims in the bill. First, the bill states that ‚Äúthe majority of pre-pubescent children who claim a gender identity different from their biological sex will ultimately identify with their biological sex by young adulthood or sooner when supported through their natural puberty.‚Äù This claim is false, as outlined in The Journal of The American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry. Furthermore, under current guidelines set forth by The Endocrine Society, medical interventions are not offered until the onset of puberty, making this statement irrelevant to the matter at hand. Once adolescents reach puberty (i.e. the timepoint when medical intervention is considered), it is rare for adolescents with gender dysphoria to stop identifying as a gender different from their sex assigned at birth. The bill goes on to state that ‚Äú[gender-affirming medical treatments] carry elevated risks of mental illness‚Ä¶ and may even contribute to suicide.‚Äù This is also false. To the contrary, a recent study in the journal Pediatrics found that access to pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents was associated with dramatically lower odds of suicidal ideation. Other studies have similarly shown that gender-affirming medical care for adolescents results in improved mental health outcomes. There is no evidence that these medical interventions worsen the mental health of young people. Additionally, these medications have been shown to be medically safe.

Despite being standard medical care for the treatment of gender dysphoria, as has been highlighted by The American Academy of Pediatrics, The Endocrine Society, and The American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, it is extremely difficult for young people to access this medical care. In a recent study, fewer than 3% of transgender people who desired pubertal suppression during adolescence were able to receive it. HB2576 would put in place unnecessary barriers to care that would make access to these treatments even more difficult. This would undoubtedly result in worsening mental health for this vulnerable patient population. For a population with a 40% suicide attempt rate, this is unacceptable.

In summary, HB2576 contains inaccurate scientific assertions and misleading claims. If it were to become law, it would create barriers to medical care that would result in significant damage to the mental health of a vulnerable pediatric patient population. We strongly urge legislators to oppose this bill.‚Äù

Signatories for the letter include doctors from The University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Yale School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Brown University School of Public Health, New York University School of Medicine, The Cleveland Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Tufts School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, among others.",1583612961,fju2olz

5001,crusty_mustache,"Well, my brothers house a few miles away from me, in Cookeville, off of 70, was one of the few on his street that wasn't completely flattened.  He lost part of his roof.  Nothing else except some windows.  Glass, water, and a bit of wind damage on the exterior, but he literally lost nothing.  Yes his widsheld did bust out and he suffered some damage on his piece of crap truck. Oh a BBQ he lost that was given to him. Maybe some outside kid toys and loads of trash and cigarette butts and ashtrays.


He was a renter.  The homeowner suffered more damage.  11 people in his neighborhood died.  Houses flattened.  But let me tell you something....


My fucking brother, 43, has a baby with a 28 year old and happened to have thrown her and their newborn out that night.  So luckily they weren't there.  


They go and start a private fundraiser on Facebook lying about every detail.  Things they lost were a lie, things about their renters' insurance a big fat lie.  They never had any.  They went into detail about how she had to hold the bathroom door closed, and she wasn't even there.  Lied about losing ""thousands of dollars"" in building materials and tools.  All his tools were fine and absolutely no building materials were in their possession.

She was asking for 2K on Facebook and thus far receive 400$ in less than 24 hours before they blocked me.  

She said she had to quit work early because of maternity complications in her plea for help, which is another lie.  She worked up to a week before delivery.

I am so disgusted that they are lying in order to get cash donations for something that this community is willing to give in a split second.

I told my father and I think my dad might have been pissed at him.  My brother and his baby momma blocked me so...  

Yea that's my week. I was at their house and walked 2 miles through the carnage to make sure they were ok.

5019,tgjer,"The new laws are unbelievably fucked up. They are attempting to criminalize desperately needed, frequently life saving medical care.

Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the *""kids are being castrated!""* and *""90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition!""* concern trolling:

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

[**This article**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/opinion/transgender-children-medical-bills.html) has a pretty good basic overview.

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. The [**American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) for the treatment of trans and GNC youth cover the origins of this myth, why it has been debunked, and what the actual best treatment for these kids is.

For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

And ""regret"" rates among trans surgical patients (who again, are all young adults or older) are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. This includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And ""regret"" rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.

* [**Care of the Patient Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)**](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) \- *Persistent regret among post-operative transsexuals has been studied since the early 1960s. The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.*

Lupron belongs to a class of drugs called gonadotrophin hormone-releasing (GnRH) agonists and is used to suppress estrogen production, thereby delaying the physical changes of puberty in a pre-pubescent female patient.

The argument is that this will give the girl more time to ‚Äúexplore her identity,‚Äù an easier path to physical transitioning before her body matures, and a chance to decide if she wants to pursue more serious measures such as cross-sex hormones and surgery. The first claim is that Lupron is safe. But thousands of patients who have been treated with Lupron for non-sex-related conditions would disagree.

Very little data is available on the long-term safety on GnRH analog treatment in boys in terms of reproductive function, body composition and bone health (which have been better explored in girls) [1]. The outcomes of untreated boys are largely unknown, too, so, comparison between treated and untreated subjects is impossible.

Being overweight is reported as a long-term concern of GnRH analog therapy in girls with CPP [57, 58]. In boys, Palmert et al. [59] demonstrate that the body mass index (BMI) is above the 85 percentile in approximately 50% of the GnRH analog-treated boys at discontinuation of therapy

In summary, CPP and its treatment in men have been so far poorly evaluated.


Comparative randomized studies among the various formulations and schedules of treatment are lacking but are highly advisable. Further studies on larger series of boys with CPP are also needed to better define the criteria for starting and stopping the GnRH analog treatment to optimize the outcome.

Wash your hands. 

Covid 19 is almost exclusively killing people over 50. Try to protect older people by not exposing then to people. It's not killing babies somehow. This could change so still be careful, but it's comforting for now. 

Wash your hands. Learn [proper hand washing technique. ](https://i.imgur.com/UPCbvQk.jpg) if you're not already washing at least 5 times a day you're more likely to get an infection. You should wash more than that right now. 

Don't touch your face. 

Cover your cough with your sleeve; not your palm. 

Surgical masks are only really good for keeping particles out of the air if somebody is having trouble covering their cough. If somebody is immunocompromised and has to go to a hospital or something where they may be exposed they should explain their situation to the staff. They probably still won't get an n95 respirator, because without proper fit testing it probably won't work. This is a little more detailed reason why the news keeps saying not to bother with masks. 

Bleach kills viruses. If the store is out of Clorox wipes and all that you can [mix one cup of bleach with one gallon of water](https://i.imgur.com/9Nvt1SN.jpg) to make your own and it will work great.

Essential oils smell good but they're not medicine. Don't let your grandma die because they think they're immune to respiratory viruses after diffusing some ""breathe"" oil.

The cells in the rest of the body nothing at all to do with it.   There are optimally two periods of exceptionally high hormone washes during gestation and in the first year of life.

Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the *""kids are being castrated!""* and *""90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition!""* concern trolling:

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

[**This article**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/opinion/transgender-children-medical-bills.html) has a pretty good basic overview.

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. The [**American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) for the treatment of trans and GNC youth cover the origins of this myth, why it has been debunked, and what the actual best treatment for these kids is.

For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

And ""regret"" rates among trans surgical patients (who again, are all young adults or older) are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. This includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And ""regret"" rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.

* [**Care of the Patient Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)**](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) \- *Persistent regret among post-operative transsexuals has been studied since the early 1960s. The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS.

Seems like it was written out of fear but mostly ignorance. We simply do not know enough about the human brain to make any claims other than that these people believe a change will make them happier in life.

What we do know is that everyone starts off as a female in the womb and sometimes there are physical sexual developmental diseases that occur for multiple reasons including the gender switch that happens there not happening completely. Also, other physical things we can see or that make it harder to differentiate which gender someone is like 5Œ±-reductase deficiency, Androgen insensitivity syndrome, CAIS and PAIS.

Also things that develop later like Aromatase excess syndrome or reddit's favorite Diphallia.

So if all of these exist why couldn't there be similar switches in the brain that weren't flipped in the womb that we can't actually see and currently know little about?

Better not use our own brain's and the evidence surrounding us when thinking about it as it's simply much easier and comfortable for some to call them brain damaged or brain washed.",1583777246,fk1d53p

But regarding my attitude...I am just fed up with all the small talk time wasting loops that people want to go through regarding topics that shouldn't even be discussed. The truth of the matter is that gun crimes are a matter of the person not a matter of the gun and nothing more. I can commit a crime with a toothpick and stab your eyes out just as I could shoot you though there is no difference because either way it was my decision that I made to do that and that is what is punishable not the access which is a freedom two things that could harm somebody.

&gt;  
&gt;IMO, the Tennessee General Assembly should legalize marijuana for all adults across the state and allow adults to grow reasonable amounts of marijuana for both their own adult household use and nominal amounts that adult Tennesseans could sell through private transactions to the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, I am thinking that perhaps the only legal marijuana item that should be nominally taxed by the State of Tennessee would be marijuana seeds - and those legalized marijuana seeds should only be subject to sales taxes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current 'medical marijuana' legislation being considered within the Tennessee General Assembly is being set up to allow those politically-connected to state general assembly members (and Tennessee General Assembly members themselves) to profit from the state-enforced ""medical marijuana"" monopolies for these proposed legalized medical marijuana growers and dispensary owners.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am thinking that legalized marijuana In Tennessee should be as easy to grow in your home garden as your favorite tomatoes or cucumbers - you could visit a local retailer (or place an online order through the internet) to purchase packets of legalized marijuana seeds that would be nominally subjected to state and local sales taxes.  
&gt;  
&gt;And just like if you should happen to have an excess harvest of tomatoes, cucumbers, or legalized marijuana, adult Tennesseans should be allowed to freely transfer or sell their home-grown produce to other adults through private transactions or farmers' markets - the more legalized marijuana that enters into market in Tennessee would lower the prices of legalized marijuana across Tennessee and would take away the illicit profits derived from illegal marijuana currently being sold by drug dealers in Tennessee.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current medical marijuana legislation before the Tennessee General Assembly limits number of ""businesses"" that could sell medical marijuana - under the proposed legislation, the Tennessee medical marijuana monopolies that would be created by the state would number just six growing businesses to cultivate marijuana and up to 75 standalone medical marijuana dispensaries.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree that stemming the flood of pills into the state would be a great start to stopping the opiate epidemic. Just for some numbers, states with medical marijuana have seen decreases in opiate prescriptions [(5.88% reduction by this study)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/04/02/legal-marijuana-states-have-lower-opioid-use-new-studies-show/) and opiate related deaths [(for recreational: 20-35% reduced mortality, less for more restrictive legalization like medicinal).](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190807092350.htm)

About blaming the chinese alone for the opiate epidemic, I get it. It‚Äôs easiest to just point the finger at the chinese and say that that‚Äôs the only problem but just read up on Purdue Pharma‚Äôs cash cow OxyContin (which they said wasn‚Äôt addictive when the first released it until the 2000s) and watch ‚ÄúThe Pharmacist‚Äù on Netflix. It‚Äôs a documentary about Louisiana, but it could just as easily be about East Tennessee because the story is the same all over the nation and it will blow your mind.

The computer performed simulations on more than 8,000 components and narrowed it down to, what they believe, is the right sample to fight the virus. Now, the researchers plan to test the digital remedy on an actual sample.

50 compounds were being tested in a lab in Memphis.

Two researchers the University of Tennessee in Knoxville have discovered a chemical compound that, if it passes more testing, could be the cure to stop coronavirus and prevent it from spreading. Some people are working on vaccines, which is something different.

What we‚Äôre talking about here is a drug someone would take if they develop symptoms for example, to stop the virus from doing its thing. You have to find a chemical that wants to talk to the virus, a chemical that will bind to one of the targets, one of the weak points the virus has and disrupt its activity. Not only that, you don‚Äôt want your chemical doing other things in the human body that are bad for it, so the drug has to reach its target and it has be efficacious at disrupting the virus and it has to be safe.

We also have a responsibility to the larger community to do our part with precautionary decisions and actions. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 on campus, in Cookeville or Putnam County. However, after considering all the information available to us, we have made the following decisions:

Tennessee Tech will extend its spring break with no classes for students from March 16 through March 27. University offices will operate with regular hours. Faculty and staff are expected to report to work as usual. Anyone who is feeling ill is asked to stay home.

The university plans to transition from face-to-face instruction to online classes and alternate delivery on Monday, March 30. Students should take all technology and materials with them needed for their coursework when they leave campus for spring break. Students must regularly check their tntech.edu email for more information and updates.

For residential students who need to remain on campus, housing will be available on request to Residential Life.

While faculty have begun preparing for this type of transition, they will receive additional information and resources in coming days.

Many major campus events are cancelled. A list will be posted at https://www.tntech.edu/news/covid-19/index.php.

Athletic event cancellations will be determined in conjunction with the Ohio Valley Conference.

This illustrates quite well where systems like anarcho-capitalism break down - regulation to prevent this sort of price-gouging goes against the idea of ""pure capitalism"", but helps society as a whole.

The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it ""prisoner's dilemma"", presenting it as follows:



Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other.

Two weeks food, as some have suggested having on hand, may be on the skimpy side.

This doesn't mean you should buy all the toilet paper in town. It does mean that if you have some money on hand, you might consider upping the depth of your food pantry with non-perishable goods and medicines.

We could theoretically deal with this better than China. But there's no guarantee we will. And many of us are too poor to stock food and medicine.

And in a related bit of news, I think this may be the most useful thing I've read yet:  
https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca

I couldn't possibly sum it all up, because it's stunning in its depth, but I will mention one point: Chart 11: Timeline of Events in Hubei:  
https://imgur.com/a/oz6E6PT

By the time authorities had identified 100 cases of the virus in this province, there were already 1500 cases in reality, a huge lag of information due to lack of organized response.

It's risky at best to suppose that the same ratio would hold true for Tennessee (I have no over/under on better/worse), but as an exercise, let's see what things would look like if it did: 32 known cases x 15 unknown cases = 480 cases.

I have no trouble believing we have 500 cases in the state, and growing exponentially. I hope I'm wrong. I pray I'm wrong. I look forward to the day when fewer than 100 people die, and everyone on reddit makes fun of me for being gloomy and pessimistic. That would make me smile. I would totally own that and rejoice.

AGAIN: Don't panic buy. And don't panic. But make some smart, informed decisions this week. Think through your daily routine and extrapolate that forward for at least a month, and consider everything you and your family (and pets!) and friends will need if things get hairy.

None of us were expecting it, the stores were bare and supplies had the same issue that we had. We came together. A guy coordinated teams that could dig neighbors out. We saw carnage. Looters showed up and they got through. It was chaos and it felt like the world was ending. Not one person was hoarding. We were the first responders. We feed the fire crews and got them water as they battled to save our town, we certainly did not take water. I was thankful that I had flashlights and supplies for when the power goes out.

The [evidence](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1238970126889889793.html) is starting to come in that people are maximally contagious in the days right before and after symptoms start.  Which means that if we only close a school after someone is already diagnosed (assuming they can even get tested) it will be too late.

Its up to the states and local agencies to full the gap left by the CDC's failures, so meeting the CDC minimums isn't enough.  We are seriously looking at 1M+ dead nationwide if we don't start taking this seriously.

I'd say that actions (or inactions) taken that will knowingly (and he *knows* - his ignorance is willful) cause deaths *could* count as killing, even if the people aren't actually dying yet. Call it *mens rea*. (Note: I don't necessarily *agree* with that interpretation of the language, just trying to provide another viewpoint.)

As for what to do? Well, martial law might raise the general IQ a bit as all the hyper-libertarian nuts get themselves arrested or, in the worst cases, shot. But I don't think it would even begin to suffice for general containment. Might be able to enforce quarantine on the largest cities, but certainly not on the whole state. Call me a pessimist, but frankly I think it's too late for anything to stop us going into the fast spread paradigm. That ship (which did *not* involve martial law) sailed weeks if not *months* ago.

I think at this point, since containment is impossible, perhaps focus should shift more towards mitigation (though obviously distancing and quarantines should still be followed, of course). Setting up as many temporary medical facilities as possible, crash-course training people to work as (admittedly low-level) carers/techs, etc. Try and raise the capacity of our healthcare with regards to the medical complications of COVID-19 so that even when it drops due to infection of healthcare workers, we might still save more people than otherwise.",1584671155,fkzhk1y

6172,MrInternetToughGuy,"It‚Äôs probably because he wants minimal economic impact. Regardless of perspective on politics, a breakdown on economics locally would have worse effects. I‚Äôm split on this, only because of how difficult the situation is. Sure as hell glad I‚Äôm not governor at a time like this. 

The real problem is if local economy makes a turn for the worse then thus begins the rise of unemployment. A rise in unemployment would increases interaction not lessen it. Put a pin in that, I‚Äôll come back to it. When the local economy breaks down a multitude of once easy-to-get-items become far more rare. With the global problems just now starting to show themselves it doesn‚Äôt matter what it is: Medical supplies, food, equipment ranging from retail to medical, communications, and shit you don‚Äôt need but want.

The U.S. economic infrastructure is not setup to handle Americans NOT purchasing stuff. Period. This measly $1K they want to give Americans doesn‚Äôt even come close to covering that gap. Assume every adult in Nashville $1K. Cool. All you‚Äôve done is pump (according to Wikipedia the pop. of Nashville is roughly 700,000) $700k into the city economy. And that‚Äôs IF people spend every dime of it for the duration in which they‚Äôre giving out this money. Let‚Äôs say it lasts 6 months. The federal gov‚Äôt essentially only bought 6 houses in Brentwood. Congrats you managed to stuff $4.2M into an economy that had a GDP of 109 Billion in 2016. Yes that was 4 years ago and yes, I did the math, that‚Äôs 0.000038%. The U.S. federal gov‚Äôt effectively is really only assisting rural economies.

Back to unemployment, because people will get desperate, they will be actively trying to make ends meet. This will only increase the problems. As people have to leave their house to do so. It‚Äôs not preventable. The U.S. should take a chapter out of the Italian book a pause all payments for property loans, commercial or personal. The federal government needs to incentivize people to stay home for all this to settle down as soon as possible.

I don‚Äôt know what the fix is for Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville but a local stimulus directly into the hands of those who depend on hourly wages would be a good start. My wife and I are salaried and make enough. I‚Äôm not advocating for me. I‚Äôm advocating for those who make less than me.",1584674397,fkzmahr

The mortality rate for the Coronavirus is 2%, so about 200 people out of every 10,000.

Across the whole country that's a difference of millions of deaths.
   
Another big difference is the time from when you catch the virus to when you show symptoms.  For the swine flu, it was 1 to 4 days.  For the Coronavirus, it's 5 to 14 days.  You can have the virus for two weeks before showing symptoms while possibly transmitting it to others.",1584675504,fkznu87

We know what the incubation time for this virus is and understand that the only way to flatten the infection curve and thus prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed is early detection and quarantine. We are just now beginning to see the infection curve for china flattening and that was only possible because of their immediate response after 600 reported cases. That sort of quarantine I dont think can be replicated here, seeing as most people are simply not taking this seriously enough, and the numbers of people I hear still hear saying ""the flu killed more people"" reflects this. We have 1 confirmed case in Rutherford county, and likely hundreds of undiagnosed cases walking about exponentially infecting others and virtually little testing going on or any effective quarantine measures being discussed let alone put in place. Folks we dont live in a bubble, Italy has a first class healthcare system and they're overwhelmed. The time for decisive action by our local leaders is now! Not next week.",1584716233,fl0uv1c

How much firearms training have you had? Do you even know how much I've had, with whom and where used?

So many questions... But you are an online warrior who seems to believe that a government acting proactively to protect the rights and livelihoods of its citizens is a bridge too far. 

Look, TN has 154 reported cases with 1 reported death. Those numbers clearly reflect an undercount - we can debate that if need be. That undercount still shows a 0.7% death rate. There are roughly 6.5m people in Tennessee. 

New York has ~11,000 confirmed cases, with ~45 deaths. That's a 0.5% death rate in a population of 20m. More people density with lower mortality. California is doing even better. 

This means that social distancing and sheltering in place is more effective than letting people move freely. Moving aggressively quickly seems to make a world of difference.

The worst case projections are showing 2.2m deaths in the U.S. A disproportionate number of those deaths will occur in the South because hardly any action is being taken to limit the spread of transmission. The worst case scenario only occurs is little to no action is taken. 


People in NY, CA aren't letting the government do what it wants. I have mostly lived in New York and California until moving to TN. They are demanding the government serve them and protect the public welfare. That includes listening to experts, and keeping dumbasses from dumbassing.

There is a lot of screaming about rights and freedom here in TN. However, the key difference I've noticed is that if I treat government officials like they work for me, they seem very taken aback. They seem to be used to servile compliance, obedience and subservience. It is actually quite shocking to me. Anyone who needs my vote is my employee, not my master.

Maybe the reason people scream about rights here is because they don't really have them.

Look into Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York. They have one of the highest rated of Medicaid patients in the country. But they are consistently a multi-million dollar revenue generator with profits.

But the person who said that having a high number of patients who can't pay might be on to something. Receiving Medicaid reimbursement is much better than no reimbursement. A person without coverage of any kind is either self-paying (very few) or non-paying through the more expensive Emergency Department (usually the case). 

That is the cost curve that the ACA sought to bend. States that refused to accept the Federal government paying 100% of the onboarding costs and then 90% of the costs forever deprived their poorest citizens of a means to pay.

What's the situation like in TN? I'm not too far away maybe 8 hour drive but live a couple states over. Is she going to be able to get the surgery she needs?

6740,_Im_just_poopin,"Medicare does not pay a flat rate for services. CMS has been aggressively moving from the traditional fee for service model to a collection of payment programs generally referred to as fee for value. These new programs pay different amounts to different hospitals. Montefiore was, and might still be, in a program where hospitals are paid extra during the years that they improve things like interoperability, which is easier for them to implement than a hospital in the middle of nowhere because in the middle of nowhere, cost per patient is higher in rural areas because there are fewer patients.

People in rural areas tend to be fatter than those in Montefiore‚Äôs service area as well, which impacts both the type of care being received and the effectiveness of that care. Generally, care that is deemed less effective is compensated at a lower rate.

This lower patient volume also effects rural hospitals‚Äô ability to hire the same type of staff that Montefiore can, and this results in both more admin issues and a lower standard of care.

A big boost that Montefiore has over many rural areas is that NYS does not allow for-profit hospitals. They do not answer to shareholders who are seeking to maximize value. As long as they are able to show evidence-based necessity, the state will find many of their programs until they achieve financial viability. Breakeven is good enough. 

Medicare is still leans more heavily towards fee for service. You are right that there is a push towards VBP. But that is rolling out slowly. There are constant delays. 

As far interoperability, meaningful use dollars are not that much. I don't think that they would be enough to make or break a hospital.

6760,_Im_just_poopin,"The CMS‚Äôs various programs have shifted a ton. Montefiore was in a pioneer ACO, but now they‚Äôre in a different type. CMS is also constantly changing the shared savings program. I haven‚Äôt looked in depth at all of this for a year-and-a-half, but what I remember being in place was a system where in order to qualify for the best reimbursement rates, hospitals had to hit certain interoperability thresholds and other standard of care metrics. YoY improvement also impacted the payout, but I think they changed it all late in 2018, and it is changing again. I‚Äôm out of that industry, so my info is slightly old.

My point is that I expect patients in rural Tennessee, WV, etc. to have worse outcomes than up in NY, because the lifestyle in those areas is more sedentary and large portions of diabetics made it all the way to ESRD in those rural areas, which indicates that they were living lives that are less healthy. These worse outcomes result(ed) in a significantly lower reimbursement rate for rural hospitals than ones like Montefiore.

None of this takes into account the private insurance market, where these facilities have a harder time negotiating than urban hospitals. For example, people in southern, central Kentucky usually drive to Nashville for planned care. This means that these urban hospitals are in a stronger position at the negotiating table than rural ones.

6766,TeamDJ,"Who here thinks Governor Lee should mandate closing all non-essential business in TN (some form of ‚Äúshelter-in-place‚Äù) to help flatten the curve &amp; reduce the initial wave of transmission to ease the impending strain on hospitals?

If you think it's a good idea to go ahead and close all non-essential businesses in Tennessee, here is a link to contact Gov Bill Lee and express this. If enough folks contact him, it may help make a difference:

https://www.tn.gov/governor/contact-us.html

Shelter in place does not necessarily mean you'd be stuck at home indefinitely - If we modeled Kentucky, for example, all we need to do is close all non-essential businesses... you can still leave your home to exercise and perform essential tasks - groceries, bank, etc. By closing all non-essential businesses (and limiting or banning group gatherings) we would remove the ""reason"" to go out in the first place ‚Äì there‚Äôd be no reason to ‚Äúgo out‚Äù. Subsequently less people would come into contact with each other.

Here is an overview of what some cities and states have enacted so far (shelter-in-place and business closure orders):

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/21/coronavirus-lockdown-orders-shelter-place-stay-home-state-list/2891193001/

I think it's only a matter of time before we will HAVE to close businesses - but it's smarter to do it sooner than later, in order to ease the impending strain on our hospitals and health care system - they simply do not have the tools and resources ready to fight this right now (ex. masks, protective equipment, ventilators, etc.). If we can give them a bit more time that would allow them to get the tools and resources they need - 3M, Honeywell, and Tesla are in the process of manufacturing masks... and the FDA is working on possibly approving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, but the manufacture and shipment of these drugs takes time.

Even with ‚Äúshelter-in-place‚Äù (business closure) we will assuredly still have an exponential amount of new cases, community-spread, and folks going to the hospital ‚Äì however, this will help us ‚Äúease into‚Äù the impending crisis, and help reduce the strain on our hospitals. By reducing the strain we can buy time ‚Äì to learn more about how to treat the sick, gather resources (masks, medicine), keep our nurses and doctors healthy &amp; less over-worked, and prevent an overflow in hospitals and a shortage on hospital beds and ventilators. By closing non-essential businesses, we can flatten the curve, save lives, and prevent us from having to make tough choices on who lives or dies.

Reply to this post and let us know what you think about closing non-essential businesses. We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts below ‚Äì and, if you‚Äôre in agreement, please contact Governor Lee.

Bill Lee is deliberately putting lives at risk at this point. 

I appreciate that he is keeping schools closed longer, but he is leaving government offices opened and asking people to come to work in buildings that have confirmed Covid-19 cases. These employees of the state are officially working in hazardous conditions and are being asked to risk their health and the health of their families. 

This is not a time to be taking risks, or making hard decisions after the fact. We need to be calling Gov. Lee's office and imploring him to make the tough call and protect our residents and their families.

Thus, if the local health department tweets their numbers the same day the state posts theirs, then the local numbers will be higher. 

With that being the case, as a news agency, if you bypass the middle-man and go straight to the local health departments for numbers, then they‚Äôll be more up-to-date.

Travel nurses are one option that others have mentioned. This tends to be *really* expensive though - as much as $75/hr per nurse. The other widely suggested option is to pull nurses and physicians out of retirement. I see two big problem with this though. First of all, they‚Äôre likely to be out-of-practice. Secondly, they‚Äôre going to be on the older side, which makes them a high risk group in a high risk environment.

If your uncle were actually having a heart attack, which they could determine through blood work and EKG readings, then it would get done as an emergency surgery. 

The procedure you‚Äôre talking about is what‚Äôs known as an angiogram. Basically, they insert a catheter into an artery in either the leg or wrist, feed a wire up to the heart, and inject contrast dye while taking x-rays to see if there is a blockage. If there is one, then they will use that wire to place a stent, balloon the artery to widen it, or send the patient for open heart surgery if they are unable to do either of those things. This procedure is used in patients who are having heart attacks, as would occur with a complete or near complete blockage of an artery, and as an exploratory procedure in people who aren‚Äôt having heart attacks but may be showing signs of a less severe (non-life threatening) incomplete blockage of an artery. Some of the things that may cause a doctor to perform an exploratory surgery include a failed stress test, frequent chest pain caused by physical activity, and chronically elevated troponin levels (a protein found in the blood when the heart isn‚Äôt getting enough oxygen). 

Unless your uncle is actively having a heart attack, which they would know from other tests, then he will be fine to stay at home and limit his physical activity. On the flip side of that, if he were to have the procedure done, he would be risking contracting a virus that could potential kill him. 

While it isn‚Äôt ideal, it is in the best interest of your uncle‚Äôs health to postpone the surgery. If for any reason he begins to show the signs of a heart attack, then please call 911 or take him to the closest emergency room.

Political promises that sound good but when you try to collect on them they aren't fulfilled happens a lot. 

I can't see the state shutting down liquor stores for several reasons. 
1. **REVENUE!**
2. People aren't allowed to go out to bars and restaurants, are stressed and would throw a fit. 

For those few liquor stores I've seen that have a drive window it would be great for them to go only to that. But most aren't built that way.

I work with Apartment Locators. We help people find apartments in Nashville and surrounding areas. It's a 100% free service since apartments pay us a commission for bringing them new tenants. It doesn't affect the price of your lease nor are there any hidden costs involved.

Yes, I've seen some of the gatherings around watering holes by Walter Hill and some people too close together and sitting on the benches at the dog park, but your feeling is too over the top in general.

**Any** people going outside their dwellings are selfish and instrumental in the spread and equivalent to spring breakers? That's absurd. During this time people can't go to their jobs and other businesses they may spend time and money at, so they're taking this opportunity to not stare at their own four walls for weeks on end but taking breaks to go out in nature, THE safest, less dense area they can spend time at that's not their homes. It's good for mental health of spending time in nature and seeing other people about at safe distances.

Yes, people do really need to go find somewhere else if they see a greenway parking lot is packed and follow standard distancing and touching etiquette, but shaming people for leaving their plague quarters for the outdoors in general is just not it chief.",1585515738,flv3qi7

In comparison South Korea has the 53rd highest rate of elderly in the world. And there numbers are considerably lower. But they also had more early prevention. 

But people over 60 are far more likely to be hospitalized or die. Over 90% of the deaths in Italy are to people 70 and older. 

So far the United States has a mortality rate that is a fraction of that of Italy and it is because of demographics and lifestyles.

8238,Captain_Cowboy,"[The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm#T1_down) pegs hospitalization rate at around 20.7-31.4% for all age groups, based on 2449 known cases between Feb 12 and Mar 16. You might hope that's just because it's so high for those &gt;=85, but their largest cohort is 20-44 year olds, for which they put the rate between 14.3%-20.8%. That number is most likely high due to lack of testing of the general population, but 15-20% is in-line with estimates from other countries. 

When you combine this with the fact that those who are hospitalized [tend to stay for around 2 weeks](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus#time-from-hospitalization-to-discharge), it's easy to see why letting it go uncontrolled is such a disaster. 

Here's a table of countries that have at least 700 cases with at least 20% of them closed (dead or recovered). Along with it is the mortality rate relative closed cases and total known cases. This is based on data collected by [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), which aggregates data from various countries' official health reporting sources.

Country | Closed % | Closed Mortality | Total Mortality 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
China | 97.35% | 4.16% | 4.05% 
S. Korea | 56.92% | 2.91% | 1.66% 
Bahrain | 52.73% | 1.34% | 0.71% 
Peru | 39.81% | 7.08% | 2.82% 
Iran | 39.35% | 16.51% | 6.50%
Iraq | 31.70% | 22.73% | 7.20%
Spain | 28.90% | 30.53% | 8.82% 
Egypt | 28.59% | 22.66% | 6.48% 
Italy | 26.62% | 44.14% | 11.75% 
Singapore | 26.24% | 1.23% | 0.32% 
Argentina | 25.33% | 10.11% | 2.56% 
France | 24.88% | 27.17% | 6.76% 
Germany | 23.50% | 4.59% | 1.08% 
Japan | 21.98% | 13.47% | 2.96% 
Thailand | 21.32% | 2.84% | 0.61% 
Malaysia | 20.97% | 7.41% | 1.55% 

The huge gap between closed and total mortality is because people who die tend to do so early, so when there are a lot of open cases, closed mortality is likely to be high while total mortality is likely to be low. The final mortality rate (of known cases) is likely to be somewhere between. The higher the Closed % and the closer the two percentages, the more likely the final rate will be equal to the Closed Mortality.

You can see that some countries have very high rates for both values while others have relatively low rates for both. The difference is partially due to testing; countries with more testing catch more cases and just have lower rates -- but they also tend to have lower ""closed %"", which excludes them from this table. I contend that the difference is a direct result of whether or not their hospital systems have been overwhelmed. Additionally, countries with low rates tended to implement widespread testing and comprehensive contact tracing, allowing them to keep the total numbers low (but again, the table above represents at least 700 cases), so they were able to close more cases earlier with better overall outcomes.",1585765745,fm53o38

8256,PyroDesu,"First of all, thank you. This is the kind of discussion I believe is needed. And I'm happy to have that CDC source.

From the looks of the data, the 20-44 cohort is actually pulling the overall hospitalization rate *down* (for that matter, despite its smaller size, the 0-19 cohort may actually be pulling it down even more because of the very low rate of hospitalization - averages are dangerous like that). They are the largest cohort in hospitals, but that is probably because they're the cohort with the highest infection rate - from the lower hospitalization rate. And *every* cohort above them has a higher rate. It's not high because of the &gt;85 cohort, it's high because of the **&gt;45** combined cohorts.

Also, I can't help but notice that these cohorts are skewed a bit - you have a cohort composed of 0-19 year olds (a 20 year span), a cohort of 20-44 year olds (a 25 year span), and from there the data settles into regular 10 year spans until the 85+ year old cohort. Now, I'd normally assume there's good reasoning behind this (though it may just be a common statistical bracketing). But I *would* like if someone were to create a dataset where the cohorts had equal spans - say, 5 year spans, for decent granularity. Unfortunately, I don't know anyone with raw data, nor do I have such myself - so I doubt that wish would be fulfilled.

As it is, going solely by hospitalization rates, I would conjecture that those cohorts are poorly divided. Look at the hospitalization rate of the 45-54 and 55-64 cohorts - they're *very* close and could probably be combined (again, we're just looking at the hospitalization rate - I see the mortality rate is quite different). I'd also say the upper end of the 20-44 cohort is possibly dragging it up, and that cohort should be split. There's a few other examples, but I think you get my point.

And no matter what, I won't argue against the statement that letting it go uncontrolled would be disastrous. Mostly this is statistical nitpicking, the overall conclusion is sound.

As for your other data, I'm more interested in the total mortality percentage expressed. It's the mortality rate of the closed cases, rather than mortality rate of the total population (to take Italy as an example, 44.14% (the closed mortality rate) of 26.62% (the closed cases rate) is 11.75 - which is what is labeled here as the total mortality rate). *That*, I think, shows the real indicator of whether a country's healthcare system was overwhelmed - Italy especially was overwhelmed (that was major news). If that is the case, it appears several other countries have been overwhelmed (for the sake of argument, let's say &gt;6% total mortality)  - Spain, Iraq, France, Iran, Egypt. China is an interesting case, as I recall that they were initially overwhelmed but were able to rapidly create additional capacity, which is probably why their total mortality percentage is between that of the overwhelmed and not overwhelmed groups. Also of interest to me are those countries with especially *low* total mortality rates - Bahrain, Singapore, and Thailand. All of those are &lt;1% (and Germany is also an anomaly, being just above 1%), while most countries (that we're assuming were not overwhelmed) are closer to 3%. What's going on there, I have to wonder.",1585775642,fm5mbus

you attacking preventing measures. Like you shouldnt tell people to wash their hands bc its going to give a false sense of security to people. No, the most Americans are pretty reasonable ( unlike you ). They are going to understand the severity of the situation. Yes, you are going to have some truthers but there is a reason we do preventive measures bc they work. 

Again, yes, bandana if there is nothing else, which implies if there was something else, it would be better aka a mask. 

No, thats not what im saying about the video. most people do not have the gear to do that sort of testing. But that is if you need the mask to absolutely work. the doctors are in extremely dangerous. Alot of the critical covid patients are put on mechanical invasive ventalitors as oppose to non invasive ventalitors. the invasive ventalitors you literally gotta get it down the patients throat. So, its very possible for the patient's spit and fluids to get on the doctor. so it need the mask to work as properly as possible. now for the average people, who isnt going to be doing those procedures, the n95 mask not fit tested is definitely better than nothing. 

So, just stop dude. its spreading like a mother fucker. At our hospitals we are overwhelmed. we are completely out of supplies. Our doctors are only given 1 mask a day. Let alone all the  people who work to make a hospital work, the PCAs, the transport people, techs, environmental people.

We were using the park while practicing good social distance. How do we spread the virus when we have not come closer than 50 feet to the nearest person at that place?

We take every precaution. We do not use the playground - just the soccer pitch and sometimes the track (when there is no one else on it). We wash our hands before and after entering the park. We bring our own water and remove any trash we generate. I use my clinical training to assess the risk and use my parenting focus to balance it against my child's needs. 

I do not need to defend my practices to you. However, it is important to note that social distancing only works if it is nuanced.

In general, the Research Service said the power to take quarantine measures is reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment. In 1824, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall‚Äôs opinion in Gibbons v. Ogden drew a clear line between the federal government and the state governments when it came to regulating activities within and between states.

&gt;Marshall‚Äôs reasoning set the precedent that police powers are reserved to states for activities within their borders (with some exceptions). Those police powers include the ability to impose isolation and quarantine conditions. Marshall wrote that quarantine laws ‚Äúform a portion of that immense mass of legislation which embraces everything within the territory of a State not surrendered to the General Government.‚Äù

* Weak minimum wage laws, especially for tipped employees are the result of [white employers expecting former slaves to work for free.](https://time.com/5404475/history-tipping-american-restaurants-civil-war/)  
* Whites loved unions, until they started admitting black people and applying the same seniority rules as for whites.

8693,AgathaCrispy,"Edit: this turned into a wall of text, but I tried to be thorough. 

Forgive me if you've already done any of this, but it's easier to start from the beginning. I don't work with unemployment, but I know a bit about the process. 

On the Jobs4tn.gov website, you need to register, and under the unemployment benefits tab, click 'file a claim' and then follow the prompts to complete. There may not be a place for you to upload your tax info yet... Until yesterday, self employed individuals have not been eligible for unemployment insurance benefits unless they'd been paying into the system. This changed with the federal gov. action, but the state website isn't necessarily set up to reflect that change. With all the claims being filed, it would be impossible to take it down to do that right now.

So, you will need to continue on through the claim process, providing whatever information is required until it is completed, and submit. At that point, you've done all you need to for now. Since no income information is provided (it is usually the employers responsibility to provide that), you will be contacted via mail asking you to provide the required income verification documents. You'll be given instructions on how to do that securely. At that point, they'll be able to look at that information and make a benefit determination and begin issuing your benefit payment. 

To possibly skip that wait for a letter to arrive: After you've completed your initial claim, you can try going to the tn.gov site and going to the 'help' tab. That will take you to a page with a form you can fill out. On the categories section, select 'unemployment/1099'. In the comment section, put in something about being self employed and needing to provide your income information. Submitting that will send their staff a message, and they should be able to contact you directly to get your info. They are swamped right now, but it'll hopefully be quicker. 


Now, this may not go as quickly as people would like, but this is how the unemployment system in TN operates. In the case of the self employed, the feds basically made changes on the fly and left it to the states to implement, so you're going to be in line with everyone else who is filing right now. The website will probably work slowly because of that, but at least it is working. There may be delays in getting initial payments out, but you'll get the full amount coming to you eventually. 

Usually, there's about a 2 week delay from claims being filed to payments being sent out. In the current situation, it may take longer, but the faster they get all your info, the quicker you'll get your money.

Good luck! If I can help you further, let me know and I'll do what I can.",1585936161,fmbzn9n

It should be open, both the southern and northern segments. The Spur connects Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. All other park areas are closed.

8773,Whatsluvgottodo17,"Hopefully not. Our current government bureaucracy has made a decisive gamble that they could keep people working as long as they did up to and including now. I‚Äôll just say that specifically Governor Lee down to our wrestlin mayor here in Knoxville, and the carnival barker and co have cast a gigantic die due to their incompetence. The question is, are we going to going to be the next Italy? Spain? New York? Current projections have the deaths at 2.5k-4k by the end of the month. They think that during our peak we will need another 2300 hospital beds/ventilators just to keep people alive.

But I have a plan. Hear me out.

Our blue next door neighbors to the North have taken a different tact on this crisis. Frankly, they‚Äôve got their shit together. They enjoy a non-moron governor (some day) that acted earlier than ours. This means that they have both a more gentle slope for their covid peak, and they also happen to have more hospital beds per capita. You can thank our reps for not supporting rural hospitals, but that‚Äôs an aside. 

So here‚Äôs my pitch. We fucking go take them. With utter fucking kindness, gratitude and cold hard cash. Fuck balancing the TN budget this year. Let‚Äôs spend beaucoup bucks to save 2500+ Tennessean‚Äôs lives. That is, if church-going-people, the elderly, and people too stupid to follow the cdc guidelines because it‚Äôs a deep state/liberal conspiracy are groups this administration cares about. I even have a way to pay for it all. 2500 ventilators is, let‚Äôs say, 50000 a piece. That‚Äôs a cool 125 mill. Let‚Äôs double it. Alright here is the pitch:

We borrow the 250 mill and pay off the Kentuckians. They get a fat paycheck, probably some new social program (yuck!) and we get not so many dead Tennesseans due to our incompetent leadership feds and state. It‚Äôs win-win. Then... We legalize recreational marijuana across the state effective next year followed by our legislators working overtime to craft a regulatory system for it based on best practices and then we hit the ground running in 2021. Colorado made 65 mill in taxes the first year they legalized recreational. Nearly double the next year. Suficce to say, pot‚Äôs pretty popular. I‚Äôd be willing to bet that there‚Äôs a repressed market for legalized weed in the southeast. Plus, as it is, marijuana is Tennessee‚Äôs number one (untaxed) cash crop. So let‚Äôs use that for good instead of shipping our tax dollars out of state and/or country. 

Anyway, after that debt has been paid and our books are balanced then we talk about what we learned from the experience of having to sell our soul to the green devil to save old people because our representatives generally are incompetent morons who didn‚Äôt realize that viruses exist and can spread (really, Kemp?), and (of course) look at the effects legalization on communities, etc. and decide if we want to continue with fully legal pot or just medical. Plus, an added bonus, let people out of jail who are only pot offenders (another tax saving).

Or we don‚Äôt do anything and let thousands of Tennesseans die. If that one happens my only request is for you to remember in November who in our state sat on their strikingly orange, ex-wrastlin‚Äô and in the governors case, aw shucks good ole farmhand I don‚Äôt do no sciencin just manual labor for Jesus on my farm hands. His ads‚Äî crazy stuff. But I digress.

You‚Äôre also trying to argue that the response to H1N1 and COVID-19 should be the same. H1N1 was a strain of the flu that many older Americans didn‚Äôt get because of partial immunity that had its origin in Mexico.  It also responded well to anti viral drugs. It‚Äôs mortality rate was 0.001-0.007%. Johns Hopkins also estimated the mortality rate of covid to be 1.2% in the US. Covid is also easier to transmit than H1N1 and there is no (partial or otherwise) immunity for anyone, at any age, and doesn‚Äôt respond to anti virals.

Trump, on the other hand, started with ‚Äúwe have it totally under control [...] it‚Äôs one person‚Äù (Jan 22) and declared a national emergency on Mar 13. Going back to your original argument, H1N1 appeared in the US in April 2009. Obama issued a national health emergency that same month, months before it was classified a pandemic . Again, H1N1‚Äôs response cannot be compared apples to apples due to the nature of how different the two viruses are. 

Republicans go to seems to always be ‚Äúbut Obama‚Äù, like that has any bearing on the pandemic today. 63M people had H1N1 that resulted in 12,000 deaths over the span of basically a year. Covid, that has been in the states for approximately three months has infected ~240,000 and resulted in ~5,400 deaths and hasn‚Äôt peaked yet.

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,

And spills the upper boulders in the sun;

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

The work of hunters is another thing:

I have come after them and made repair

Where they have left not one stone on a stone,

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,

To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,

No one has seen them made or heard them made,

But at spring mending-time we find them there.

I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;

And on a day we meet to walk the line

And set the wall between us once again.

We keep the wall between us as we go.

To each the boulders that have fallen to each.

And some are loaves and some so nearly balls

We have to use a spell to make them balance:

‚ÄòStay where you are until our backs are turned!‚Äô

We wear our fingers rough with handling them.

Oh, just another kind of out-door game,

One on a side. It comes to little more:

There where it is we do not need the wall:

He is all pine and I am apple orchard.

My apple trees will never get across

And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.

He only says, ‚ÄòGood fences make good neighbors.‚Äô

Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder

If I could put a notion in his head:

‚ÄòWhy do they make good neighbors? Isn't it

Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.

Before I built a wall I'd ask to know

What I was walling in or walling out,

And to whom I was like to give offense.

Something there is that doesn't love a wall,

That wants it down.‚Äô I could say ‚ÄòElves‚Äô to him,

But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather

He said it for himself. I see him there

Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top

In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.

He moves in darkness as it seems to me,

Not of woods only and the shade of trees.

He will not go behind his father's saying,

And he likes having thought of it so well

He says again, ‚ÄòGood fences make good neighbors.‚Äô

My husband and I just moved from Lacey, WA to Clarksville TN and we are trying to decide between Chattanooga and Knoxville for our next chapter too so I‚Äôm curious to see what ‚Äúreal Tennesseeans‚Äù have to say to compare the two.",1586192329,fmlsc98

My little sis is a nurse and she's spending her days off sewing cloth face masks not just for family but because that's what they are wearing at work! Which is nuts because those only protect other people from you not the other way around. And fortunately they only have like 50 known patients so far.

9067,drkodos,"If you are into outdoor activities then Chattanooga is the clear choice.

World class rock climbing at multiple locations, excellent water sports, hand gliding off Lookout Mountain, closer to national forests like the Cohutta. One of the best Rock Climbing gyms in the nation.  Tons of trails very close to the city itself, including Stringer's Ridge.  Some of the very best Mountain Biking in the nation close by.

Also, excellent breweries, a thriving and growing music scene, more and better art museums, a fully developed riverfront including one of the best river trails in the nation.

Outdoor magazine voted Chattanooga best city to live in not once but twice.

But also, Chattanooga is located in a temperate rain forest and sees a lot of rain and high humidity.  

Knoxville is larger and likely has more employment opportunities.  Also, it is closer to a National Park.  Regarding demographics Knoxville it is quite a bit whiter (76% vs 58% in Chatt) and skews very conservative and Christian.  Chattanooga is a bit 'bluer' but also has enough churches to qualify as seriously religious and also has the fastest internet in the country (EPB Fiber Optic).",1586194746,fmlwzkn
