Uncle Bill's, the most well-loved (and hated) 24 spot, welcomes all New Years Eve and Day with regular hours.

There will be a fully staffed house tonight, ready to guide you to St. Louis's Smallest Women's Bathroom. 

5 servers, all of vastly different personalities and styles, equally capable of dishing sass and sweetness. Some more jaded, some hard of hearing (sorry she yells at all of us).

Yes, it's a crude bunch, but the humblest and most friendly people with a little respect. It's a real struggle finding a more homey restaurant (right down to the wood paneling).

We'll do our best for every one of you bastards, just remember to be mindful that we, too, are humans. And we wish were drunk with you. 

It's business time:

There is a cocktail on our neon but Uncle Bill's hasn't served alcohol since LBJ. Uncle Bill's has no license and having alcohol in the restaurant will get us fucked so please, remember to drink your beers in the car when you're out smoking (y'all smell like a dispensary, it's cool).

There will be 15% auto-gratuity on all checks, as is usual for 10pm-7am. These ladies (and Matt) do work for tips but if your service sucked, let us know! If your service ruled, let us know! That business card-lookin thing on your table is a comment card - we do read them!

Patience with us please! First come, first seated except no partial parties will be sat during busy times. We will do everything we can to keep groups together but it does get tight.

Uncle Bill's does not have music and it will get ((L O U D )). 

** Hateful behavior towards fellow customers (and staff) is NOT tolerated. ** Malicious vulgarity will get you politely, yet firmly, directed elsewhere. **

Finally PLEASE do NOT drive drunk! Uncle Bill's has 2 phones, we can call a cab -- there is no pride in going through a windshield, yah dingus!!

Uncle Bill's loves you -- yes, you! Happy New Year's Eve, babes! Eat more pancakes 2020!

xoxo",StLouis,Happy NYE - Love Uncle Bill's

We've found some good potential places, but all of them have either been renovated/flipped or are in need of a remodel. 

With a large amount of equity in our current home, we'd have money to buy a rough-around-the-edges place and have funds to improve it to OUR liking - not a flipper's choices. I'm looking for something like an **all in one solution** that helps you find a property (realtor) and will work with you and your budget to plan the renovation and remodel of the property (contractor) prior to move in. 

Are there Realty companies like this in STL or is this something that isn't really a thing? The benefit for us would be dealing with 1 entity rather than 5-10 different contractors for various jobs and turning this potential move into a shit show.

I have a little time to offer rides to Collinsville a couple times in the next week or two. I can only give rides back to people who only get CBD because otherwise that would be illegal and we would never do anything illegal. I'm not going to search you or ask you a bunch of questions. In fact there really would be nothing stopping you from just not telling me about it. So please don't do that because I like to obey all the laws all the time. Even the laws that make 0 sense and are obviously in place to get us hooked on opiates, I like to obey them all the time too. 

This is a free service but tips will be welcome. I'll just wait until 2 or 3 people want to go and then I'll pick everyone up and take you all over there. I have hand warmers and coats if anyone needs them for the line. 

Again- I obey all 100,000+ laws in this great free country at all times. No thc will be allowed in my car at any time.",StLouis,Rides To Collinsville &amp; Protest Tonight

I was at a Sacramento Kings game in Sacramento this week. I saw security identify a man in a St. Louis Cardinals hat, and ask him if he was a Cardinals fan(as a law enforcement officer I was expecting him to say, “No, I just bang.”) The man told him, “I am from St. Louis.” The security guard lit up and then the man lit up, he knew what was coming. The security guard yelled, “Me too! Where are you from?”  He completely forgot that he was doing crowd control. They both looked like family being reunited. They both approached each other and were clearly happy to have met each other.

It was hella cool to see.  It made me want to act like that. To show real emotion towards a stranger. 

California can be less than welcoming to its residents, and seeing that interaction made me miss the warmth that people have for strangers outside of here. We talk at strangers here, but we don’t actually want them to say more than the standard response. We are polite/nice even if we hate you.  Many of us here think everyone’s who is 1% more passive than us is weak, and everyone who is 1% more aggressive is controlling.  We tend to assume the worst intentions for bad situations.

Moved here last year. I recently start doing more research into the different neighborhoods as I am thinking of buying after my lease concludes in spring.

As I read through old Reddit posts, and real estate ads, walkability seems emphasized a lot and I am wondering what people/you consider the main attraction with that is.

I am renting in downtown right now. I suppose it is fairly walkable, a small dog park is right near by and Culinaria is with-in 10 mins walk. But almost a year in I am not sure I am getting it. 

When I buy groceries, I find a Costco run more convenient, load up everything in the trunk and goes straight into the parking lot instead of carrying a handful of heavy bags walking in summer heat/winter cold (+ more limited selection) 

I go to CWE and South Grand ave for restaurants often, and Soulard for going for drinks, the Grove sometimes for dance clubs, mostly drive, Metrolink for CWE/the Grove occasionally.

Don't get me wrong, of course I see the benefit of a walkable commercial strip of restaurants and store, but what is people looking for in a residential context?",StLouis,"When people talk about walkability, what do they have in mind?"

Hello!

I live in West County STL and would love to start up/join an existing group, to play DnD 5e with! I'm semi-experienced with 5e having been in one previous group that fell apart about a month ago. I've listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts, made maybe a few too many characters in my spare time, and I'm starting my own dice horde!

I would love to get back into a campaign (I'm not looking for organized play really) and have some fun adventures with other like minded individuals. Other than that I'm not too picky :)

Currently with my work I am scheduled off on Thursdays every week for class so that's my best day to play, or as long we have a set day every week to play my work can work around it for me.

I look forward to hearing from you guys, so far I have interest from one other player, looking for a DM and at least 2 other players!",StLouis,Dungeons and Dragons?

I'm really enjoying St. Louis and all it has to offer, but one aspect of the move that had me excited was that I could finally escape those horrible, awful, irritating ""It's a crime to pay more than a dime"" Jeremy Franklin Mitsubishi auto dealership ads that play in Kansas City.  

I'd be shocked if these horrendous commercials haven't been discussed ad nauseum on this subreddit, because, honestly, how could they not be -- but can you imagine my dismay upon hearing a Frank Leta commercial for the first time in St. Louis? The second time? The third? 

Somehow, some way, the Frank Leta ads are even worse than Jeremy Franklin's. Maybe it's because my resentment for these ads been compounded by my disappointment, maybe it's because there's more than one Frank Leta location, and maybe it's because I've never heard anything worse than Frank Leta's Halloween versions of the ad featuring Frankenstein. 

I've since learned that these ads are in quite a few metros across the nation. 

I know that the point of advertising is for you to remember the product, and I'd be lying to you if I told you I could remember many other dealership jingles or commercials, but for as long as I live, I will never buy a car from Frank Leta or Jeremy Franklin, or anybody else that tells me it's a crime to pay more than a dime.",StLouis,Frank Leta radio ads are the absolute worst

Gooey butter cake
Toasted ravioli
St. Paul sandwich (/egg foo young sandwich)
St. Louis-style fried rice (fried with dark soy sauce; mundane perhaps, but still counts)
St. Louis-style pizza
Slinger
Brain sandwich
BBQ St. Louis-style spare ribs
BBQ pork steak
BBQ pork snout
frozen concrete
Gerber sandwich
Hot salami sandwich (Gioia's Deli etc.; this seems distinct from generic salami sandwiches)
specialty flavor kolaches from St. Louis Kolache (Pappy's BBQ, Gioia's Deli, ""St. Louis Pizza"", Meatball Provel)
stick pretzel (Gus's Pretzels; not sure if they were the first to make a pretzel in a stick shape like this, but I'm gonna eat it anyway)

Since Provel is a unique St. Louis food product, dishes that use Provel as a twist would also count (this ought to be a big category). Fusion dishes incorporating St. Louis characteristics into other cuisines also count for the purposes of this list (like, if someone made burritos with Provel or gooey butter baklava or something).

If anyone wants to know about what the unique local dishes are in the other cities I've done extensive food crawls in, here's my Instagram handle (currently in the process of posting SF/Bay Area local eats):

Or ask in the comments and I'm happy to answer :) Thanks in advance for your suggestions!",StLouis,Visiting St. Louis &amp; making a comprehensive list of all local St. Louis dishes to try; did I miss any?
519,519,PinstripeMonkey,1579139887,epce2s,Nan,"TL;DR below.

Basically the title - as early Spring approaches, I'm looking for scenic and secluded dispersed camping spots in the region. I want to be able to pull off of some isolated forest road in a beautiful area and be able to set up a campsite for a few days with little to no contact with other people. Other preferred qualities if possible - nearish proximity to trails and/or swimmable rivers or lakes, and maybe loose proximity to a small town, historic site, cavern, or other unique feature worth integrating into the front or back end of the trip.

I'm slightly spoiled coming from highly rural Colorado and New Mexico where almost everything was public land that allowed dispersed camping on countless miles of forest access roads, and I'm hoping to find the closest thing possible here. I'm avoiding paid campsites AND weekend party spots for local teenagers at all costs.

So let me know if you have any specific or general recommendations! I have a sleeping platform in my vehicle and can handle light off roading. I'm not opposed to hiking in, but for now I'm looking mainly for vehicle accessible spots to introduce my gf to camping. 

TL;DR please recommend dispersed camping spots within a few hours of STL.",StLouis,Recommendations for dispersed camping spots in the region as Spring approaches?

Is there a site to sell items that doesn’t require social media? (I got rid of all of mine years ago) I know everyone used to use craigslist, but is that still a thing since FB garage sales and such? 

Is there a church or something I can take items to instead of Salvation Army or Goodwill?

::::::::::

The details:

* **Who**? Through this project it's become clear to me everyone shares a balance of commonality &amp; individuality. I learn more from strangers different from me. I'm a white, liberal, middle class male who's from the Midwest. In recent years I looked for strangers with different ideologies than my own. This year, I'm particularly looking for someone who's racial background is different than mine. This is not an attempt to tokenize anyone or have one person of color represent their entire race, but just a way to broaden my understanding &amp; tell a different kind of story.
* **What**? Dinner at a restaurant, in public, of your choosing. Bill's on me.
* **Where**? We pick a place you like that's located conveniently for both of us.
* **When**? On my birthday (details to be shared after we discuss via PM)
* **Why**? See above!
---
Please feel free to ask Qs here or inbox me. If you are interested please let me know. I respond to **everyone**. I look forward to meeting you.

You may think you don't have an interesting story to tell or that you've lead a boring life *but* my experience is that all personal stories are fascinating &amp; important to tell. I honestly want to meet ***you***.

First of, just finished visiting your city this weekend, beautiful red brick buildings you guys have and that arch thingy. 

I have a question about North City. 

I went there with my pregnant wife, we were in a rental car, and our hosts just told us to take a look at it during the day. As we were rolling there, we came across a dude on the corner just standing and smoking, and I was being silly so I opened my window and nodded at the guy, he nodded back as I kept driving. My wife got mad and said that this is a dangerous thing to do, cuz the area is known for high crime rates. And then we kept driving, there was another guy on another corner and I joked that she should open her window and nod at the nice fella. That made her even more mad and she said that she is reconsidering ""us"" right now (seriously). 

1- So my question is, is north city that dangerous that what I did can get me shot? or is it just a fairly silly thing to do? 

2- Is she overreacting or did I deserve that reaction?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your insight about north city,

 The punk-rock group Green Day performed during NHL’s All Star Weekend game in St. Louis over the weekend amid their recently-announced [**partnership with the league**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2019/09/green-day-announces-partnership-with-nhl-for-next-two-seasons/), but fans who traveled hours to the gig were unaware that the billed concert was only supposed to be a brief set.

The outdoor gig, which was free and open to the public before max capacity was reached, took place on the block of 14th street downtown between Market Street and Clark Avenue. According to *STLToday*, the NHL estimated the crowd at 15,000 before Green Day took the stage at 5:20 p.m. The group came out singing their smash-hit “Know Your Enemy” from 2009’s *21st Century Breakdown* and followed with “Bang Bang,” their successful hit from 2016’s *Revolution Radio*.

“Fire, Ready, Aim” came next, which has been a track geared toward the NHL and serves as the opening theme for *NBCSN’*s “Wednesday Night Hockey.” Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told the crowd that the band needed to redo the song, to bring the energy up a notch, for a broadcast performance of the song.

-Non-smoking (whole complex)

- allows cats (2)
- private washer/dryer hook up

Hey y'all,

Saturday, February 22nd, from 7:30am - 11am, the dental school at 1500 Park Ave is having free dental exams for veterans.  This consists of a panoramic xray and oral exam from faculty and dental students who are volunteering their time on Saturday.  

These exams normally run $116 at our University (and much more than that at a private practice) so getting it free is a great bargain.  If you or someone you know is a veteran in need of dental care, our door is wide open!",StLouis,Free dental exams for Veterans at the dental school! (MOSDOH)

960,960,NovembersDoom6,1580463562,ewm1qp,Nan,"My fiancé, his mother, and I are about to move to Missouri from out of state, as soon as the mobile home we currently live in sells, which could be any minute now. We anticipate getting about $8,000 for it, which will be our whole moving budget.

We're moving so I can find work. I have an MBA. I've been job hunting where we live now for a year to no avail. It's an extremely rural area with very few jobs and no real career opportunities. So we're moving to the St.  Louis area for a fresh start and so I can find work once we get there and start to grow my career. (I just graduated last year.) We've made a couple trips up there and done quite a bit of research. We've settled on the Fenton area. We want to rent a two bedroom apartment once we move there, or possibly a trailer in a trailer park outside of town a little ways. (Or anything, really.)

Here's the nightmarish catch-22. I'm not working and thus have no income, so finding and getting approved for a place to live there could be very hard. Yet I can't get a job there because I don't live there. I can't interview or meet people up there until I'm actually living there. I live seven hours away. 

My fiancé and his mom are disabled. Their disability checks together are about $1,975. But most of the apartments we looked at were over $800 a month. Including the pet fee which we'd have to pay. And most apartments require 3x rent for approval. So it's really a tough situation. Can't get up there and start working and get some income until after moving there and getting a place. Can't move up there and get a place until I start working and getting some income. And with only $8,000 (if even that) to cover the whole move, we can't afford to just pay a whole year up front or rent an Air BnB for three or six months until I get a job and have income. We'd probably blow through all the money before I even got a job and then we'd be homeless. We ideally need to find and get approved for housing immediately after this house sells.

What should we do? How can find and get approved for housing with just their disability income of a little under $2,000? I mean that's something at least, but I suspect that getting approved for any housing will still be very difficult. I'm not worried about being able to pay rent. Within a few months I'm sure I could manage to find some kinda job, anything at all, and then we'd be fine with all three of us making money. And before that happens, we can make due somehow with just their checks. It's just the getting approved for housing before getting the job part that is really scaring me. Is it feasible at all that we could get approved for a two-bedroom housing unit of some sort with under $2,000 in income?",StLouis,"Moving to Fenton, on disability - how to find two-bedroom housing with income under $2,000?"
961,961,BIGJake111,1580476542,ewobej,Nan,"Hey guys, moving to town soon. I’ll be working pretty close to central west end and downtown proper. (Don’t think I want to live there though... maybe). But I’m curious which interstate is the best commute. Also I’m not used to cities having many incorporated cities within their metro, its been hard to look objectively at tax burden in different parts of the county, other counties in the area, and all the individual city limits. Where is a good area to avoid high sales and property tax? My first impression is st Clair. Would this be a wise area to rent in and how is the commute from there to downtown?

Demographic information, I’m young and married. Not looking for night life. If I had to choose between fun, safe, and cheap. I would pick safe each and every time over... but I also don’t care about zip in terms of prestige or if there is crown molding if you know what I mean.

1075,1075,RyleyinSTL,1580790245,eykbn9,Nan,"Anyone who lives in the City knows that 911 can ring busy, sometimes for a long while. The reasons for this, while troubling, disappointing, and infuriating, are not important for the context of my inquiry.

I called 911 Sunday night to report some gunfire and was on hold over 5 mins...so I hung up. I hated to do so, as try to report all gunfire I hear, but it was late and distant so I let it go. This is far from the first time this has happened.

That got me to thinking. What if I was having a more troubling emergency (not that gunfire shouldn't be a HUGE emergency, but alas, here we are)? What if I'd been hit by that gunfire, called 911, and then was on hold for 10mins and passed out before the operator picked up. Then I eventually die hours later only to rot in my home for days and days before my wife gets back from a business trip? That sucks! I pay my taxes, I'd like to avoid rotting in my home for days and days.

This isn't Ladue. If I'm not there when the operator finally answers no one is coming to check that out.

Is there something others are doing when 911 rings busy? How are you logging a record with authorities? An email address? Website?",StLouis,When no one will answer - Alternatives to dialing 911 or police dispatch?

When I asked for UMSL last year, I got rejected due to the extremely low GPA. Even tho the transfer student counselor said I could send an email explaining my situation and they might approve me anyway, it didnt happen.

I need to get back into college and get my CS degree. At university, I did complete freshman and sophomore years, so I didn't really get much work done on my major, but I got a lot of the basic bullshit completed. 

So what colleges around the area will accept me and give me a 2nd chance even tho I haven't been in school for 4 years (but I have been working) and my GPA is horrible (i think it might even be like 1.9 or something)

In desperate to finish my degree, please help me. There has to be a way to get me a 2nd chance.",StLouis,Any colleges that will accept a flunk out with abysmal GPA?

I know in the state of Missouri, you pay the difference less trade in for the sales tax percentage. Ex: Buy a car for 30K, trade in is 10K, so only pay sales tax on the 20K difference.

We sold our car to Carvana this week, and yesterday purchased a car in a private sale from a family member. I’ve always traded in my vehicle and purchased a new car in the same transaction, so this is new to me. 

From my research, it looks like this rule applies even if it’s done in separate transactions, but I’ve only found info on dealership to dealership.

So, even in this unique situation, will we only pay the difference? Or do we have to pay the sales tax on the full amount we paid in private sale?",StLouis,Vehicle Sales Tax Credit: Carvana/Private Seller

1217,1217,NovembersDoom6,1581193113,f0x2gc,Nan,"My family and I are moving to the St. Louis area from out of state. We just sold our house and will be up there by Monday looking for a two-bedroom apartment (or maybe mobile home if necessary) to rent. We have about a week and a half left to be out of this house. My fiancé thinks we'll be able to go up there and find and get approved for a place in just a two or three days, with us having only about $2,000 in income and his mother having bad credit and collections on her record.

I know realistically it could take weeks, so we may have to keep our stuff in storage and live in a hotel for a couple weeks until we do find a place. If we have to, we will, but we're still hoping to get approved for something affordable and in a fairly safe area no later than the end of this upcoming week.

Given our income, I'm thinking we wouldn't even have a shot at getting approved for something over $750 (including a pet fee, which at most apartments is around $50). So something starting in the $600 range may be our only option. We have been looking in the Mehlville area and surrounding areas, as well as areas near Arnold, Imperial, and High Ridge, but we honestly don't know where else we should be looking for something safe and affordable given our circumstances. I honestly think we may have a better shot getting into a mobile home in a more rural area, but my fiancé really prefers an apartment.

Any advice or tips on apartment hunting on this low budget is appreciated. I will get a job once we move up there, and then income won't be an issue, but I don't have one already lined up there, hence why our income is so limited. We just have their SSI and SSDI checks until I start working. We need to get approved and moved in somewhere before I can even start job hunting.",StLouis,"Areas to look for a two-bedroom apartment under $750, preferably under $700?"

I am forever caught in this ""you need experience to get experience, you have to know them before you know them, you have to have the job before you get the interview"" catch 22.  Everyone seems to be able to get around it, but I can't.  I fire off hundreds of resumes, talk to recruiters, whatever.  No bites. Everyone wants someone senior that they can pay as little as an intern.

I took a coding boot camp and loved it.  But I have been let down so many times and gotten so many half answers and spent so much money with nothing to show for it that I am about to give up.  My last shot is LaunchCode, but it is impossible to get in.

Therefore, I'll take anything in any field.

I'll send a resume to anyone who asks, but here it is in short:

BA Ancient History, University of Iowa
Writing Certificate, UMSL
4 years experience in medical records
1 year experience in office management.
Able to intern in the afternoons.

The reason I am looking for work is because I have no opportunity for growth, don't make enough money (25k annual) and I'm tired of working for my dad.

We need to look into changing our Cell phone and TV providers.  We've been with Sprint and Charter for so long now that they are just gouging us on their prices, and not offering any discounts.  It's gotten ridiculous!  So it's time to probably move on, at least for 6 months or so, in order to get some better rates.

So I'm just looking for recommendations.  We're talking 4 cell phone lines, looking for unlimited voice/text and preferably some generous data plans.  

For TV we'd prefer a whole-home DVR system, don't really need premium channels but would like the NHL channel, Fox Sports Midwest, and all the regular stuff (gotta have the local network affiliates).  If a plan includes Netflix and/or Amazon Prime, that'd be a bonus!

We will most likely keep the Charter Internet that we currently have, unless something like Google Fiber is now available here.

So if anyone has gotten good deals and can recommend, I'd appreciate it!",StLouis,Looking for cell phone and TV provider recommendations

Our ETA is around Spring 2021, but is flexible depending on obtaining jobs. We are in the early days of our search and are planning to rent in STL for a year or less while house hunting. I have a few questions and I would love to hear from locals!

1) We are a young couple and are planning to start a family soon, but want to live in the city/walkable to bars/coffee shops so we are looking for kid friendly/walkable neighborhoods. We're looking at areas like Tower Grove South/East, Shaw, and Central West End. (These are our top areas to eventually buy in as well.) Are there other areas we should consider? 

2) When do you think is an appropriate time to start actively applying to jobs/reaching out to agencies/recruiters for the STL area? I would love to start having conversations now, but recognize that we're a ways away.  

3) Is the spring a good time to move in terms of new apartment leases? 

4) What are some ways to meet other young couples/find fun things to do in the city? We absolutely love NYC, but are excited to settle down in STL next year! 

5) Anything else we should keep in mind for making the big move?

On offer up there was an item I wanted to buy, it wasn't too cheap of a price for what the item was going for in other listings, but it was cheaper. So I agree to meet with the seller who apparently was ""without a car"", no big deal have bought plenty of things from people's houses without an issue, I actually prefer seeing the item in person to verify it works and looks good. 

I agree to meet when he was available which happened to be 8 on friday night. I drive to the apartment complex and couldn't find his number so I parked in spots that I saw that was generally close to his according to the numbers. I let him know i was here and couldn't find his place which i think benefited me, because he was kind of upset I didnt park in front of his building for whatever reason.  Anyway he says he will be right out and I wait for him to come out.

I finally see him carrying a suitcase(which it should have been in the box it came in) and as i approach him he says you got the money without showing me the item first, I said yeah sure let me see it. Knowing the area I was in I was armed, and had my weapon in my pocket, I also vape so when I asked to see it, I had the vape in my hand and put it in the pocket with the weapon and it made a clink sound.He starts to open the suitcase and says he forgot something and had to go back inside to get it. 

As soon as he goes back inside I start noticing a few other people have came outside and are scouting the area seeing what I was going to do. I got the feeling I was going to be robbed so I immediately started walking back to my car and leave. He messages me in a few minutes on the way home saying he has been robbed before and that's why he asked for the money first, and that he wasn't trying to do anything but sell the item. That if I came back he would knock 25 bucks off for ""doing some dumb shit"" 

Yeah ok, he was afraid of getting robbed by a white guy in Ferguson at 8 o'clock at night. The amount of money was nothing significant, definitely not worth going to jail over. But I got the feeling he felt it was worth it. I told him I would meet Saturday in the daytime at a public place that was very close to his address and he would not do it, said he didnt have a car. I left it at someone else with get it I'm good. 

I could go to offerup and tell them what he planned but he would just make another account and do it anyway. As stated in the beginning yes I know it was not the smartest thing to do but I tried to give someone the benefit of the doubt and almost paid for it. Luckily nothing happened but I do know what could have happened. Ferguson hasn't healed. Be careful on offerup!!!!!!",StLouis,Ferguson hasn't healed yet....

I got a parking ticket (downtown) for parking within 10ft of a mailbox. First of all, I didn't know you couldn't park in front of a mailbox. Is that common knowledge? It's not listed in the Missouri driver’s manual (I checked), so I'm not sure how one is supposed to know that. The only signs in the area have a time limit on parking between certain hours, I was outside of those hours. There was no meter. 

Upon revisiting the area today, I realized the curb in front of the mailbox was yellow, however very faded. I hadn't noticed it when I parked there.

My real question is whether anybody's had any luck contesting due to faded paint? I don't want to waste my time at a hearing over $25 and my own stubbornness.",StLouis,Contesting parking ticket (mailbox/yellow curb)

I had a mini freak out moment today buying tickets for the Rolling Stones during the American Express Pre-Sale and ended up buying 4 when we only need 2. The total value, after taxes and fees, was $359.40 for section 434, Row GG, Seats 7&amp;8. I'd like to break even and sell each for $180. 

Looking at these tickets earlier, they were coming up as $540+. Maybe these are the general sale price, I'm not sure. There's a STL Today article saying that tickets are between $66.50/each and up to $699, but the prices I'm seeing on this presale are higher - starting with these at the lowest range and the pit tickets at $699. But, do your research and make your own decision. Tickets are through Ticketmaster and can be directly transferred to you. We have Venmo, Paypal, Zelle, and SquareCash as potential payment methods.

But this Thai St. Paul sandwich from Drunken Noodles Taste of Thai was amazing- it's a small hole-in-the-wall place on the southern side of town that serves both Chinese and Thai food. The way they do the egg foo young patty takes cues from the Thai-style omelette (khai jiao), and I asked the server if I could have it spicy and he said he could do it with Thai green chili peppers and basil, which sounded amazing to me. He also offered a little bit of red curry sauce to dip the sandwich in. So this is kinda like ""secret menu"" still, since I assume the local clientele doesn't typically go out of their way to ask for things spicy, but I call it ""Thai St. Paul sandwich"", which indicates pretty clearly what exactly it is. The Thai flavors make the sandwich absolutely amazing; I can't recommend it enough! I love finding hidden gems like this; please support this small family business and request a Thai-style St. Paul! Here is a photo from my instagram of what it looks like:
https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jymbjl6nY/

They also have breaded cashew chicken on the menu, though Springfielders may be disappointed as it didn't look quite like the flour-dredged style that is considered most authentic. But points for effort; maybe if you're a Springfielder you could request the manager to do it ""Springfield-style"" and tell them how you want it; he was quite friendly and accommodating. 

tl;dr: request the Thai-style St. Paul sandwich from Drunken Noodles Taste of Thai. 5496 Baumgartner Rd, St. Louis, MO 63129

Hey all,

I have a 98 4Runner 4wd with 252k miles. It’s been my daily driver for the last 12 years and I absolutely love it. I hope to keep it for another 12 years.

It’s long overdue on maintenance. Dobbs gave me a rundown on what needs replacing and my biggest concern is the axle seals. I’ve pretty much decided to go ahead and put the money into it and get her back in shape. Anyone have an honest mechanic that can take care of the below issues?

I travel often to conferences and just to explore. Short commute, good nightlife, and ability to meet people out and about are high priorities to me as I doubt I'll be making the 45 minute commute back across the river regularly to maintain a social circle.   


Also, please feel free to shoot over apartment recommendations too. I've just began to look and so far only have scheduled a tour with Citizen Park this morning. I'm in the early stages of figuring this out and am really just a clueless Illinoisan.

And regarding transportation, is there public transportation or better to rent a car/use uber?",StLouis,Visiting StLouis
1629,1629,mattrts,1582466759,f89ubg,Nan,"I had family come to town this week who had never really been to St. Louis before. We did all the touristy things from the Arch to downtown St. Charles, but mostly focused on the more local things. On Friday night we went to eat on Wash Ave downtown and took Olive the whole way down. As we were driving down I couldn't stop focusing on all of the empty buildings we were passing and the potholes I kept swerving to avoid, thinking about what a missed opportunity all this was. Then my family members started talking about how much they loved St. Louis, how they really felt a certain positivity around the city, and how exciting it was to see all of the new construction. 

We had a similar experience on Saturday. We spent most of the day in Lone Elk Park and Forest Park. Disclaimer, my family isn't necessarily what you would call outdoorsy or artistic. But what I thought would be a quick drive through Lone Elk Park became a hike. What I thought would be me just pointing out the Art Museum building became a two hour long walk through most of the exhibits. What I thought would be a quick pop into the Zoo became a day long experience that had my family talking about how they wish they could have done stuff like this growing up. Or that they could have taken me to places like this when I was growing up. All of this from family that I had to convince to visit because they knew nothing of St. Louis except for the crime. As an added bonus I learned out that my dad grew up a Stan the Man fan, which I didn't know.

I think living here it's easy to sometimes become complacent. It's easier to focus on seeing what could have been or become demoralized by the senseless killings of children that continue to happen. Then I remember that where I'm, and where most people are, from doesn't have a zoo, or a world class art museum, or a great food scene, or two of the best professional sports teams (make that 3, kaw kaw), or beautiful architecture, or 11 Fortune 500 companies, or world class universities, or amazing parks less than 30 minutes away, or anything really. There's a lot of bad here, but there's even more good. Can't imagine just how great this city can be once we're able to improve the lives of people here who need it the most.",StLouis,We have a great city

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* The unidentified girl was found by two man who entered an abandoned Victorian house in search of a pipe wrench to fix their broken down vehicle. The men noticed the body after lighting a cigarette, which illuminated it; her body was naked except for a yellow sweater, and had been left lying on her stomach, with the hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope.
* She was wearing a yellow, long sleeved V-Neck sweater and two coats of red and purple nail polish. The child's sweater had previously been sent by law enforcement to a psychic in Florida in 2013 who wanted to touch it to receive a psychic impression; however, the sweater was never returned, and presumed to have been lost in the mail.
* There were evidence that she suffered from spina bifida occulta but it is believed she showed no outward symptoms.
* She had not been killed at the house as no traces of blood were found by the body. This led to law enforcement to believe blood had been drained from her body elsewhere; her stomach was also empty at the time of her death.
* She had been raped and decapitated, but the cause of death is believed to be strangulation.
* The Missouri Botanical Garden performed mold tests on her body which determined she had been killed within five days of her discovery.
* The head of the Jane Doe has never been located, preventing dental examination and the possibility of a traditional facial reconstruction.
* Authorities believe she was probably from out of state as they checked school records around Missouri very thoroughly. They conducted a nationwide search, including running ads in every African-American newspaper and magazine in the country and corresponded with every state police agency.
* She was also presumed to have been a victim of Vernon Brown, who had murdered young girls in a similar manner. Brown was executed in 2005 and never confessed to murdering the Jane Doe, despite efforts made by investigators.
* She has also been nicknamed ""Hope"" and the ""Little Jane Doe.""
* Her body was exhumed in 2013. Isotope tests on samples of her bones determined she lived her entire life in one of ten southeastern states: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Tennessee, or North or South Carolina. However, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children catalogue entry alternately lists the midwestern–midatlantic states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, or West Virginia.
* Bryan Alaspa wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Story-St-Louis-Jane-ebook/dp/B07FC49HM6) about her called Hope: The Story of the St. Louis Jane Doe. You can read the first chapter and a bit of the second one on the website above.

&amp;#x200B;

Ruled out: Northampton County Jane Doe (ruled out to be the remaining parts of the body), Sharaun Taree Cole, Sherri Truesdale, Beverly Ward, Yohanna Cyr, Telethia Good, Sherise Magee, Toya Hill, Sheila Quinn, Shaunda Green.

I'm a NYC-area college student strongly considering moving to the Rust Belt, and St. Louis is one of the cities on my list. Low cost of living, nice scenery, and baseball too! I visited St. Louis as a kid and I'll never forget the view from the top of the gateway arch, or the street food I ate as I walked along the riverfront. However, I also know that StL has much higher crime rates than NYC. When I tell my fellow Northeasterners I'm considering moving to St. Louis, they look at me like I've grown a third eye. That being said, I'm a little paranoid that I'd do something stupid and get myself mugged or shot if I lived in a Rust Belt city (the last such city I visited was Chicago, and I stayed in the touristy areas there).

I grew up in the suburbs, and I visit NYC a lot. NYC is one of the safest cities in America, so I'm not really used to sketchy neighborhoods (the Bronx doesn't even compare to places like East Cleveland or South Side Chicago in terms of crime). That being said, I take the necessary precautions anyway: I never leave my belongings unattended in public and I only walk in areas with lots of people. 

I see the crime statistics for St. Louis are pretty high, among the highest in the country. People here in the NYC region compare St. Louis to Detroit or Baltimore and generally have a negative opinion of the Rust Belt (""run-down"", ""cornfields"", etc. although to be fair, they also tend to shit on Philadelphia as well). I was in Baltimore over the summer a few years ago and I heard gunshots overnight a few times, is it like that in St. Louis? Would I still be able to adapt to a city with higher crime rates, like St. Louis? If so, what should I do to keep myself safe?",StLouis,Considering moving to St. Louis; Should I be worried about crime?

I am a recent college grad and have been living at home for the past year following my graduation. I grew up in the suburbs of St. Charles county and my family always instilled this fear of the city. I've worked in the central west end for a year and a half now and my other job takes me all over St. Louis county including the city, north county, and South city. My family wasn't all too excited about me working in the city and they are reacting the same way now when I tell them I'm going to move into the city. 

I can't do the 45 minute commute everyday anymore, but my parents don't want me living in the city. However, I can't afford the areas they want me to move to (Chestefield, main street St.Charles, Wildwood, Creve Coeur, ect.) I only make around $40,000 a year and I'm trying to pay my student loans down, so I want to keep my rent under $800 a month. This puts a limit on where I can live affordably especially since I want to live alone.

What can I do to convince my parents that Shaw/Tower Grove area is safe? Of course it's not going to be as safe as the suburbs, but Shaw isn't as dangerous as other areas of the city. When I told my mom that I was looking at Shaw she said ""I don't know...you're aunt's friend got robbed there 10 years ago"". I've tried telling them that I won't be immune to crime, but I can take precautions like no valuables in my car, carry pepper spray and knife, contact a friend or family member if I'm walking alone somewhere etc, but they are convinced I'm going to die if I live in the city.",StLouis,Safety of Shaw/Tower Grove?

From not knowing the exact number of medical PPE available commercially and in their national stockpile to not testing enough people to severely downplaying every single aspect of the virus. 

Every professional will tell you containment doesn't work which is true. But with any type of pandemic virus that has spread beyond its epicenter you are looking to qwell the peak of its severity. By closing schools, centers of congregation, airports, mass transit and quarantining populations you are saving lives because it attenuates the impact and spreads it across the board far enough where it eventually allows the virus to fizzle out. Assuming Chinas' numbers are correct, they have effectively qwelled the virus and even though they get new cases every day, it is substantially less. However, they took some ballsy draconian measures to get there and the healthcare providers worked like soldiers in a battlefield to treat everyone and test everyone.  

Anyways, i digress. Following the patterns of other major outbreak sites, the percentages of those needed to be hospitalized and in need of ICU are in the 15-20% of those infected which is VERY concerning. This questions the capacity of every hospital in the country, let alone dense urban areas. The fatality rates for the young may be indeed low but no one is exempt from getting hospitalized and needing respiratory support in response to ARDS which is very rapid onset with COVID-19.

All –
 
There was a planning meeting today to prepare for a potential closure of the Chesterfield site; PLEASE NOTE: this was preparatory in nature and not driven by potential exposure.  It was a good session, and some additional information was presented about the Creve Coeur site impact.
 
Creve Coeur Information
No test results are available for the person in question from Creve Coeur. It is unclear how/when people will be notified given the sensitive nature of the information; please remember this information is very private and will be handled as such
They confirmed that anyone who was in contact with the person in question has already been contacted.  IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED, you are not at any higher risk than the general population.
Risk that the R&amp;D side of the campus was exposed is low, which could accelerate the cleaning process a bit
Information continues to develop on the approach for cleaning.  For lab spaces, they are going to steer clear of instrumentation, chemical containers and anything inside of a cabinet; the focus will be on general traffic areas, handles, external parts of cabinets, work spaces and offices
We should consider what, if anything should be done with our instrumentation upon the site re-opening (i.e. is there a need to wipe down anything with disinfecting wipes?)
We don’t know if there will be an option to open the campus in stages (i.e. clean and re-open R&amp;D campus, then clean &amp; re-open east campus, etc.) – we will continue to update the teams as we learn more
A small number of people have been identified for access to the site IF NEEDED; these names have been sent to the Security team and are the ONLY people who will be allowed on site should the need arise. The team leads are aware they need to work through me should additional access be needed
 
For Chesterfield site planning only:
Again, please note this is an exercise in preparation and is NOT being driven by a potential exposure.
By Thursday March 12, we are being asked to provide the following information to the facilities site lead:
Names of people that would need access to either prepare a lab or maintain equipment over an extended outage
Critical tasks (i.e. anything that is critical to the business and would be negatively impacted by a site closure of more than 2 – 3 days)
ACTION:  Team leads with labs in CV (redacted) – please work with your teams to send me the information no later than (redacted)

I'm looking for must see cool spots indicative of what makes St. Louis unique (already seen the arch, so that's crossed off the list). I am using the wiki on here as my guide, but anytime I visit a place I always do post on the subreddit as it yields unique results. 

So where are the 'must have a drink at' places or interesting things to do in town. I enjoy modern art, beer, interesting foods, comedy, a wide variety of live music or good DJ, museums (City Museum looks amazing) and walking around just to look at the architecture of historic neighborhoods.

I'm a fun, witty, attractive woman in my mid 30s, so if you are looking for an extra drinking or smoking buddy please let me know. Tips on buying weed across the state line is also appreciated. : )

Thanks in advance! I'm really excited to visit the place y'all call home.",StLouis,"Visiting St. Louis next week, need advice, and possibly a drinking/smoking buddy"

The University of Missouri–St. Louis will suspend all in-person classes tomorrow, March 13, to prepare for remote teaching. Classes will be delivered remotely the week of March 16-20. Existing online classes will continue as planned. We will continue to assess our instructional delivery and communicate plans for classes following spring break. 

During this time, the university will remain open and continue to operate under normal conditions.  

It is important to note that there are no known cases of COVID-19 on the UMSL campus. However, as previously communicated, our shared goal is to ensure the health and wellbeing of our community and maintain the continuity of our academic mission moving forward.

As always, we will continue to communicate timely information as the situation evolves and encourage everyone to visit the university’s COVID-19 website for additional information.

Supply and demand are related, but create different results.

When demand spikes, as it has done recently, there will be a temporary reduction of stock (empty shelves), but quickly replenished. Net result? You’ll have months of toilet paper, and the freshly restocked shelves of teepee will get dusty over the next few weeks while everyone works through their reserves at home.

When supply is disrupted, as has NOT happened (yet), there will be a permanent reduction of stock (empty shelves), that will not be quickly replenished. Net result? Shelves will still be empty until the supply chain can be rebuilt. This is where you should stock up before things get worse.

Dear r/StLouis,

My name is David and I'm here to ask for your help. I am a student at the University of Missouri and one of my assignments for this spring is to create a ten minute documentary on any topic of my choosing. With that in mind, I'm interested in doing said documentary on the story of St. Louis and its love for football. I have been a huge football fan my entire life. The St. Louis Rams have been a key piece in instilling that love for football, along with the traditions of my hometown Mizzou Tigers. But seeing Stan Kroenke hijack the Rams to Los Angeles was heart wrenching for me, as I'm sure you all have experienced that same feeling as well. Though through it all, the city of St. Louis has endured, and eventually rewarded for its tenacity.

I want to tell a story of a city that was given a chance to shine on the NFL stage. A city that had that same chance stolen by a man who sought profits over the passion of their fans. A city that did everything they could to save their team, but to no avail. A city that struggled with both personal and financial loss after the Rams' departure. A city that was given a second chance to shine on the new football stage of the XFL, and would use this second chance to heal and recover from what they had lost. This story is about the testament of St. Louis and its sports fans. To show that through all the highs and lows of these past few years, the spirit of St. Louis will never die.

My method of telling this story will need to rely on archival footage and interviews in order to give this story the importance and respect it deserves. The archival footage in particular is intended to showcase what the city and its people were like during ""The Greatest Show on Turf,"" during the Rams' final seasons at St. Louis, during the years where football was absent in St. Louis, and during the recent events of the St. Louis Battlehawks. These clips of archival footage can range from professional quality sports broadcasts and news reports to personal camcorder/phone video made by fans and city folk alike. I'm hoping to find footage that has a resolution of 720p or better, but I would be willing to incorporate any footage that doesn't meet that benchmark if it is integral to this story.

As for interviews, I'm incredibly interested in talking with people who were season ticket holders for the Rams and the Battlehawks. It would be wonderful to talk with them about their personal stories with the St. Louis Rams and discuss how that relationship changed after the Rams left. Another person I would be interested in interviewing would be someone who was involved in the negotiations with Stan Kroenke. This would really help flesh out the methods the city of St. Louis used to try and save the Rams and help show Stan Kroenke's character a little better, although we can certainly do the same with fans as well.

One again, I want to reiterate that I want to tell the story of St. Louis and its love for football. In order to make this story right, I'm going to need some help finding and collecting archival footage to show that love of football with the Rams and the Battlehawks as well as the loss during those five years in between those teams. I would be incredibly thankful to anyone who would be willing to share their own footage for this story. However, you can simply direct me to where I can find some footage and I'll be just as thankful. If you know someone who would be a good fit to interview for this documentary, I would appreciate it if you could help me get in touch with them and see if we can conduct an interview within the near future. I understand the health risks we are facing with this corona virus pandemic, but I'm willing to negotiate that with those who are interested in being interviewed. I'm expected to complete this documentary by May 4th, so any requests before then will not be of any help to me.

If any of you are interested in hearing more about or would like to be a part of my small documentary, you can contact me via email at dls895@mail.missouri.edu or at sharpedavid5@gmail.com. Those who want to contact me via text messages will need to contact me via email or by Reddit message to further discuss options of connecting via phone. Be sure give me your name and mention this post so that I know who you are and then work form there. I have a 30 second pitch video that will help anybody interested in this story gain a better understanding of what I'm looking to do with this project. A link for this video will be placed just below this message in case you're interested in seeing it. Nonetheless, I really appreciate you all for reading this Reddit post. This is a project I really want to do and I hope that this documentary will be done the best way it can be. Who knows, if the ten minute documentary goes well, I might be interested in making this story into a complete documentary someday.

Much thanks in advance,

David Sharpe

&gt;	Another type of scam common following a disaster is price gouging. Price gouging occurs when a business charges a price that is much higher than reasonable for products. Consumers should be aware of prices, and report any business that appears to be price gouging for necessary supplies like water, ice, plywood, gas and generators.

&gt;	To report price gouging in Missouri to the Attorney General's Office, submit a complaint form online [submit a complaint form online](https://ago.mo.gov/app/consumercomplaint) or call the Consumer Protection Hotline at 1-800-392-8222.

And penalties: 

&gt;	
-	Charging within a disaster area an excessive price for any necessity (or that which the seller has reason to believe will likely be provided to consumers within a disaster area).
-	$1,000 civil penalty per violation, injunctive relief, restitution; may be charged as a Class D felony (1-7 yrs. in prison and up to $10,000 fine).

We have to have a serious talk. 

It's not me, it's you. It's you and your all gray everything. If you are in the process of flipping a house, or ""renovating"", and you havent painted, purchased flooring, installed carpeting, or otherwise coated the house with gray paint, you can still stop while you're ahead. If this isn't you and you've already decided on gray flooring, backsplash, counters, walls, and tile...I have to ask. 

What the fuck? Theres a whole goddamn color wheel out there. It's really not hard. It feels like you were too lazy to pick up a copy of better homes and skim for ideas. I'm mean, come on. Wanna know why it takes 3 days to sell a house and not 3 minutes? Because of gray. 

And for all you home sellers, thinking ""how do I increase  the value of my house? What will make it look good?"" Let me give you a hint.  You've lived in it this whole time. Chances are it was not 58 shades of gray during that period. Maybe leave it with some color? Try cleaning it? Plant some flowers? If you're really serious, hire someone who can pick out a color scheme....that isn't gray. 

I can't tell you how many people I've talked to that are serious about buying a house, but see the inside and dont wanna pay $400k for a house they are going to have to paint because it looks like a futuristic prison cell. Nobody wants to tear out brand new gray flooring, counter tops, shower tile, etc etc. and have to replace with something not shitty gray. Worse yet, nobody wants to pay for you being lazy and just painting it gray. Even a dog would get depressed and kill itself with all that gray, and they're fucking colorblind. Ever see those youtube videos where someone who cant see color gets the special glasses and boom now they see color? I seent some grown ass men crying like little bitches cause they see what they've been missing. That's how beautiful color is, watch that shit of you dont believe me fam.

Finally, to you house shoppers that have hard earned money that you are going to spend on a house....stop buying this shit! Stop buying houses with shitty poorly done renovations for stupid high prices! Jesus fuck if you guys keep on buying this shit, flippers will keep buying up perfectly good fixer uppers and slathering them in robot jizz metallic grey and patting themselves on the back. ""Good job, look at how much gray I managed to incorporate! I even painted that hideous walnut mill work gray, it looks so much better now.""

For those wondering, I didnt post a picture because all you have to do is go to zillow to see what I'm talking about. Also I didn't want to post a picture of someone's fuckshow flip job and that be what makes them realize what the fuck they've done to an otherwise perfectly good house.",StLouis,A letter to house flippers

I understand this is all still a very dynamic situation... so not all acts can be taken at once.

We’ve imposed cancellations of schools where those proven to be least at risk are now being forced to stay at home while their primary/secondary caregivers are having their hands forced into working or not getting paid. Granted I do not fit this group, as my children are all still outside the school system, but I (middle) manage several people who are now forced to either a.) empty their bank of PTO (very limited as is) or b.) take unpaid time off to care for their children during this 3+ week hiatus.

What is going to be done, in the interim, to ensure continuity of lives for those not necessarily infected or at risk of the virus, but have been directly affected by the actions of our leaders to stop the spread, effectively handcuffing them into an entirely at risk situation within a workplace and in essence forcing unpaid time off if duty calls to care for their children?

Due dates on materials will be extended during the closure. All holds will be left in place until the library reopens. Patrons are asked to keep materials at home until the library reopens. Book drops will not be available during the closure. 

The decision to close is a difficult one. The employees of St. Louis County Library care deeply about serving our community. We recognize that the Library and its many programs and services are an invaluable resource. However, we view this as the most responsible path forward to support the health and well-being of our communities at this time.

St. Louis County Library has been working in conjunction with the leadership teams at St. Louis Public Library and St. Charles City-County Library to make coordinated decisions in the best interest of the public. The nine libraries of the Municipal Library Consortium of St. Louis are considering similar measures. We will continue to monitor developments and respond accordingly.

Dear valued Y members,
Social responsibility has long been a core tenet of the Y. For more than 175 years, we have been called on in times of crisis, conflict and strife to provide for the ever-changing needs of our community.  In this unprecedented time, we recognize the need to shift our focus to better serve our community. Now, we face a new challenge, and we ask that you support us in our work.

In light of the increased threat of the COVID-19 Virus, we are changing our operations and shifting our resources to those we can best support. 

-We have, therefore, made the difficult decision to close our facilities at the close of business Tuesday, March 17 through Sunday, March 29, 2020, with the intent to reopen on Monday, March 30.  

-Our Child Care services for ages 5-12 will also close operations March 17, but we are working on offering Emergency Child Care at certain YMCA locations beginning on Monday, March 23, 2020. These locations will transition to child care centers for ages 5-12 and we will provide emergency care to support doctors, nurses, technicians, and medical staff with caring for their children during this crisis.

-Early Childhood Centers will cease operation Tuesday, March 17, 2020 at 6pm and will reopen on Monday, March 23, 2020.  While regrettable, we feel this is the most responsible course of action based on the need to consider the health and well-being of our children, families and the community-at-large. This will give us an opportunity to deep clean the facilities and implement strict new preventative health screening measures before anyone is allowed access.

-Next week, our Y team will be reaching out to our Active Older Adult members and those most vulnerable to the COVID-19 Virus to complete wellness checks during the social distancing phase of this effort. We are committed to the seniors in our community and want to let them know that we are here for them – always. 

-Even though our buildings are temporarily closed, we are providing you with an ONLINE Y COMMUNITY to exercise and stay connected. During this time, we want to continue to support your efforts to stay healthy in spirit, mind, and body.  All Y members are encouraged to access Virtual Group Exercise Classes. Your Virtual options come at no cost to stay healthy at home. Stay connected to classes, programs, and your fellow Y members on your mobile app (need access? Click here for Mobile App), and Facebook. Watch for new releases of virtual mindfulness classes, virtual youth programs, and more starting this week and throughout March and April.

For a while, our focus will be on supporting our community’s critical response teams. You can help us by continuing to support the Y.  We ask that you continue to invest in your membership so that we can maintain vital life-changing and life-saving programs at the Y. If you prefer to put your membership on hold, please fill out this MEMBERSHIP HOLD form, however, we encourage you to help us in service to others. We know your membership is meaningful to you and that meaning lies in the relationships you have built at the Y.  While some of us have the resources we need to navigate these uncertain times, many of our neighbors must turn to the Y for support now more than ever.

We continue to work closely with community leaders and will communicate with you about the status of our operations.  In the meantime, we hope that you will join us in our efforts to serve those in our community who need us most. Thank you for your support as we work diligently to ensure the health and safety of our community.

Tim Helm

2694,2694,unidentifiedfish55,1584598032,fl53qm,Nan,"Seriously can I just be honest for a little bit? I'm a tad drunk right now after playing D&amp;D and we had to do it online because of the fucking virus that's fucking everyone's lives up right now. Yes I drank while sitting in front of my webcam. Fucking judge me if you want to. 

But you know what? You guys won't. I've never posted here before I don't think. I've been in this fucking city for...wow almost 6 years now. Almost to the day. And kinda want to spew and ramble about my true thoughts about it.

Honestly? You guys are fucking great. The city. The people. The whole ""big small city"" thing is so fucking true and there's no better way to describe it. Taking a walk around the park, fucking everyone I walk by have these genuine fucking smiles on their faces and act like they're enjoying life. And they smile, nod, and wave like they fucking care about me when they've never seen me in their life. And you know what? I fucking believe them. They make my fucking day better and I give the same smile and say hi to their dog or their fucking cute adorable baby they're pushing around in a stroller and everyone acts like they're happy. What the fuck? How can this happen in a major city like this. It can't. What even is this place?

Ok so people are fucking walking around like they're happy and want to make your fucking day better. That's like...what a small town would do. And they would be fucking fake about it. Because at the end of the day they would spew ignorant bullshit and fucking vote for politicians and policies that don't give a shit about other people. But do you people do that? No. You fucking put your money where your mouth is and show you actually do fucking care about each other. That's fucking special. 

And you fucking know what? I have had a pretty fucking terrible last couple of years in general.  Went through a divorce and it was the most fucking awful thing I could have imagined.  But then  a bunch of fuckers, many of whom are native to this beautiful amazing fucking thing that you call a city...basically took me in their fucking arms and made things much less awful. It was fucking great and I have zero fucking clue where I'd be without them. Some of whom I just got done fucking web-camming with while playing that ridiculous fucking nerdy game I never played until I met them, and it's fucking amazing. And then you know what happened? The fucking hockey team started doing well. I'm a huge baseball fan but have I ever fucking cared about hockey? No. It was just kinda there. So why should I care that the hockey team started doing well? 

Well I have no fucking clue but I did. This city exploded and it was one of the most fucking awesome times of my life. Going to bars and celebrating with a bunch of fucking crazed Blues fans who are rallying behind their team. Many of which probably were in the same fucking position I was in about never having previously cared all that much. Every single fucking person in this city wearing blue and singing a god-awful 80s song and coming together and acting like you're one big fucking family. And you all fucking were. And all cared about each other. And I got sucked into it and even went to the god awful, packed, beer soaked, kinda smelly parade and sat out there all morning and got wet before anything fucking happened. And you know what? That all was the fucking time of my life and the unity was incredible and you guys really are one big fucking family. And it was all exactly what I needed in my life at the time and fuck you all.

And now this fucking...minor league football team from an attempted re-birth of a fucking failed football league comes to town? Who the fuck cares about that? Seriously? Who. The. Fuck?! And all you are yelling ""kakaw"" and acting like some ridiculous idiots who must be high off their asses on cocaine. What the fuck even is that? And how the fuck did you also make that yet another beautiful, city-unifying thing.

So yeah..what the fuck? Seriously what the fuck. It feels like every single one of you have this mentality where you want to make everyone's fucking day better, you care about each other like you're one big fucking family and you find ridiculous things to rally around and it makes everyone feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves and make people fucking feel like family and it's amazing and I don't understand how you all can be so fucking wonderful. 

And this whole Coronavirus shit sucks. It took away the Ka-Kaw team. There's no fucking baseball and that SUCKS. In fact I used to think the Cardinals were by far the best fucking thing about this city and I've learned that them and the culture around them are even fucking better than I realized and that makes them way fucking better in my book. But at the same time, thanks to all you fuckers, I realized they're only like the 10th best thing about this fucking city. 

I have no idea what the point of this rambling was. I really don't. I'll probably delete it tomorrow when I'm sober. But I thank fuck that St. Louis is amazing. We'll get through this whole fucking quarantine and kick this stupid terrifying virus in its fat ass, and social-distance the fuck out of this thing and emerge as a city even stronger once this is over.

&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice to get treated for a common illness without scheduling an appointment? Now, you can.  
&gt;  
&gt;BJC Medical Group has introduced E-Visits through MyChart for patients over the age of 12. Patients can use E-Visits to get an online diagnosis for select minor conditions. There’s no need to schedule an appointment and it’s less expensive than an office visit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**What conditions can an E-Visit treat?**  
&gt;  
&gt;At this time, patients can request care for back pain, cough, diarrhea, headache, heartburn, sinus problems, urinary problems and vaginal discharge/irritation. E-Visits may support more conditions in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How do E-Visits work?**  
&gt;  
&gt;E-Visits are accessible through a patient’s MyChart account. When a patient initiates an E-Visit, MyChart will prompt the patient to fill out a short questionnaire based on their condition. An advanced practice provider will respond with a diagnosis and treatment plan. The provider can also order further tests or prescribe medication. The patient’s information is then stored in his or her secure patient record.  
&gt;  
&gt;**When are E-Visits available?**  
&gt;  
&gt;E-Visits are available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. If a patient submits an E-Visit during this time frame, a provider will respond within two hours or less. This gives the patient even more flexibility to receive timely care. If an E-Visit questionnaire is submitted after hours, a provider will review the request the following day.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How much does an E-Visit cost?**  
&gt;  
&gt;An E-Visit costs $20, which is less than the cost of an office visit. This fee is payable by credit card and isn’t covered by insurance at this time. If the condition turns out to be serious, the provider may decide it is necessary to see the patient in person. In this case, the patient is not charged for the E-Visit, only the face-to-face office visit, for which they can use their health insurance.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Who can use E-Visits?**  
&gt;  
&gt;E-Visits are available to current patients of BJC Medical Group’s internal medicine and family medicine practices who are over the age of 12. To use this service, a patient must have signed up for a MyChart account and must have seen a BJC Medical Group primary care provider within the past year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stay tuned for future developments in E-Visit’s capabilities. This service makes it easy for patients to access care exactly when they need it. As a quicker alternative to a traditional office visit, E-Visits are a great way to feel better, faster.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next time you’re feeling ill and you’re stuck at home or at work, remember that treatment is just a few clicks away with a BJC Medical Group E-Visit.",StLouis,BJC is offering free covid-19 evisits. The usualy 20 dollar evisit fee is being waived. More info here.

So, the fiancé has officially been accepted to Wash-U for her grad program, and we are gearing up to make the move to STL in the summer! With that being said, I've been in Atlanta, GA for all 24 years of my life, and this will be our first time living together (not including sharing a college dorm together the year we met)


I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for all of these questions, but I would **greatly** appreciate any and all help here!

&amp;nbsp;

* *What's the city like?* We've visited once (coming back in April, despite the current COVID-19 panic) and loved it, but I'd like to hear more about what STL is like from a native opinion as well.

* *Any nice apartment recommendations?* We've got a couple in mind that were provided by Wash-U after her acceptance, but we'd like to hear of as many options as possible since this will be our first ""home"" together! We'd like to stay under $1,300 (utilities included) if at all possible.

* *What's the IT market like in STL/how much $ can I expect to make?* I'm studying up for my CompTIA A+ now, and plan to complete the cert by the end of April/early May. I've got 6 years of customer service exp (4 years at leadership/management level), 6 months exp as a logistics coordinator, and completed 2 years undergrad (business admin/comp sci, no degree though bc school is expensive :( ). *How difficult will it be to land my first IT gig in STL, and what kind of salary should I expect to make should I land an entry level, helpdesk job?* I want to work my way up to network engineering over time, but for right now I just want to get my foot in the door (and hopefully, not be poor).

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you so much for even stopping to read this if you do! This is an extremely scary and exciting time for the both of us, and I'm looking for all the advice I can possibly grab. I'd love any random words of wisdom as well, even if they aren't related to my questions above. I'm looking forward to becoming a citizen of STL!",StLouis,Moving to STL!

I personally don’t feel safe going into work but I don’t have a choice 1. because my small local employer can not afford to give me any benefits. 2. Why close doors when people are going out of their way to support local? 
I imagine I could take off as much work as I wanted but wouldn’t receive any pay and couldn’t guarantee my position or hours once I returned. So my employer is staying in business and reaping the benefits safe at home, while I risk my health to come in for min. wage. How is this any different than the corporations? 
You’re crazy to think these local employers will suddenly dish out sick leave during this economic crisis when they can’t afford to do so any other time. You wouldn’t put any extra money in the hands of the Starbucks CEO or Charter just to ensure they stay in business. So why are you giving it directly to my employer who has yet to mention anything to us about disinfecting our restaurant or what to do if we feel sick? My employer wouldn’t even know if I had the virus or if I’m washing my hands because they are in the safety of their home and have not set any guidelines. These businesses are only paying about half the normal staff right now but are receiving similar profits. Is that profit going back to the other half of the staff that is currently laid off?

I'm seeing stories from other countries and other states about essential  workers (public safety, health care, etc) who are putting in incredibly  long hours, and can't find supplies to take care of their own families by the time they can actually get to the store because the aisles are  bare.   This just feels unacceptable.  The people on the front lines of  this health crisis and their families should have the peace of mind that they, too, will be taken care of while they make these huge sacrifices  to help others.

We have specialty hours for shopping our most at-risk folks in society- and very often these essential workers are also shopping those exact same hours.  This doesn't seem very reasonable  to me...the folks the most being exposed to this virus by being on the  job mingling with our at-risk citizens.  Is there a way we can  encourage local stores to develop specialty hours or special  deliveries/pickups for these essential workers?  Or work with local  restaurants and their suppliers to help provide in some way?  Is this sort of thing in existence and I'm just not seeing it?  I've been looking around but haven't found anything yet.

Anyone  want to put their heads in on this and see if we can figure something out to help out everyone for the greater good?  Is this even a reasonably good idea?

In fact this type of event is the thing that would have sent me to oblivion before meditation &amp; mindfulness. This is what I came to talk about.

Most importantly, you don't have to be Buddhist to meditate. You don't have to believe any of it. I don't believe it all &amp; have a modern outlook on Zen. By no means would I ever say my way is the right way. This works for me &amp; if it strikes a chord &amp; works for you then great. 

Secondly, I like many people never thought I could meditate. I can be fidgety, scatter-brained. I can perseverate on something to the point of what feels hopeless. None of these things eliminate you from being able to meditate. THESE are actually the things we have to deal with mentally during meditation. 

When I first began to meditate I assumed it was to find a calm sense of peace or bliss. It took me years to understand that is not the case. Meditation is in a way a decision to spend time you may not necessarily enjoy understanding it is a benefit you may not see or understand initially. 

There is no good meditation or bad meditation. Each is different from every other one. I've had some peaceful meditations. I've had excited meditations where I found myself looking forward to a friend's party. I've had meditation full of grief after my dad died. I've had angry meditation where I found obsession with someone who pissed me off. Just sit for whatever time you planned on. It could even be 5 minutes. AS LONG AS YOU SIT THERE YOU CAN'T REALLY FUCK UP. I can't stress this enough.

-------
Meditation in our Soto Zen is called zazen (""seated meditation"") or specifically shikantaza [shee-can-TA-za] (literally translates as ""just sitting""). It really is 'just sitting.' If we set aside a time of day &amp; length of time to 'just sit' it gives us a chance to not act on any of the thoughts, desires, impulses, emotions, feelings, etc... that come into consciousness. By not acting on them we discover a space between thoughts (feelings, etc...) and our usual acting on them. With continued sitting (meditation) this space becomes more elastic. I say elastic because some days it's better than others - just like everything else. Having this space reveals something about ourselves easily overlooked. This leads to compassion (both for ourselves &amp; others), patience &amp; increased peace. Note that these three things are NOT the goal of meditation &amp; mindfulness (taking our awareness with us into daily life).

The 'goal' of meditation is simply to continually &amp; endlessly straighten our posture - we can't be lost in thought if we are trying to keep our back straight. In this way it's like sitting at attention. (Sort of like the military trope of 'standing at attention.') (See book rec below regarding this: Opening the Hand of Thought.)

When we sit, we feel our breath going in &amp; out, sometimes listening to the sounds we hear all while keeping our posture the best we can. I've never had a meditation where my posture was kept the entire time. It is impossible to keep our bodies straight. All the thoughts (feelings, emotions, etc...) that arise are ok &amp; necessary. Our stomach digests food, our brains digest reality. It is our brain's job to plan a meal, go grocery shopping, solve daily problems, protect our emotions, bodies from harm. Currently my brain is trying to solve this puzzle of the pandemic by coming up with scenarios that *may* happen. (This is heavily the subject matter of the book by Robert Wright listed below.) In this way NOTHING that arises within us is bad. Not even the thought that someone we hate should die. There are no good thoughts or bad thoughts - they are just thoughts. 

Just like warmth, moisture &amp; darkness are the conditions for a seed to sprout, the circumstances in your life are the conditions that give rise to all the thoughts (feelings, desires, impulses, emotions, etc...). In this way they are not yours. Try not to take them personally. (Easier said than done I know.) For instance, when we are taking a walk &amp; we turn around a corner of a building it is only then (when the conditions are right) that we see around the building. We don't take what we see as ours (personally) just because the conditions are right for us to take in the new scene but for some reason we take the thoughts that arise in our head (due to the conditions in our life) personally. I find that interesting &amp; helpful. Right now I find many thoughts &amp; worries about the pandemic. 

Sitting by simply letting thoughts (feelings, etc...) come &amp; go changes our relationship to them. I don't believe they ever go away but they can lose some of their influence on us.

My favorite Zen books. Each has changed what Zen practice is for me:

•NOTHING SPECIAL by Charolotte Joko Beck
https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062511171
Great beginners' book. Heartfelt. Little to no terminology.

•ZEN MIND, BEGINNERS MIND by Shunryu Suzuki
https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781590308493
He uses lots of good analogies &amp; dives into some terminology.

•OPENING THE HAND OF THOUGHT by Kosho Uchiyama
https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780861713578
I love the title of the book - he coined the phrase. Quite demonstrative of what Zen is. Breaks down teachings wonderfully. He actually has a diagram of what meditation is - it's clarifying.

•THE FEELING BUDDHA by David Brazier
https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780312295097
Written by a psychotherapist. An unorthodox view of Zen. Changed my practice &amp; made clear what Zen really is.

•HOW TO COOK YOUR LIFE by Kosho Uchiyama
https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781590302910
A commentary on an old text that instructed the monastery cook. Makes analogies on how to approach everyday life.

•WHY BUDDHISM IS TRUE by Robert Wright
https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781439195468
A modern take on Buddhism by an evolutionary psychologist. Explains how the 'suffering' spoken of in Buddhism (better translation is unsatisfactoriness) is simply a genetic byproduct of evolution.

I’m all for freedom and for government not always being involved, but a lot of people are getting sick and dying and personally I wish the order would have been more strict. Hospitals in New York are already overwhelmed - building tents, repurposing buildings for patients. The majority of those hospitalized there are 18-49 years old. Young healthy people can’t breathe on their own and are being intubated. Healthcare workers don’t have PPE to protect themselves. Doctors and nurses are already being repurposed from other departments because there are so many cases.  I’m frustrated by so many people I’ve seen who are not taking this seriously - both young people and old people. 

It’s already beginning here. Please STL, let’s learn from this. Please stay at home unless your job is absolutely essential. Show employers the who want you to come in the data and what’s already happening in our country. I know this is extremely devastating to our economy, but when hospitals are full, people can’t be taken care of. That includes people who need to be taken care of for non-covid issues - If hospitals are full and overwhelmed, that grandpa with a stroke or dad with a heart attack or friend with the suicide attempt can’t get care either. If you’re sick, monitor your symptoms carefully and stay home. If you think you’ve been exposed to someone who is sick, stay home. If you want to get together with friends in your home, realize that still isn’t social distancing. At this point, we should all operate as if we have this virus and not go out unless absolutely necessary . We have a chance to learn from other cities and states and try to minimize deaths.",StLouis,STL has a chance to learn from other cities/states

Because socializing outside has rapidly become an impossibility, we're using this space to create some normalcy in this time of uncertainty.

There's separate channels for discussion on movies/games/tv/books, and voice-channels to play games and watch movies together. Feel free to use the link below, and invite whomever you think would enjoy this space. If anyone has any questions, feel free to PM me or leave a comment.

We don't know if that will be in weeks or months, but, barring anything catastrophic, it will happen. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard announced yesterday that unemployment could hit 30%. Needless to say, these are tough times. Add the fact that St. Louis has made vast improvements to the local economy in the past year after so many hard years and the timing seems like it couldn't have been worse.

However, if there's one thing St. Louis is good at it, it's coming together when it's needed the most. We've already seen it in the past week with all of the initiatives to support local businesses and restaurants. With that in mind I was hoping that those of us that frequent this subreddit could brainstorm on this post (or elsewhere if it gets to that) what we can all do to reduce the ripple-effect of this as much as possible, for the community as a whole but specifically for those that will be most impacted. This could be anything from current opportunities to make money while we're all on lockdown (e.g. tech training, etc) to future community service projects we can organize, political topics, ways to be more prepared for something like this in the future (this will happen again), etc.

3075,3075,lsathrowaway18,1585068821,fo8gpm,Nan,"First off, let me say that WashU is a fantastic institution that does a lot for the local community. Furthermore, they have done a fair amount to handle this situation: being one of the earlier schools to move classes online, continuing to pay student workers as if they were still on campus, committing research towards a cure, and obviously all of the hard working people at BJC. I have no problem with WashU and I'm happy to be a student there. However, it's time for them to step up.

WashU sent out an email that, basically, said ""if you've been to any of these places you have to call this COVID-19 hotline and get cleared before coming to campus at all"". I had travelled to one of the locations listed, but when I called the hotline they weren't even aware that the place I had been to was even on the list. A friend of mine who had travelled to one of the other locations listed had the exact same experience. Also, the operators on the hotline obviously knew less about the virus in general than most people. The aforementioned email also listed an email address to contact if symptoms appeared. When I emailed them, however, the response consisted of little more than the typical ""wash your hands, stay inside as much as possible for 14 days, and call 911 if conditions become critical"".

Other universities across the country are setting up their own testing services. In Birmingham, for example, University of Alabama at Birmingham is doing up to 250 drive thru tests a day. Even churches in Birmingham are providing testing. However, here the best bet for most is Mercy, which is requiring ridiculous testing requirements including travel history, despite the fact that the virus has already infiltrated the community and is spreading. There are no excuses why a smaller city with far fewer resources is able to supply all of this while St. Louis cannot. Specifically, there is no reason why a public school in that smaller city is able to supply all of this while one of the richest and most prestigious universities in the world cannot.

Once there you have to read and agree to a bunch of legalities to file it officially. I never did that, I contacted the county via the email that the administrator shared a few days back on twitter. However the reason I did so was to check if my company qualified as an ""essential company""(it does), And then I fucked up by mentioning that we weren't doing a ""great"" job with the social distancing (with any detail). I have no idea why I even tossed it in there, but I guess it was from being stressed out and paranoid. Anyhow at the end of the response the county person said they ""forwarded my concern to the health dept"". Fuck... me....

So I spent the last two days trying to figure out how to ""update"" the situation and make sure the company doesn't get the doors kicked in. For one I would've never reported the violation officially and I sure as hell wouldn't have agreed to all of the legalities needed. Secondly my employer actually did improve things that afternoon so thing are legit better.

With all that being said I am wondering since I didn't agree to anything legal as well as fill out the long form asking for more detailed information on the violation (I was vague obviously) if this is going to end up pure hell. Or if the lady forwarded it over for them to ""possibly"" ask me some details, and ""maybe"" tell me that I need to file an official report. 

I know this post ends up being more of a rambling stress thing, but I am sitting here waiting for a health department swat team while being anxious as hell. BUT I have one piece of hope that since I didn't go through the legal (official) process that not much will be done in regards to this. 

Thoughts?

As you may know, S. 3398 was introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (SC) on March 5, 2020. This bill would establish a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention to develop best practices that providers of interactive computer services may choose to implement in order to prevent, reduce, and respond to the online sexual exploitation of children, including the enticement, grooming, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse of children and the proliferation of online child sexual abuse material. 
S. 3398 has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, on which I do not serve. However, should this legislation come before me in the U.S. House of Representatives, I will be sure to keep your comments in mind.
Again, thank you for contacting me on this important issue. Hearing the views of all Missourians gives me the opportunity to better understand how important public policy items could impact the people of our state and the future interests of our nation. In that regard, your input is most helpful.

I have seen this tool (not-peer reviewed) by University of Toronto researches . Perhaps some experts here can help us to estimate the maximum daily number of incidents St. Louis area can handle at full capacity.

[https://caic-rt.shinyapps.io/CAIC-RT/](https://caic-rt.shinyapps.io/CAIC-RT/)

The related paper is [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043711v1.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043711v1.full.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

The tool has some predefined values based on data from China for expected resource utilization.  I don't know #acute care beds, #critical care beds, or # mechanical ventilators in St. Louis. However, I have found some information on the web.

STL area has around 9,300 beds in the hospitals. I'm assuming any  of them  can be utilized for acute care. [https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-hospitals-likely-wont-have-enough-room-treat-every-coronavirus-patient#stream/0](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-hospitals-likely-wont-have-enough-room-treat-every-coronavirus-patient#stream/0)

STL area has 748 ICU beds: [https://health.mo.gov/safety/healthservregs/pdf/MOlicICUbeds.pdf](https://health.mo.gov/safety/healthservregs/pdf/MOlicICUbeds.pdf)

I couldn't find number of mechanical  ventilators but there is a 2010 study ([https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/mechanical-ventilators-in-us-acute-care-hospitals/F1FDBACA53531F2A150D6AD8E96F144D](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/mechanical-ventilators-in-us-acute-care-hospitals/F1FDBACA53531F2A150D6AD8E96F144D))  that says the median value per 100,000 population is 19.7.  While I suspect, with several large medical facilities, St. Louis is far above this value, I will just be conservative. With 1.5 million population,  STL metropolitan area  should have around  296  ventilators. 

&amp;#x200B;

So putting all these number in the tool, and using default %25 resource allocation for COVID19,  the tool shows that St. Louis can handle 790 new  cases per day  for acute care. However, ICU beds are far fewer, and it shows that ICU limits the #new cases to 107 per day and ventilators can only handle 85 new cases per day.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on what we read around the world,  hospitals can add new ICU beds but ventilators are limiting factor. If St. Louis has 85  ventilators (again this may be a low estimate for the region), and 80% of the ventilators are allocated for COVID19, than the capacity increases significantly to 272.

Before anybody get anxious, remember that at this time, area  hospitals are not at  full capacity and hopefully  they will not reach to that level. But I think it is safe to assume that St. Louis can handle at least 270 new cases per day when the hospitals reach their full capacity.  Again, I suspect actual number of ventilators are significantly more in the region. Furthermore, MO has a cache of 247 ventilators ([https://web.mhanet.com/SQI/Emergency%20Preparedness/Response%20Resource/StateOwned%20Ventilator%20Cache.pdf](https://web.mhanet.com/SQI/Emergency%20Preparedness/Response%20Resource/StateOwned%20Ventilator%20Cache.pdf)) and there are local manufacturers.  

**If there are experts here that can tell us actual number of ventilators  that would be great.**

As a side note, if the new treatments  fulfill their promises and reduce the number of days for each care type,  STL can probably handle more than 500  cases per day.",StLouis,Estimating maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases manageable by St. Louis

3251,3251,xGARP,1585347207,fq73ij,Nan,"The past few weeks have been a very stressful time for all of us, and I hope you and your family are remaining healthy and safe. What began as a great start to 2020 has us now facing an unimaginable new challenge. I remember the impact of past economic crises, such as the 2008/2009 recession, but those don’t compare to the toll COVID-19 has taken on the gaming and hospitality sector. According to a report from Moody’s Investor Services, the gaming industry is second only to the major airlines in terms of the most impacted industries by the pandemic.

With all of our 41 properties in 19 states temporarily shuttered, we are making difficult decisions to help preserve our liquidity and ensure a brighter future for our Company’s team members, customers, shareholders and other key stakeholders. As CEO, I am committed to doing everything in my power to ensure we persevere and figure out a way to come out of this stronger and better than ever.

Since having to suspend operations at our properties, Penn National has been continuing to pay our team members their full wages and benefits through March 31. However, several states have announced extensions of their temporary closure orders and other states may soon follow suit. Given the uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic, and with no meaningful revenue for the foreseeable future, Penn National will be implementing unpaid furloughs impacting approximately 26,000 team members companywide beginning April 1.

This decision was extremely difficult to make for all of us at Penn. Penn National is a family, and we deeply regret the hardship this will place on our team members and their loved ones. To try to help ease some of the burden, we’re maintaining medical benefits for eligible team members through June 30.

In addition, Penn National has established a special COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund under our Penn National Gaming Foundation to provide direct assistance to team members and local relief organizations in need in our communities. We have already raised over $1.2 million in dedicated relief funds, including more than $425,000 in personal contributions from me and my senior management team, our Board of Directors, and our GMs. We will continue to work tirelessly to grow these relief funds over the coming days and weeks.

I am proud of the fact that when the call came down from our governors across the country to temporarily close our facilities, our team members managed the process in a safe and orderly fashion, ensuring the health and well-being of our guests. I’m equally proud of the fact that since closing our doors over a week ago, our properties have donated more than 45 tons of food to local food banks and homeless shelters in our communities, ensuring our perishable food items can help those in need. In addition, our properties have donated thousands of unused masks and surgical gloves to first responders and health care providers. In times of crisis, we come together.

Penn National is taking the following additional short-term actions to reduce our cost structure during the property closures:
 
• Immediate, meaningful pay cuts for me and our remaining property and corporate leadership teams until such time as our properties have substantially returned to normal operations;
• Our Board of Directors has elected to forgo any of their cash compensation until such time as our properties have substantially returned to normal operations;
• The majority of Corporate team members will also be furloughed, and we’ll be operating with a minimum, mission critical staffing of less than 850 team members companywide during the closures.
 
Pride, hard work, perseverance, family focus and grit has defined us over the years at Penn National, and that is exactly what will get our Company through this current challenge as well.

I recognize that you have many choices in how to spend your entertainment dollars and I am so appreciative for the loyalty you have shown to our casinos and team members over the years. We will continue to update you about your local casino through email and through our social media accounts. In the meantime, please be mindful to take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones, including social distancing and recognizing those who are most vulnerable, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

Sincerely,

3269,3269,atomic_implication,1585372657,fqdz85,Nan,"The numbers of Coronavirus cases are being under-reported because hospitals are refusing to test patients. I thought you deserve some more accurate numbers, so I did the math to find out what the actual numbers are and wanted to share them with you. Even using very optimistic estimates as I do in this model, the numbers are much much larger than reported.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the bottom line:

&amp;#x200B;

As of March 28th, there are almost certainly at least 20 people in the Saint Louis Metro Area who have died from COVID-19. There are almost certainly at least 581198 active cases in the Saint Louis Metro Area. At least 7628 people have had it already and gotten better.

&amp;#x200B;

The Stay-at-Home Order will slow the spread. But just three days after the order lifts on the 17th, we will be back to the level of infection we were before it began. Here are some graphs of what will happen if the Stay-at-Home Order lifts on the 17th as planned, then nothing else is done until the beginning of May. By May, it will have spread to the entire STL Combined Statistical Area:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/SvqfiNI.png](https://i.imgur.com/SvqfiNI.png)

&amp;#x200B;

See below for a full table of my numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

This virus is dangerous because it spreads incredibly quickly and easily. In order to stabilize this in any serious way, we will need to either shut down for much longer periods of time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I built the model where I got those numbers:

&amp;#x200B;

We know that it takes Coronavirus patients 5 days to go from infection to showing symptoms. After this, it takes an average of 14 days to recover. So 19 days after infection, most patients are either recovered or dead. We know that the first Coronavirus related death in St Louis was reported on 3/18/20. That means she probably became infected 19 days earlier, on 2/28/20. This would be the first instance we know of of someone in STL having Corona.

&amp;#x200B;

But the virus has about a 1% death rate. So for that one person who died from an infection, 99 other people were likely also infected on the same day, but survived. So on the day of 2/28/20, there were likely 100 people in STL infected with Corona, of which 99 eventually recovered.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at numbers on spread in both the US and China, the spread rate of Corona looks to be about 35% per day. That is, each day, you get a number of new cases equal to about 35% of the number of active cases. If there were 100 new infections in STL on 3/28, then the number of active cases the day before (2/27/20) would have been about 285.71.

&amp;#x200B;

Because we know the infection rate, we can then work backwards and see that the first case would have come into STL on or around 2/8/20.

&amp;#x200B;

We know that most people either die or recover in 19 days. So after the 19th day of Corona coming to Saint Louis, can say that the number of active cases os equal to:

&amp;#x200B;

(number of active cases the previous day + 35%) - (the number of people who were new cases 19 days prior and are now either better or dead)

&amp;#x200B;

On March 23rd, a stay at home order went into effect that is set to last until April 17th. If we are being very optimistic and assume everyone who can is staying home, this would have reduced human-to-human contact to less than a tenth of what it was before, taking the growth rate from 35% per day to maybe 3% per day. I used this as the growth rate when calculating 3/24/20 through 4/18/20 using the formula given above.

&amp;#x200B;

After the order is lifted, many people will likely be much more careful when going out in public. Nevertheless, people will have to go back to work. Additionally, there are those who do not take it seriously and will act like they did before. social contact (and therefore the spread of the disease) will be half of what it was before if we are, again, being optimistic. From 4/19/20 onward, I used the formula given above, but this time using a growth rate half of what it was before - 17.5%. By May, the entirety of the St Louis Statistical Area will have been infected.

&amp;#x200B;

3273,3273,imakeholesinu,1585403017,fqkf0b,Nan,"Had to go out yesterday to get my weekly groceries and the stores are limiting things like Eggs to 1 dozen per customer and raw packaged meat to maximum of 2 per customer.

This kind of concerns me because I typically buy 3 or 4 different meat products when I shop and at least 2 dozen eggs. 

I was only able to get half of my typical grocery list which means I have to make a second trip to the store in order to get what I need for the week. This is ridiculously dangerous that I need to roll the dice again to buy what I need to stay home. 

I understand the grocery store chains are doing this to stop runs on certain staples and panic buying but now it is going to put more people at risk who have to potentially go out again and again because of these arbitrary limits on said items. 

Just an FYI, if you're wanting to get more than 1 weeks supply you'll likely have to risk going to multiple stores, exposing yourself to more people who may or may not practice social distancing. Good luck.",StLouis,Stores limiting certain items is only going to make this worse

I do the order pickup system along with a small team, and our side of the business has always been stable with hours, but recently has quadrupled in terms of orders! It's been hard to keep up and I wanted to give you all the chance to ask questions. I work today so they will be answered as I have break times at work and tomorrow when I have off.

We generally are pretty happy that people are using our system because it means people staying out of the store! We're just as susceptible to Covid-19 and some of my coworkers are elderly. We're pretty scared for ourselves and them, as we have few supplies ourselves. We're happy to have received gloves recently! No masks though :(

Some items are worse to pick up than others- and it's causing you to have to wait longer for your order. There's a few big items that people are picking up that are quite difficult given that the orders have quadrupled. We really are running out of room and that's even with having our ""order pickup hold area"" tripled for last Christmas! Please keep your orders small and with smaller items.

If you do need to come in, it's fine - please note that we, by nature of our jobs, can't really do much about the 6 ft rule. We HAVE to rush around you to get orders done in time. We can't wait till you leave the aisle. We get that you have to come in for perishables but that's ok because we don't pick them up so we're not in those aisles! If you come in for that and large items, we'll be able to stay out of those aisles and generally be able to respect the 6 ft rule.",StLouis,Target Order Pickup worker here. Some tips - and AMA

He then transitions to the Man in the Arena passage of President Roosevelt's [Citizenship in a Republic speech] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic). 

I inferred from this he was tired of people critical of first responders, though I am sure 99% of us support first responders. The criticism is with him. 

He also takes affront to a reporter asking if the state is working with the Corps of Engineers. I think the question was based on the fact St. Louis County Executive Sam Page tweeted the county is working with them. The state has said nothing about this until today.

&gt;From SLU  ER nurse in STL:

&gt;Seriously you guys. A few days ago taking care of a covid positive patient my mom asked me are you scared, I said no, this is my job, and I meant it. Driving to work tonight I was crying, I am terrified. Things have changed in the last 48 hours in St. Louis. Things are BAD here. Just because you think you are being smart that you won't catch it, going about your daily lives, going to stores for ""essentials"" aka booze, getting carry out. these things are seriously not ok. You cannot trust other people, and that is how you will get the disease. Not from a mistake you made, but from someone else's. Do not be naive. We admitted 15 patients in 3 hours last night all for covid. All by me and four other icu nurses. We have to actively wheel one patient out while wheeling the next patient in. I got calls every 10 minutes from the ER asking me are you ready for the next patient are you ready for the next patient? We weren't, but we had no choice. I had a patient who was 30 and breathing fine and crying to me asking why she had to be here and isolated. Tonight she in intubated and non responsive, that is how quickly she deteriorated. One of our ER doctors is on the verge of death from covid, likely going to die. He got it from being exposed here in the ER. Doctors are telling me they don't want to come see my patients cause they are scared and they don't want to get it. They don't even want to come around to our units and look through the windows. We are all honestly crying and laughing together because we are scared and we have zero protection and it's comical how unprepared we are and how we have no idea what we are doing when treating this disease. No one is listening. Please don't be fuc**** idiots you guys. I'm serious. Stay the fu** home unless is it ESSENTIAL. I fear things are only just starting here, we aren't even at the peak yet. This disease KILLS the lungs, your lungs turn into scar tissue. They do not recover. Please be smart and protect yourselves. I'm asking you guys this from the bottom of my heart. A week ago I was naive and blowing this off. I am now seeing this first hand. I am scared. That's my rant for now.

A recent [plan](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/) suggests that 5 - 7 ICU beds are needed for every 10,000 adults, implying that the St. Louis area would need approximately 1,500 - 2,100 beds (assuming 3 million people in area), which is at least [double](https://health.mo.gov/safety/healthservregs/pdf/MOlicICUbeds.pdf) the current number of beds. Even if you consider only [80%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/stlouiscitymissouricounty) of the population as adults, you still see a sizable shortage.

I also saw another dr for a consult in Illinois in Swansea but he seemed super rushed and all he did was have me get x rays and when he came in to talk about what he thought to do he literally was like ok this is what’s were gonna do and if you don’t get it done quickly your teeth might shift forward and make things worse and then just walked out didn’t even take a look at my teeth at all.

I just wanted to see if anyone else experienced the same thing. I tried contacting their recruiting team to let them know to no avail. Here are the issues I have experienced:

First, there seem to be pertinent fields **present on mobile devices that are not present on a desktop**. I have compiled a list of these fields below:  


* Screen 2
   * Address (line 2)
   * Work Phone Number
   * Advanced Notice
   * Date of Availability
* Screen 4
   * Instructions for education submissions (list all history including high school, don't include partially completed educations, etc.)
   * Field of Study
   * GPA
   * ""Status of this Education"" is a field on the desktop that is missing from the mobile device
* Screen 5 Mobile / Screen 6 Desktop
   * Instructions for work experience submissions (provide name of the actual employer for contractors, etc.)
   * Job Function must be chosen via the ""Select"" button
      * **The desktop does not provide a ""Select"" button for the Job Function field; it is only present for the Employer field. Applications are then immediately rejected for missing ""Job Function"" if the job function field was populated via typing on the desktop.**
   * Reason for leaving
* Screen 6 Mobile / Screen 7 Desktop
   * Instructions for attachments (what can be attached, how to overwrite attachments, explanation of the ""Relevant Files"" column, etc.)

Second, if the job status changes to ""No Longer in Consideration"", the ""View/Edit Submission"" option does not provide any details as to why the application was rejected via desktop. However, when viewed on a mobile device, the details are provided.

  
Third, if an applicant applies to multiple positions for which they would request different salaries, the ""View/Edit Submission"" option does not accurately reflect the information submitted at the time of application. Rather, it seems to record the most recent information submitted. For example, if I applied for an Analyst I position requesting $60,000/year and then applied for an Analyst II position requesting $65,000/year, the requested salary field for the Analyst I position using the View/Edit Submission option would then say $65,000. Attempting to edit the requested salary for that position back to $60,000 would then also modify the requested salary for the Analyst II position to $60,000.

Regarding federal and state programs: a lot of times, there is a pretty significant waiting period for stuff like snap, medicaid, etc. If you do lose your health insurance and are likely to go without for at least a few months, I would get a medicaid app in asap so at least you will have that sooner rather than later. For food stuff, check out the food pantry info below if you really need food while waiting on snap or other programs.

Find a mask, make a mask, do whatever, but wear a face covering when you are in public. Especially if you are not sick. This virus passes via people who have no symptoms even while just talking within a few feet of them. 

It doesn't feel real here STL because you don't know someone who has died yet. But the chances are in a month you will. We can all save a lot of lives by 1.) Staying home 2.) Staying at least 6 feet from other people in public places 3.) Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when in public. 

Don't believe me? Here is what the CDC just posted today: 

""CDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States.  We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.  This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.  **In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.** ""

- Meet your neighbors from their balcony. Try to write down the names of everyone on your street at least, and behind you! 

- Get to know their jobs. Connections baby. That's how rich people get that way, they know people. If your neighbor doesn't have one, send them to me, o have plenty. Or give them ideas for jobs you know. Connect them up baby! 

- Put weird things on your porch or in your windows. Break out all the holiday stuff! Write inspirational stuff on your brick walls in chalk! 

- Spruce up your yard if you can. Make your neighbors yard look bad. Then....help them spruce theirs up! Especially if they are poor, elderly, or Essential and Exhausted!

And in the midst of this terrible despair, it offers us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have built for ourselves. Nothing could be worse than a return to normality.

3687,3687,Wisdomkills,1586063784,fv8gsx,Nan,"Understandably during these times our focus is on the health of ourselves &amp; those around us. That said, it is also at times like these when the most vulnerable of us can fall through the cracks. They can then fall right onto the shoulders of our already strained public systems. Or worse, be abandoned to perish in the elements.

Not only is this a health and humanitarian issue, but it is also a collective failure to act. That may be due to a lack of focus on this area as other things take precedence, or maybe there is just no robust plan in place to approach this, or something else entirely.

It is no doubt that many of our regional issues exacerbate one another. Crime, poverty, drugs, disinvestment, classism, homelessness, and others are all inextricably linked. Mechanisms of governance and policy throughout our history have resulted in a framework of failure in each of these areas.

So let's for a moment consider - if we could start from here - what could we do as a region to quell the growth of our homeless population and move towards uplifting it entirely. We would thereby bring these people out of abject poverty improving their lives considerably. We would cut down on the burden they place on social services due to their lack of access to basic things like hygiene and medicine. And secondarily we would improve many parts of our city - many popular areas in which they congregate and consume as the only community they know. While this does create a sense of safety and community for them, it comes at a cost. It creates areas of avoidance to tourists and visitors and does not improve our city's appearance or reputation to both the visitors and to the locals. [Example](https://imgur.com/gallery/6fjOB0m/)

Context is also important. It is necessary to consider the causes of homelessness. [Sources](https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/) describe some of the main causes of homelessness as: lack of affordable housing, unemployment, (mental &amp; physical) health issues, domestic violence, racial disparities, addiction, or catastrophic loss of family/stability

[A paper](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/Why.pdf) by the National Coalition for the Homeless states

&gt;*Homelessness results from a complex set of circumstances that require people to choose between food, shelter, and other basic needs. Only a concerted effort to ensure jobs that pay a living wage, adequate support for those who cannot work, affordable housing, and access to health care will bring an end to homelessness.*

For brevity I am omitting many historically relevant details of how we arrived here. But as our city (and metro) is beginning to escape over a half century of stagnation it is imperative we take full advantage of this wave of improvement. Prior to this pandemic lockdown we had been experiencing a massive positive surge. Over $9 Billion in investment just in the city's central corridor alone. (List at the bottom) This is a much needed influx of cash and attention. One which will generate wealth for the whole region. Wealth which can then be used for the public good. IE- helping end the homeless crisis. Which would only further improve our regions position by making our city more attractive for visitors/customers which thereby makes it more attractive for businesses. 

So in preparation for what will come after this pandemic is over - when business returns and progression resumes, considering all of the above - what do you feel we could do to make sure none of our neighbors are forced to spend a night on the street,in a park, on a bus stop bench, or under a bridge?

It will take us all as a collective unit to accomplish this, just as it will to fix any of our issues in the STL. There is no 'they'. One area's problem is all of our problem. None of us live in a vacuum. If we do not contribute to a solution, then we perpetuate the issue. We will ALL benefit from a solution. Even the most selfish among us should realize this.

Thank you all!

&amp;#x200B;

In the spirit of the holiest week of my faith tradition, I wish to extend to any fellow St. Louisans, my brothers and sisters in this fucking incredible town, an offer of goodwill. See below. You owe me nothing. Not even a thank you. I want to help if you need help. I happened to find this stuff at market today; no hoarding here. I was thrilled to be able to pick some goodies up and know that they could go to good use.

I have acquired through completely legitimate means--this is not sarcasm; each item has been paid for in a legitimate marketplace at fair market prices TODAY, April 7--two 4 oz. containers of commercially made hand sanitizer; six individual double rolls of Cottonelle Professional two-ply toilet paper; four rolls in one pack of 2-ply Charmin Ultra Soft.

I am well-stocked on hand sanitizer and toilet paper already. So: If you and/or your family are TRULY in need of some supplies, please message me and I will deliver what you need, disinfected to the level of which I am capable (Clorox wipes; sunlight) in clean plastic bags, to your home in the St. Louis area. I am also happy to ship out of town. Again, these are FREE to those in need. Ask for only what you need, not the entire thing, unless you really need the entire thing, and we'll talk. I just want to make sure I can help as many people as possible with what I have.

The mods were kind enough to approve this post as I truly want to help where I can.

Please, ask only if you truly NEED this for yourself or your family, or someone you know who is struggling to make ends meet. I was fortunate enough to find all of this at market today, am fortunate enough to have enough to tide me over for a while anyway, and as a famous first-century Jew once said, it is more blessed to give than it is to receive.

NB: Sadly, Sven the Dog, my S'Well full of Manhattans, and the pewter clock and Echo Harp are not available for donation. But--Sven says ""Skål!"" to y'all!

Be well and be safe, my friends. And please let me know if I can help via PM.

We own a four family building where we rent out the two bottom apartments and live on the top floor. Our tenants are also friends and seem to not be taking the stay at home/social distancing order seriously. I know both are coming and going frequently (not working). We share a back yard, back steps, and other common areas outside. Tonight they had a few friends over (but standing far apart). We both expressed that we didn't think this was a good idea, especially to be grilling out together. We did not partake obviously, and our message of ""no, don't do that"" didn't seem to go through.

I feel like we are going to have to draft a letter of official building policy during this time. I don't want anyone over here, but know we can't control what goes on in their apartments. However, I do feel as if we can enforce a ""no hanging out in groups in our shared back yard"" policy. Is it futile to do that since they are probably just going to have people over in their apartments and their recklessness is going to end with us all getting it anyway? Am I being alarmist? 

Would appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to proceed. My sister is a nurse at Barnes and has been staying at an airbnb in isolation from her family for the past 3 weeks.

The unemployment rate fell to 3.3% in February. 3,000 positions were added, and 6,900 workers left the labor force causing the unemployment rate decrease. The overall Nonfarm Payrolls figure did not change significantly. No individual sector saw significant employment changes.

I am starting to feel the effects of being cooped up here, and I don't know what to try or do.

We've gotten out a few times to take a walk through Tower Grove park which was nice. We have enjoyed a couple of nights sitting with our upstairs neighbors on the patio (respecting distance).

We've done some Jackbox nights over Zoom with family and friends.

Despite everything, I'm still losing my mind. I can feel anxiety taking over, and it's definitely affecting my work and my mental health.

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm alone. And if I'm not, what anybody else is doing to try and combat this.

After crossing Delmar Blvd I was impressed by the increased number of people walking/standing on the sidewalk (many were not practicing social distancing). I smiled and waved as I ran past one guy, and he yelled b***h (this startled me a little because I wasn't tripping). A few seconds later, across 7 lanes of traffic another guy yelled ""don't be jogging up here it's not safe, go back to Forest Park."" I waved at him as I kept running but thought, maybe I shouldn't go all the way to Natural Bridge. So I went down Page then Union and back to the park. As I ran by Soldan HS I thought about how sad it was that there are so many homeless people despite so many vacant buildings especially along this route.

On my way home, I ran south down Hampton over Hwy 40. At Oakland Ave I entered the crosswalk just before a car whipped around the corner making a right turn. I wasn't badly hurt but the large black suv did make contact with me but the driver just kept going without checking. I was stunned for half a second but then ran in the opposite direction back toward the park to try to get a plate number. Unfortunately, cars are faster than humans and I couldn't catch up. But there is a camera above the intersection, maybe it was recording at 1:47pm.

A black volkswagom almost did the same thing 2 minuets later at the McDonald's but I held out my hand as she was about to turn right and she slammed on her brakes without hitting me. I waved to her as she mouthed sorry though the tinted window. By now my heart beat didn't even change.

Well, the reason is because our fragmented government is now causing our region to be left behind when it comes to federal stimulus dollars to assist in offsetting some of the fiscal impact to our already fragile budgets in both the City and the County. 

St. Louis City and St. Louis County both have less than 1 million residents inside their boarders, which means we missed out on a portion of the 2nd wave of Stimulus package from the CARES act passage where $150 Billion dollars will be divided up based on City populations of greater than 500,000 Residents (St. Louis City has 300,000 residents) and County populations of greater than 1 million residents (St. Louis County has 890,000 residents).  Now, had City and County merged we would have at least qualified for some stimulus, like Jackson County, which includes Kansas City.  

Remember when Better Together, the dirty word of 2019, compared us to other cities that had incorporated like Louisville, Nashville and Indianapolis? All three of those cities will receive at least $100 million from the fed.  St. Louis City? 0. Maplewood? 0.  Brentwood? 0.  Bel-Nor? 0.  Chesterfield? 0. 

Just this morning, the next round of Fiscal stimulus to expand SBA will also include more for municipal relief at the same thresholds as before was announced.  That package is more than $2.2 Trillion dollars now.  How much will the St. Louis region get?  0.",StLouis,Making the Merger case in the time of COVID-19

Dear KSD Families,

It is with a heavy heart that we announce that our students and staff will not return to school buildings for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.   This decision, while very difficult, was made in conjunction with guidance from local health and government officials. We will continue to follow their guidance as we make decisions on end of year events, keeping the best interest of the health and safety of our students, staff, and communities as our priority. 

Knowing that our connection with our families is crucial right now, we plan to continue to support our students and school community.  This support includes the continuation of online learning, the provision of social-emotional and wellness supports and grab and go meals. 

I recognize that this news impacts each of us differently, and I'm sure there are and will be many questions.  I do not want to overwhelm you with details at this time, but please look for additional information in the coming days, from your school principal and through our KSD eSpotlight.   

Please know that we are here for you and will continue to provide the compassion and consistency our students need at this time.  We will continue to improve and add [online resources](https://www.kirkwoodschools.org/domain/1873) as we navigate these unchartered waters together.

320,320,Azarias59,1586723366,g044z3,Nan,"I'm so sick of hearing about how ""Saint Louis is the most dangerous city in the country."" The only reason people believe this is because of the high crime statistics from the STL city proper.  So today I decided do a bit of research to figure out what our statistics *really* look like. Here's what I uncovered:

Out of 364 metro areas, Saint Louis is ranked #88 for violent crime at a rate of 455 per 100,000 people. Anchorage, Memphis, Albuquerque, &amp; Detroit are all far more dangerous than us with violent crime rates higher than 1000 per 100,000 people. This puts us in the top 25%, but barely. When you look at murders alone, we are at #10 with 12.9 murders per 100,000 people. This puts us in the top 3%, but Detroit, Memphis, and Philidelphia are still quite a bit higher than us at 17 murders for 100,000 people.

So what's the moral of this story? Well, we do have a fair bit of crime - and our murder rate is indeed something to be concerned about - but we are nowhere near being the most dangerous city in the country. 

Here's a link to the report for anyone interseted: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/tables/table-6.

 **Notes**: 

* For some reason there was no aggregated data posted for Chicago, Vegas, Houston, and San Antonio, so they were not factored into my ranking.

Just to clear things up: I am white and upper-middle class, so it’ll be clear I’m not from the neighborhood. Yes, I know North City’s reputation. Yes, I always am aware of my surroundings and I know the city well. Yes, I know that you’ll find less trouble if you don’t go looking for it.

That all being said, what kinds of risks am I facing moving into a neighborhood like Hyde Park, and what can I take to ameliorate those? Obviously having a secure place to park off-street, and a security system in my house would be a start, of course.

After taking precautions like this, how much am I taking my life into my hands? Are shootings common enough that I still am at the risk of being hit by a stray bullet? Will anything happen to me in broad daylight? Should I purchase a gun? How many times should I expect my car to be broken into or stolen in a year?

How safe will I be doing day to day activities, like reading or picnicking in the park, going around for a jog, eating at a local restaurant, unloading groceries from my car, exiting my Uber after a night out, etc? Will I just get funny looks, or a knife in my face?

So our [company](https://www.atredis.com/ppe) has been working to procure and deliver surgical masks and KN95s (Chinese N95s, which are currently [cleared by the FDA during this crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/health/coronavirus-n95-kn95-masks.html)) from sources outside the normal hospital supply chains. I've been working with a US expat in Hong Kong I found via one of the Coronavirus subs. There are no guarantees anywhere right now but I have no reason to believe these aren't legitimate, and this is one of the only options we've got at the moment.

All in all we hope to ship out about 20,000 masks or more as they come in over the next few weeks. I thought I'd ask around here too, because it would be great if these helped folks in my own city as well.

Yes, I know hospitals are taking donations. We're also hearing that they're not accepting KN95s or that they're accepting them but storing them to use as a last resort. Meanwhile other staff are being allotted one disposable paper mask per week. So we are donating to hospitals but we need to be 100% sure these will get used, and the best way to do that seems to be directly to doctors and nurses, not through procurement departments.

So, if you're in STL, and work on the front lines of the pandemic in some way (hospital, paramedic, first responder) and _you can use KN95s right now_, send me a DM and I can set up a drop off or pickup. I'm in the CWE.

Likewise, if you're supporting the effort in some other way (homeless shelter, nursing home, essential workers, Doordash and Instacart, etc) and in need of masks, I've got surgical masks I'm happy to give to you, as well as some KN95s that were marked as ""not for medical use"" to make it through customs when this all started. 

I'll also have washable cloth masks, in batches of ten, via [Sew Valley](https://sewvalley.org/) in Cincinnati shortly. We're hoping to give these out to folks like restaurant and grocery workers.",StLouis,Anyone working on the front lines who can use KN95 masks?

I dont really have much pain, except for sensitivity when eating or drinking cold things. But there is one spot on the right upper side of my mouth where I have a clear cavity. Even I can see the gap in the mirror. Cant even chew in that area of my mouth as a result. 

I really wouldnt consider this to be my definition of a dental emergency. But is there anywhere to go to get this looked at? I dont know if my gums can make it 1 or 2 or more months until my usual dentist opens back up. I need to know if I have gingivitis or if it's gone beyond that.

Thank you for any help.",StLouis,Is there anywhere to get cavities filled right now? I messed up

 They may be on hiatus for the foreseeable future, but the St. Louis Cardinals are stepping up for their community during a time of need. The organization is teaming with Anheuser-Busch, FOX Sports Midwest and the American Red Cross to host a blood drive this month at Busch Stadium.

The event is set for Tuesday, April 21 and calls for blood and platelet donations, with a particular need for Type O blood donors. Donations are appointment-only through an online registration [**here**](https://www.mlb.com/cardinals/community/blood-drive).

“We are proud to support our partners at the American Red Cross by opening up the Cardinals Club at Busch Stadium for a blood drive,” said Michael Hall, Cardinals’ VP of Community Relations, in a release. “The vast space we have allows the Red Cross to set up a blood drive with appropriate social distancing guidelines in place at this time.”

The Cardinals have hosted an annual blood drive each summer since 2004 and are poised to do so again June 17-19. April’s one-day drive came to be as the American Red Cross faces a dire need for blood and platelets amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because so many local volunteer opportunities have been put on pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, we've created a Discord community to organize and facilitate volunteer opportunities that can be done remotely and with computers. We're all emphasizing more online social gatherings, and having weekly movie/game nights.

We're 3D-printing face shields for medical professionals, assisting in the Folding@home distributed computing project for simulating proteins (to assist in finding a cure for COVID), and compiling resources to donate and assist the community in this troubling time. We also have off-topic channels and weekly game/movie nights.
