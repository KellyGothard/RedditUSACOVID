1.  Save all bacon grease. You will be instructed later how to use it.


2.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is what they live for.


3.  Remember: ""Y'all"" is singular. ""All y'all"" is plural. ""All y'all's"" is plural possessive.


4.  Get used to the phrase ""It's not the heat, it's the humidity"". And the collateral phrase ""You call this hot? Wait'll August.""


5.  Don't tell us how you did it anywhere else. Nobody cares.


6.  If you think it's too hot, don't worry. It'll cool down-in December.


7.  A Mercedes-Benz is not a status symbol; a Chevy, Dodge, or Ford is.


8.  If someone says they're ""fixin"" to do something, that doesn't mean anything's broken.


9.  The value of a parking space is not determined by the distance to the door, but the availability of shade.


10.  If you are a slower moving vehicle on a two lane road pull onto the shoulder - that is called ""courtesy.""


11.  BBQ is a food group. It does NOT mean grilling burgers and hot dogs outdoors.


12.  Yes, weddings, funerals, and divorces must take into account for Husker football games. 


13.  Everything is better with hot sauce.


14.  DO NOT honk your horn at us to be obnoxious, we will sit there until we die.


15.  We pull over and stop for emergency vehicles to pass. 


16.  We pull over for funeral processions, turn our music off and men remove hats or caps. Some people put their hand over their heart.


17. ""Bless your Heart"" is a nice way of saying you're an idiot.


18.  No mater what kind - sprite, coke, pepsi, mtn dew, it isn't called soda: Its all called pop. 


19.  If you don't like the weather in Nebraska, wait 15 minutes - it will change.


20.  Fried, with gravy, is the usual way of serving‚Ä¶ well, most everything.


21.  The Indy 500 is a tradition.


22.  Sweet tea, with ice or not, is looked upon as normal.  Un-sweet tea, you must be from somewhere else.


23.  Maps?  Maps?  We don‚Äôt need no stinkin‚Äô maps.  Just follow the landmarks.


24.  Chili is served with Cinnamon Rolls.",Nebraska,How many of these are actually true?

A lot of my friends are asking me ""Why Nebraska?"". I'm from a big city, but I grew up in a more rural area.

Honestly, I'm *sick*. I want some rest, I want some quiet and clean air, I want to see a sky that's not polluted with light like it is here.

I dont want to be stuck in a bunch of tourist traps though, so if you've got recommendations please let me know.

I love wildlife and botany, I'm a decent photographer, an artist, I'm technically certified in astronomy (as in the viewing of the stars and planets, not horiscope stuff) I'm not squeamish or anything like that, I've done a lot of hiking and I'd like to do more but my body is really failing me right now and I dont know if it's going to get better, which I guess is why I'm trying to really get out somewhere I've never been. (I'm on experimental drugs that are taking a toll on me).

Your favorite local shops? Restaurants? Greenhouses? Museums and art galleries? Animal sanctuaries? Weird antique shops? Best places to catch the sunrise? The sunset? Maybe your favorite place to go and just enjoy the view and the sounds?

If there happens to be a Crane Foundation somewhere out there I'd love to visit.


And is there anything I should beware of? Areas to avoid, dangerous wildlife(?)

I haven't been there in a while so it really felt like I was exploring it for the first time. Unfortunately, the outdoor walkways on the 14th floor were closed (probably due to cold temperatures), but I was really drawn to those murals that are up there in the center dome section. Towards the end of our visit we realized that there was a free tour we could've gone on, but we had already pretty much seen it all by that point, and we also definitely did not want to deal with a flock of screaming kids who were in attendance. This, however, made me kinda bummed because I'm sure the tour guide would have been able to give us some more background/insight on all the intriguing works of art that are littered around the main halls. So, I was wondering if y'all have a favorite piece or story about the building and could explain why you like it with a little bit of background of the work itself. It's a really cool, historic building and definitely worth the trip if you haven't visited already!

It could be at a National Park or just off your back porch. Feel free to get creative with it.

The bodies of Beau Gealy, 29, and Maci Baily, 18, were found in a storage unit of the Jerry's Self Storage facility northwest of Scottsbluff.

According to information released on Tuesday, March 3, by Scotts Bluff County Attorney Dave Eubanks, the attending physician stated that there was no evidence of trauma.¬† 

He also said that although the visible evidence is consistent with asphyxia, which is the state of being deprived of oxygen, he cannot make a final determination on the cause and manner of death until he receives toxicology reports, which could take several weeks.

So  I currently live in Las Vegas. I've been here long enough to be at the  point where the clubs, bars, gambling, ect., are not a part of my  lifelstyle. The desert has gotten boring. Career options are limited  (unless I want to move to Los Angeles, where taxes &amp; cost of living  are through the roof).

I've got a  job offer in Lincoln (I'm in the architectural field), that pays about  10% less than I'm currently making. However, cost of living seems to be  about 50% of the cost I'm currently paying. It doesn't seem like a bad  trade-off economically.

I'm the outdoorsy type. I hike, kayak and fish often.

The issue, however, is that people like my dad need to use the bathroom frequently and because he's driving out of town to attend these events, he obviously can't return to his private restroom. So he'll have to use the public restroom, like all of the other attendees.

That isn't social distancing.

That isn't how it works.

Stay home. Go for a walk in the park, or a short drive around your home town, pee on a tree if you must.
