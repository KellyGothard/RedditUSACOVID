Not many job opportunities ot much medical care either as those are all small towns fairly isolated from larger cities.   If these things matter and you seem to be interested in north Idaho your better off looking in the Couer d Alene, Moscow, or Lewiston areas.

The area generally suffers from a population that doesn‚Äôt value education the way it should, an insufficient infrastructure in some regards, and generally lower paying jobs than the jumped up cost of living can support. In the Boise area, home prices have doubled in the last 5 years; pricing out most all the locals from home ownership - especially on the bottom end of the income spectrum. A lot of that home appreciation is due to out of state buyers coming to the market and paying cash for properties. I think this same thing could be said about many popular municipalities though.

&gt; No known felonies have been committed in the Zone of Death since Kalt's discovery. However, a poacher named Michael Belderrain illegally shot an elk in the Montana section of Yellowstone. While that section of the park does have enough residents to form a jury, it might be difficult to put together a standing and fair one due to travel or unwillingness of members of the small population there to serve. A judge ruled that Belderrain should be tried in the nearest Montana district rather than the sparsely populated Wyoming district. Belderrain cited Kalt's paper ""The Perfect Crime"" to explain why he believed it was illegal to have his trial conducted in a different district than where the crime was committed. The judge disagreed, and Belderrain pleaded guilty before a trial in either district could be conducted.[8]",1578271061,fdcbn6r

""I hope there'll be pine trees in Heaven, 
and mountains all covered with snow. 
With plenty of room to stretch out in, 
like we have here in Idaho.

I hope there'll be pine trees in Heaven, 
to shade the clear streams where they flow, 
with water that's nectar for drinkin', 
like we have here in Idaho.

I love all the hills, streams and valleys, 
the thought of them gives me a thrill. 
And I think I could stand leaving this world, 
if I knew they could be with me still.

And if there aren't pine trees in Heaven, 
I hope there's some place I can go, 
where they'll have all the things I'll be missing,

My advice would not to move there.  I think you would probably like the job, but have zero social life.  It would be extremely small town from what you are used to.  Imagine being confined to only going out to 3-4 places. Or having to travel a few hours to get something different.  Small town people think twin falls is a bigger place, because in Idaho it is.  But compared to places back east, it is really confined and small town.   I think your social life would suck too, because you are not Mormon.     Outdoors are ok, but probably not what you are thinking.   There is a lot more desert down there compared to the rest of the state.   

If you want small town, rural social life, and openness, move.

&gt;Idaho is one of the fastest growing states in the nation, which is experiencing one of its longest economic expansions in U.S. history.

&gt;But Idaho‚Äôs governor is not looking to capitalize on this economic windfall by boosting spending and ordering big-ticket items.

&gt;During the annual state of the state address and budget presentation on Monday, Republican Gov. Brad Little presented the state‚Äôs most conservative budget since 2014.

&gt;Little‚Äôs proposed $4.1 billion budget, a 3.75% increase, that cuts spending, leaves a surplus and bolsters the state‚Äôs rainy day funds.

&gt;‚ÄúIdaho has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. But nationally and internationally, the pace of economic growth is expected to slow,‚Äù Little said during his &gt;address to a joint session of the Idaho Senate and House.

&gt;‚ÄúMy budget leaves an appropriate cash balance and shores up our rainy-day funds, which have helped us weather economic storms that forced other states to raise taxes,‚Äù he &gt;said.

&gt;‚ÄúIdaho is ranked in the top 10 states nationally for the balance of our budget reserves, but a credible stress test showed we have more work to do to prepare for a &gt;recession.‚Äù

&gt;The annual address forecasts the governor‚Äôs agenda for the coming year.

&gt;‚ÄúAs we enter the year 2020, my priorities are sharp, clear, and in focus. My goal reflects the need for us to make Idaho strong today and prepared for tomorrow,‚Äù Little &gt;said. ‚ÄúI am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans‚Äô prosperity and quality of life.‚Äù

&gt;Little outlined his spending and policy priorities in many areas.

&gt;###EDUCATION IN IDAHO

&gt;The state spends about half of its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little‚Äôs budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on &gt;increasing the reading ability of young students.

&gt;‚ÄúMy budget keeps the foot on the gas and makes our historic investment in literacy ongoing,‚Äù he said.

&gt;He is also recommending $7.7 million for the second year of funding increases for starting teacher pay, which would rise to $40,000. Another $30 million will be aimed at &gt;increasing pay for experienced teachers. Performance criteria will ensure accountability, he said.

&gt;###PRISON, JAIL OVERCROWDING IN THE GEM STATE

&gt;With the state prison system at capacity, Idaho is forced to house about 650 of its inmates out of state and about 900 in county jails across the state.

&gt;Little said he plans to add more capacity and reduce the burden on county jails by sending an additional 500 inmates out of state and adding 146 beds through a remodeling &gt;project at Idaho State Correctional Institution south of Boise. He said he also proposes adding 160 new beds when the new Twin Falls re-entry center opens in October.

&gt;But adding more capacity is not a long-term solution, nor does it address the real problem Idaho faces: recidivism, Little explained.

&gt;‚ÄúWe must also acknowledge that our communities are put at risk when we simply warehouse those who break the law,‚Äù Little said.

&gt;‚ÄúTwo-thirds of Idaho inmates are in prison because of probation and parole violations ‚Äì more than any other state in the country. Idaho taxpayers pay $110 million per year &gt;to incarcerate this population.‚Äù

&gt;Little is calling for a new program, called Connection and Intervention Stations, that ‚Äúwill offer support, treatment and accountability for the people on community supervision who need it most.‚Äù The program will identify 2,000 highest risk offenders under IDOC supervision and connect them with such resources as transitional housing &gt;and drug testing to help them avoid re-offending.

&gt;###GROCERY TAX CREDIT CHANGES

&gt;Idaho‚Äôs sales tax on groceries has long been a source of contention. Opponents say it places an unfair burden on low-income people; proponents say the grocery-tax credit alleviates that and the grocery tax is a needed revenue source. Eliminating both the sales tax on groceries and the grocery tax credit would leave the state with about a &gt;$100 million annual shortfall.

&gt;Recently, though, the state started putting its online sales tax revenue into a tax relief fund.

&gt;‚ÄúOnline sales tax money has been coming in strong at about $6 million a month,‚Äù Little‚Äôs budget chief, Alex Adams, told reporters Monday.

&gt;Little announced he wants to put $35 million from the tax-relief fund toward grocery tax relief.

&gt;‚ÄúOne of the staples of conservative governing is to put money back into taxpayers‚Äô pockets,‚Äù Little said. ‚ÄúI have long supported tax relief for Idahoans on the most basic &gt;of needs ‚Äì groceries.‚Äù

&gt;The details of how the grocery tax relief will work is something the governor and lawmakers need to work out this session, but ‚Äúall options are on the table,‚Äù Adams said.

&gt;###RAINY DAY FUNDS AND BUDGET SURPLUS

&gt;When the Great Recession hit, Idaho tapped into its rainy day funds to keep the state afloat. While some of that money has been replenished, Little said it is not enough.

&gt;‚ÄúThat is why I am also calling for us to raise the cap on our main rainy-day fund, so that we can better position our state for any economic condition,‚Äù he said.

&gt;In addition to bolstering rainy day funds by $102 million, Little‚Äôs proposed budget includes a surplus of $60 million this year and $61 million next year, ensuring a &gt;cushion for economic uncertainty.

&gt;Little also said issues with the state‚Äôs tax revenue projections last year should be resolved.

&gt;Following President Donald Trump‚Äôs tax changes and Idaho‚Äôs conformity with those changes, Idaho was unsure of the full effect it would have on tax revenue. That‚Äôs why state tax-collection revenues last year ping-ponged above and below monthly projections, prompting Little to do some mid-year holdbacks and call for future agency budget &gt;cuts.

&gt;Now that analysts have a full cycle of tax collection data, they can re-calibrate monthly and annual tax collection projections, and, hopefully, this year will be more &gt;even keel.

&gt;###FRAUD AND ABUSE HOTLINE FOR STATE EMPLOYEES

&gt;In the last decade, the state has spent millions of dollars defending and settling whistleblower lawsuits. Little said he thinks the state ‚Äúcan do a better job.‚Äù

&gt;Little said he is ‚Äúborrowing a page from the private sector and creating a new hotline where state employees can turn to report instances of fraud, waste, or abuse within &gt;state government. ‚Äú

&gt;The Division of Human Resources would be in charge of implementing a new state employee hotline this year, which should give state employees a secure, anonymous outlet to &gt;report concerns.

&gt;###REPUBLICANS RESPOND

&gt;Each year following the state of the state address, Republican and Democratic legislative caucuses give their response to the governor‚Äôs proposals.

&gt;House Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, said the governor‚Äôs plan is ‚Äúwell received‚Äù ‚Äî especially the proposed budget.

&gt;‚ÄúIt has been since 2014 that we have had a governor who pitched a budget that is at that level of 3.75% and, quote, without gimmicks,‚Äù Bedke said.

&gt;Bedke has said he has been leery of messing with the grocery tax and its credit because the state budget is built with that revenue. Currently the state receives about &gt;$270 million annually from its sales tax on groceries, Bedke explained. The cost of the grocery tax credit ‚Äî $100 per person and $120 for seniors ‚Äî is about $157 million.

&gt;‚ÄúSo if we just walked away from it, the gap is more than $110 million,‚Äù Bedke said, referring to simply ending the grocery tax.

&gt;Given an already tight proposed budget, walking away from $110 million would mean additional cuts must be made.

&gt;But Bedke liked the idea of putting money toward grocery tax relief.

&gt;‚ÄúWhat if we took that $35 million and raised the grocery tax credit? Bedke asked. By bumping the tax credit to $125, it would ‚Äúshield about $175 of grocery purchases every &gt;month.‚Äù

&gt;Additionally, Bedke explained taking this first step of reducing some but not all of the grocery tax revenue lessens the gap next year ‚Äúand you get closer to being able to &gt;remove the grocery tax credit and the sales tax at the same time and not have impact to state revenues.‚Äù

&gt;Increasing capacity for state inmates also met with House GOP caucus approval, but Bedke said, ‚ÄúI would just as soon we house them in Idaho,‚Äù Bedke said. ‚ÄúI think &gt;long-term Idaho needs to house its own prisoners.‚Äù

&gt;One issue House GOP leadership has declared a priority was missing from Little‚Äôs speech.

&gt;Little‚Äôs address ‚Äúwas a little light on property taxes and what the state could do policy-wise that would give some property tax relief,‚Äù Bedke said.

&gt;Last week during the Associated Press legislative preview, Bedke commented on rising property taxes, which has prevented some people from buying houses and pushed out &gt;homeowners who can no longer afford the taxes.

&gt;‚ÄúIf someone who has had their home paid off for 15 or 20 years has watched their property taxes more than double in the past eight years, something is wrong,‚Äù Bedke said.

&gt;‚ÄúThere is no justification for this doubling,‚Äù Bedke said. ‚ÄúIf we point to growth as being the cause of this person‚Äôs taxes going up from $2,000 to $5,000 in the last &gt;eight years, then growth is not paying for growth.‚Äù

&gt;Property taxes are collected by local governments, like cities and counties. The state does not collect property taxes.

&gt;House Majority Leader Mike Moyle, R-Star, said Monday he attributes burgeoning property taxes to growth not paying for itself and local governments‚Äô ‚Äúbloated budgets.‚Äù

&gt;###DEMOCRATS RESPOND

&gt;New House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the caucus is glad the governor is finally addressing prison overcrowding and criminal justice reform.

&gt;The Democratic caucus said it disagrees with the GOP caucus‚Äô assessment that excessive local government spending is to blame for steep property tax increases.

&gt;‚ÄúWe do not believe it is bloated local government,‚Äù Rubel said, adding that she believes local governments are operating as lean as they can.

&gt;‚ÄúWe feel, by far, the greatest culprit is the state‚Äôs failure to fund education and other critical needs at the state level, which is where it should be funded, which has &gt;been driving, as we all know, high levels of bonds and levies at the local level,‚Äù she said.

&gt;‚ÄúAcross the state, so many districts have to pass these supplemental bonds and levies to be able to function with any kind of reasonable school system and that all lands &gt;on people‚Äôs property taxes,‚Äù Rubel said.

&gt;Rubel also noted the ‚Äúpast, perhaps reckless, tax cuts‚Äù that benefited the wealthy ‚Äî not working Idahoans ‚Äî has left the state ‚Äúfacing pretty severe agency cuts.‚Äù

&gt;In October, Little announced a 1% budget cut for this year and 2% for next year for all agencies except K-12 public schools.

&gt;‚ÄúWhen you consider the state (population) has grown 2% in the past year,‚Äù Rubel said, ‚Äúone of the things we are very concerned about is making sure those cuts do not &gt;result in unmanageable reductions in needed services when we are looking at a larger population that has to be serviced with a smaller pool of resources.‚Äù

&gt;Senate Minority Leader Michelle Stennett, D-Ketchum, said she is pleased to hear the governor propose increased funding for all levels of education.

&gt;‚ÄúUnderfunded, our schools struggle to pay a competitive wage, attract teachers to their communities, and have adequately trained teachers in the classroom. Quality &gt;educators head to other states where they receive better wages and benefits for their background, education, and hard work,‚Äù she said.

&gt;Stennett also said she was ‚Äúsurprised and pleased‚Äù that Little is putting $100 million toward transportation, a 7% increase over last year.

&gt;‚ÄúBy the (Idaho) Transportation Department‚Äôs own standards, we are a quarter of a million dollars behind on maintenance and we are not even beginning to address the amount &gt;of pressure we are going to have from new growth,‚Äù she said.",1578376309,fdg181i

I kind of view the place as one large strip mall full of churches, car dealerships, and chain retail and restaurants.   The canyon is great for golf, hiking, and paddleboarding / kayaking.  It is sort of underutilized. 

The same can be said of the college and downtown.  Both are charming, but for the regular person, not much that pulls you there.

Otherwise... don't expect much else in the way of cultural or social offerings.

I think most people stick to their friends from high school and their family.  It will be hard, if not impossible, to make friends.  Work, or church, if you go, will be pretty much the only options.  You'll get a lot of attention dating, but the question for you will be finding anyone worth spending 10 minutes on.  Twin Falls has very blue collar, anti-intellectual, good ol' farm boy type of people.  LDS, yes... those too.  And just everyone else will go to work, go home and watch TV, rinse and repeat.

And boy, is it windy there.  It is very much flat, wide open high desert surrounded by farms and dairies.  Very windy.

Therefore, they're not increasing the tax base (because most of their income isn't taxable), they're not investing in the state, and any 'economic investment' they're making is in housing: which drives prices up for the people who *are* working and paying taxes. 

Idaho *still* has one of the lowest average take-home pay rates in the country, and we are experiencing a two decades long brain-drain. Our rates of high school completion are dismal, and we are very near the bottom when it comes to citizens with either a Batchelors, Masters, or Doctoral degree.

Unfortunately for most people, housing has become so expensive and wages static what choice do they really have, and once again there will be a huge number of people who will be exposed in the next recession, mostly because any wealth or savings they might have (if even that) will be tied up in the equity of their home, which is likely already leveraged by a second mortgage / HELOC anyway.

Additionally the builders will, as always, over build for the demand.",1578517865,fdl6h8y
473,88Anchorless88,"I didn't say rent control, but to be frank, that is coming to the table as a ""solution"" to escalating rents.  I think we actually agree here that's not a solution.   

But here's the thing:  there's a predetermined sequence of events with growth.  Other cities and states experienced this sequence of events much earlier than we have.   We will try the exact same things other states have tried, and we will have the exact same results. 

We are now discussing rent control.  Tried and failed elsewhere. 
We are now discussing a Prop 13 sort of property tax relief.  Tried in California and is a huge failure.  
The City of Eagle just voted in a mayor and city council who reject the idea of dense development, and want to continue estate-lot single family zoning sprawl.  Tried elsewhere and failed. 

So we're going to eventually start seeing California housing prices and California level housing crisis.  It will be much softer because (a) we don't have a fraction of the economy that California has, (b) we obviously don't have the population California has and won't for a long, long, long time, and (c) we're more committed spatially to sprawl, rather than dense development, meaning we'll grow a little more like Phoenix or Houston... meaning we can keep housing prices a bit lower but we put the costs of growth elsewhere - in road and infrastructure costs, which are almost always subsidized by existing residents and dense urban cores, and by commuting costs and time.

So, if you're being honest about this, you know there's always a balance to be found with how much to tax, how much we can spend, and how much we can regulate or not.  It's never all the way to one side, or all the way to the other.  My argument is we need to find a balance which stunts runaway growth, but not so much that our economy begins to decline.",1578517935,fdl6ma4

Thanks for the reply, btw.",1578518074,fdl6x1s
475,88Anchorless88,"Actually, none of that is true. 

1.  Not everywhere has a current problem with the price of housing, but yes... most growing places do.  That's an important distinction. 

It should also be pointed out that our population continues to urbanize, and continues to move west and south.   So most of the places people are moving are in fact experiencing problems with the cost of housing. 

We have been building fewer and fewer units since the 90s, and that trend continues to this day.  Yes, the recession put a steep decline in new units, but we have been under-building for many decades.  There's an entire forum that discusses this (r/urbanplanning) and has all of the data you might way.  

But part of the problem with just saying ""we're not building enough housing"" is that we're not building enough housing in certain places, but we're overbuilt in others.  And we have a hell of a time predicting migration patterns, and there's an entire concept of ""induced demand"" with respect to housing that suggests if you build more housing, and that keeps prices stable, you'll just have more people wanting to move there, which will in turn push prices back up and once again we're underbuilt.   

Builders almost NEVER over build for demand.  In fact, the opposite is true.  If they control the supply, it makes their product more valuable.   They can't restrict supply too much because ultimately they want to build more units, but they also don't want to be left holding the bag if demand falls or we enter into a recession.  Developers are absolutely risk averse.  

On the other hand, if allowed, you might see developers build fewer detached single family units, and more dense, multistory units if that mode of development were allowed and there was less red tape.",1578518335,fdl7gc9

Idaho in terms of education is a circus show and no one has the answers.  I am bias and hate the STEM route that everyone is buying into.

668,VRTemjin,"I think Common Core is a failure, trying to reconcile education into a one-size-fits-all approach. It doesn't account for people with higher aptitudes of learning and holds them back during the rigors of continued education; and it also doesn't account for the fact that there are multiple learning styles, but instead presents topics as if there is only one ""right"" way to do things (from what I've seen). There's a lot of shortcomings to this style of education, but I'd wager that nobody is really willing to reinvent the school systems because investing in different teaching styles and strategies will cost more money.

But there is another problem that exists, and that's the attitude towards education, especially in the more rural parts of the state. I recall a coworker telling of a recruiter for the University of Idaho having a gun pulled at him when trying to recruit a high-schooler because the father believed college was perceived as a threat to their way of life and a threat to their core religious beliefs. If we want K-12 education to thrive, you need to have people enthusiastic about teaching and learning, instead of people with a tribal mindset homeschooling their kids, often with the Bible as a big part of their syllabus.

I'd argue that the underperformance of K-12 education in the state is also hurting higher education. The universities have been struggling to recruit in-state folks and attracting out-of-state or foreign students, all of which is their main revenue streams--and the state budget isn't helping either. Budget reductions that cut programs and staff are happening, and lack of funding is making these institutions suffer.

Depriving the state of an effective public school system will cause brain drain, but convincing people that it's something that is good for the state is another issue entirely. Effective schooling depends on enthusiastic teachers, enthusiastic students, and an engaging curriculum. The state probably needs a better standard than Common Core to get ahead, but it is arguably better than no standards at all (as the article suggests could happen if the house and senate vote to repeal standards).",1578681686,fdraiem

So they go through the same curriculum just at a faster pace. We started him in the basic classes because the school had no placement tests for their standards when coming into the school. We had to wait for the ISAT in the spring, because his previous State testing didn't roll over.

It does snow couples months but we haven't had a lot of snow lately  the last two years had been very minimal. It can get kinda chilly in the spring though. I think the treasure valley (Boise, Meridian, Nampa) people are a bit more friendly than your typical small town. In Emmett and the surrounding areas there are a lot of ranchers. People tend to be not as friendly in those areas. Most of the people here are Christians or Mormans. They are not friendly towards people from California to the point where people spit on people's car if they have cali plates.  There are people who don't disclose that they're from California. Its saddening because I actually love the state and all of the things it has to offer. And not all are as aggressive those are just personal experiences from family members. There is a river that runs through boise but obviously the price for a home is a bit higher there. Boise does have a ski and snowboarding place called bogus basin on the boise mountain. McCall, Cascade, and Donally are beautiful places to fish, kayak, camp, and more only a few hours away less than 3. Check out the Boise greenbelt it's a great walk. Meridian is a fast growing city and has a place called The Village at Meridian which is a shopping spot and has a theater. Nampa and Caldwell is going to be your least favorite, I only say that because that's as ghetto as it gets in Idaho. It's not terrible but not as nice as boise or meridian. Boise is the capital of Idaho and has their college right by the greenbelt and the zoo close to downtown. People are more liberal compared to Emmett or small towns because of the increase of young people in the area. My favorite activities in Boise are the farmers market, the air balloon festival, the botanical garden, and downtown shops. Meridian has the village which is one of the most popular spots in the valley. You should also check out Eagle city. I'm sitting at a coffee shop there right now. It's right above meridian next to boise. All these cities are connected which make it easy to just drive to the boise mall or the boise airport. Eagle is small and a bit more expensive to live but its beautiful as well. I really understand why so many people want to move here. It's close to any outdoor activity you can imagine little hidden hot springs, great for building a family and safe. The school district in Boise and Eagle are probably the best compared to the surrounding areas. I recently took a trip to LA and it blew my mind. The people there were way nicer but it was impossible to take a little getaway trip to another city without being on the most busy freeway. The traffic here is great and taking a trip to maCall is a treat and breeze to drive to. I really suggest taking a trip here and you'll understand why so many people are choosing to live here. Jobs are fine, the minimum wage here is 7.25 so not that great unless you have a good job. If you choose to live in the treasure valley I'll gladly welcome you here.

789,roland_gilead,"Hey OP, Here is my opinion of the location: *(Grew up in Nampa, moved away from the state for about 10-12 years, moved back with my partner and live in boise proper.)*

**Cons:** 

* **Schools and education.** I went to Nampa High. Lack of funds (because people aren't willing to pass bonds or raise taxes) has caused the school facilities to fall into repair. Leaks and drips are common to find. My mom went to her reunion last year and there were buckets around every hallway. Despite the teacher's best efforts, there is a serious need  of modernization. This can be attributed to a lack of funding and infrastructure. If you move here, do your best to get into east Boise or a highly rated private school. Can be difficult to get into if you're outside of the district. 
* **Education cont**: Local universities are *ok*. U of I is probably the best bet and the  new director at BSU is looking to improve BSU's academia. They are also somewhat expensive for what you are getting.  
* **Sprawl and lack of infrastructure.** I love Boise because everything is so close. I'm literally 15 min away from everything.  But that's because I'm in Boise proper. I feel for anyone that lives on the outskirts of Boise or the suburbs. It's a painful commute and many main streets get clogged up around busy times. Between a lack of investment, the rapid growth, and the lack of high density planning has crippled the area. You can look at Denver as an example of what Boise's future will be highway wise at some point.
* **The poor stay poor, the rich get richer**. There's a lack of upward mobility in this state for the under privileged. If you move here, be sure to have your ducks in a row prior to moving. Tech, housing and artisan jobs are successful though.
* **Housing.** Want a refurbished mid century house? Expect to pay all cash and most houses are gone within the weekend. 

**Pros:**

* Hella cheap to start an LLC and like I said, if you are tech, investor, an artisan (with outside connections), or a specialized industry...it's pretty great.
* People are fine as everywhere else. Most people are pretty nice and curious. You get your heels and pieces of shit, but you can find that everywhere. Idaho definitely has a special brand of that though. 
* Wilderness is really great and easy access from Boise. I did hear the ski resort completely fill up recently. That is pretty rare. White water rafting, backpacking, floating the river, biking, etc. 
* There's a lot of great events to do in Boise during the summer.",1578956074,feb79ld

Further, some priesthoods are better than others. Perhaps your hubby completed his priest-in-training at Fred's college.

Reality remains. Government work is make work, high-paying welfare. People in the marketplace are not calling for it.

If you're coming here to see about living here, your trip should see what living here is like.  I would target the hospitals you are looking to work at, and can likely get a job at; then figure out locations you would like to live (and can afford to live).  Then drive from those neighborhoods to work during your expected shift hours, and back again, to see if you have a commute you can endure.  Then see what things are in the area you might live in that you can do recreationally. 

Everyone comes here and checks out the same stuff: downtown, the Greenbelt, the foothills, the Northend, Highway 55 to McCall, Stanley, etc.  Then they get this image in their head that their daily lives will be full of those things.  But then they move here and end up living in a boring subdivision in sprawled out Meridian, can't walk or bike to anything, have to drive everywhere, have to suffer the shit-tastic commute from Meridian, and they in fact never end up visiting the places they saw when they moved here anyway.  What the fuck is the point?

My two cents:  working as a nurse gives you more flexibility to avoid the rush hour traffic, and you should make enough to rent near or close to downtown or the Northend.  If you can do this, then move here.  If you can't, and you have to live or work in Nampa, Meridian, or Caldwell, I'd skip it faster than fast and look somewhere else.",1579208377,fekvde9

We had 4WD, and were traveling at a sensible speed and distance, but when people do unexpected and dangerous things, there is still only so much time and space to react. We had a huge semi coming up behind us that also had to make an instantaneous decision and movement. We very nearly became a Suburban sandwich between the minivan and semi.

&gt;The Idaho House of Representatives quickly expelled one of its members less than 24 hours after Texas federal jury convicted him of a felony.

&gt;North Idaho Republican John Green‚Äôs guilty verdict on Wednesday put the House in a spin as it worked to determine the legal ramifications of a sitting House member &gt;receiving a felony conviction.

&gt;Shortly after the verdict, Green told The Associated Press that he will not resign his legislative seat.

&gt;Following a nearly two-hour House GOP caucus meeting Thursday, the House returned to floor and took up a motion from House Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley.

&gt;‚ÄúI move that Seat B of District 2 of the Idaho House of Representatives be declared vacant due to the disqualification pursuant to Article XI Section III of the Idaho &gt;Constitution,‚Äù Bedke said, without referring to the disqualified legislator by name or why the legislator is deemed disqualified.

&gt;With no debate, comment or discussion the House voted 65-0 to expel Green.

&gt;Earlier in the day, the Idaho Attorney General‚Äôs Office sent Bedke a letter stating that based on its review of the Idaho Constitution and state law, under Green‚Äôs felony &gt;conviction, ‚Äúhe appears to have lost his qualifications for office.‚Äù

&gt;But, the AG‚Äôs office noted, under the Constitution, the ‚ÄúHouse is the judge of the qualifications of its own members.‚Äù

&gt;This meant the House must decide whether Green is automatically removed from office, should be expelled or can retain his seat until his term expires at the end of this &gt;year.

&gt;Expelling a member from the House requires a two-thirds vote of the 70-member body.

&gt;JOHN GREEN FOUND GUILTY IN TEXAS TRIAL

&gt;A federal jury in Dallas deliberated for about three hours on Wednesday before finding Green, an attorney, and his client, Tom Selgas, guilty on all counts after a week-and-a-half trial. Green was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and Selgas was convicted of tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the U.S., The Dallas &gt;Morning News reported.
 
&gt;Green faces a five-year maximum sentence. His sentencing date has not been set.

&gt;Green is licensed to practice law in Washington state and Texas. He is not a member of the Idaho State Bar, according to bar officials.

&gt;Green has been absent from the 2020 legislative session, which convened Jan. 6, the same day his trial began.

&gt;Idaho Gov. Brad Little nominated Tim Kastning, of Rathdrum, to serve as acting state representative during Green‚Äôs temporary absence for the trial. But when a legislator‚Äôs seat becomes vacant, a different process must take place to put in a new replacement.

&gt;Green‚Äôs removal from the House is effective immediately, so the GOP committee from Green‚Äôs district has 15 days to name three possible replacements. That list will go to &gt;the governor, who then has 15 days to choose a replacement, according to state law.

&gt;That replacement will finish out the 2020 legislative session, which typically ends in late March.

&gt;All 105 Idaho legislative seats are up for election in 2020, so District 2 residents will select a new House seat B representative in the November general election.

&gt;GREEN OWES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT LEAST $134,917 IN TAXES

&gt;The IRS filed a federal tax lien against Green for $134,917 in 2014 that is still in effect, the Kootenai County Recorder‚Äôs Office said Thursday.

&gt;Whether Green has filed Idaho state tax returns or owes state taxes is not public information under Idaho law. Should the Idaho Tax Commission file a state lien against &gt;Green or pursue tax-related litigation, the information would become public.",1579212276,fel1wso

Then refused to take any responsibility for the damage that left her homeless. 

These are bad cops and cops who don't just do something like this of they know they will get in trouble for it. They won't get in trouble for it and not a single ""good cop"" is placing said bad cops in handcuffs or in the very least even speaking publicly against these actions.

1238,michaelquinlan,"Idaho View: Idaho, it‚Äôs time to ‚ÄòAdd the Words‚Äô now ‚Äî at least for workplace, housing discrimination

SCOTT MCINTOSH Idaho Statesman Jan 17, 2020

Most of us take for granted our ability to talk about our personal lives at work. We put photos of our families on our desk, we talk about what we did over the weekend with our husband or wife, and we share stories about our home life.

Yet, for some people this isn‚Äôt a possibility, because their sexual orientation or gender identity could get them discriminated against or even fired.

Idaho has long been a battleground in the call to ‚ÄúAdd the Words,‚Äù a movement that seeks to add the words ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù to the Idaho Human Rights Act, right alongside ‚Äúrace, sex, color, national origin, religion, age [over 40], mental or physical disability.‚Äù

Sen. Maryanne Jordan, D-Boise, on Tuesday introduced Add the Words legislation as a personal bill in the Senate.

But some fear that those who hold a genuine religious belief that homosexuality is wrong would be discriminated against for their beliefs.

It‚Äôs the intersection of those two concerns that was the subject of a recent Interfaith and LGBT Summit on Religious Liberty and Public Accommodations at the Idaho Capitol.

‚ÄúI sincerely believe that our LGBTQ friends should never be discriminated against, never be belittled, never be bullied. Never,‚Äù Senate President Pro Tem Brent Hill, R-Rexburg, said emphatically during his remarks at the summit. Likewise, those with religious conviction should never be discriminated against, belittled or bullied, he said.

‚ÄúIntolerance in either direction is unacceptable,‚Äù Hill said. ‚ÄúHow do we protect both sides?‚Äù

Hill said he has been working on legislation that aims to protect LGBTQ rights as well as religious freedom when it comes to the workplace, housing and public accommodations.

He told me after the summit last week that he doesn‚Äôt expect anything to happen this session, but he might introduce the bill for a print hearing, at the very least, to let the public and legislators get a look at the details.

Hill said Idaho has an opportunity to lead the nation with his legislation, which he said is even better than a widely heralded nondiscrimination law passed in 2015 in Utah.

Utah‚Äôs law prohibits discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the workplace and housing market, while also creating exemptions for religious organizations and protecting religious speech in the workplace.

Utah‚Äôs law does not address public accommodation, such as a photographer shooting a gay wedding or a baker providing a cake for a same-sex ceremony.

Hill‚Äôs legislation would address such matters, much like the federal Fairness For All Act, a recently introduced bill that has been applauded by some as a reasonable compromise and derided by others as creating too many exemptions that would allow people to discriminate against LGBTQ people based on religious beliefs.

Hill said both sides have been counting on the courts or a new president or federal legislation to give them a 100% win, and ‚Äúin the meantime, people are suffering.‚Äù

Hill is right in that respect.

Rather than try to solve the much-thornier public accommodations puzzle, Idaho should follow Utah‚Äôs lead and pass a nondiscrimination law that applies to working and housing.

Banning discrimination in the workplace and housing would address at least some of the concerns of the Add the Words proponents and begin a dialogue about public accommodation.

At last week‚Äôs summit, Idaho state Rep. John McCrostie, D-Boise, and Molly Lenty Dixon, vice president of community relations for Wells Fargo, both made convincing business cases for workplace nondiscrimination.

Both said workplace nondiscrimination policies allow workers to be their best and their whole selves at work, leading to better productivity.

Lenty Dixon said that it‚Äôs more than just a financial consideration, though.

It‚Äôs also a moral obligation.

Let‚Äôs address that moral obligation and tackle workplace and housing discrimination now.",1579377451,feto27j

&gt;# As West Coast Transplants Pour In, a Small Idaho Town Has a Big Dilemma

&gt;### Star‚Äôs population is booming and housing prices have more than doubled; ‚ÄòThe growth is beyond what people can handle‚Äô

&gt;STAR, Idaho‚ÄîWhen JT and Mary Jo Turnipseed moved to this sleepy town of 6,000, they thought they had found the perfect place to retire from the stress of Southern California. They loved the smell of mint that drifted in from the farms, how neighbors knew each other by name and the general store that reminded them of the small Iowa town where they had both grown up.

&gt;That was six years ago.

&gt;Since then, Star, about 30 minutes west of Boise, has become the fastest-growing city in Idaho‚Äîone of the fastest-growing states in the nation. Over the past nine years, Star‚Äôs population has doubled to more than 10,000. Most of the growth has come from people like the Turnipseeds who uprooted from the West Coast to the greater Boise area‚Äîknown as the Treasure Valley‚Äîdrawn by the promise of less stressful and more affordable living. By 2040, Star‚Äôs population could surpass 35,000, according to city projections.

&gt;[Change in value of single-family residences (Graph)](https://i.imgur.com/6ngGjWq.jpg)

&gt;Now Star is grappling with some of the same problems the Turnipseeds left California to escape. The town‚Äôs main drag, where ranchers once drove their cattle, is clogged with traffic during rush-hour commutes. Sprawling subdivisions have sprouted up around farmland, as have new chain stores. The median home price has more than doubled to nearly $400,000 since 2010.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre afraid that this will turn into what we left,‚Äù said Ms. Turnipseed, a retired college administrator.

&gt;Idaho was the fastest-growing state in the U.S. between July 2018 and July 2019, while the Boise metro area is among the 10 fastest-growing in the country, census figures show.

&gt;According to a September 2019 survey by Boise State University, 75% of Treasure Valley residents said that growth was occurring too fast, up from 50% in 2016.

&gt;Most of Idaho‚Äôs new residents hail from California, according to the census. A recent University of California, Berkeley, poll showed that half of the state‚Äôs registered voters have considered moving elsewhere because of the high cost of living. Three times as many Republicans as Democrats have seriously considered moving, with many citing the state‚Äôs liberal political climate, the poll said.

&gt;In Star, some transplants said the state‚Äôs conservative politics were a draw.

&gt;On a recent afternoon, Helen Collinson‚Äôs wine bar, which she has been running out of a converted 1930s-era house since 2004, was jammed with customers. She said the past year has been one of her best ever. Ms. Collinson has hired more employees, expanded her inventory and is considering moving to a larger space.

&gt;‚ÄúAs a business owner, I like more people coming in,‚Äù said Ms. Collinson, who moved from Orange, Calif., in 2003. ‚ÄúAs a resident, it‚Äôs kind of tough to see the landscape change so dramatically.‚Äù

&gt;The wave of transplants to Star, many of them retirees, has prompted officials to begin overhauling the city‚Äôs land-use codes and update its long-term plan. It is considering designating land for commercial development, hoping to attract needed services and balance its property-tax base, which relies on residences. With traffic surging, the Idaho transportation department plans to widen two sections of a road to Star from three to five lanes.

&gt;Some residents argue Star must curb development before its small-town sensibility is lost for good.

&gt;[Change in Population (Graph)](https://i.imgur.com/YZLdocj.jpg)

&gt;‚ÄúThe drum that I‚Äôve been beating is that we need to slow down, throttle back,‚Äù said Gary Smith, a former city councilor. ‚ÄúThe growth is beyond what people can handle.‚Äù

&gt;Mr. Smith, a marketing and sales consultant originally from North Bellmore, Long Island, said he fell in love with Star 14 years ago because it reminded him of home. He has since grown disenchanted with the vanishing farmland and wants a temporary moratorium on growth in the region.

&gt;Trevor Chadwick, who was sworn in as Star‚Äôs mayor this month after defeating the incumbent with 73% of the vote, said managing growth is his priority. But he said Mr. Smith‚Äôs approach would drive up home prices and property taxes because of increased demand.

&gt;Median sales prices for new and existing homes in Star have risen from $155,000 between January and November 2010 to $398,950 over the same period in 2019, according to the Boise Regional Realtors. Residents‚Äô property taxes increased by an average of between $200 and $400 this year, Mr. Chadwick said.

&gt;He said the city had no legal standing to impose a strict limit on all development.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be the first to go put a moratorium on growth, only to get sued and have to pay millions of dollars to a developer because we did them wrong,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The debate over Star‚Äôs transformation mirrors the rest of the region, as disputes in neighboring cities have erupted over whether to approve major housing developments. A public meeting in Star this week on a proposed apartment complex is expected to draw a large crowd, officials said.

&gt;This year, the Turnipseeds made an offer on a home in Crouch, Idaho. They thought the town of 180 about 50 miles northeast resembled what Star had been. They didn‚Äôt get it.

&gt;For now, the Turnipseeds don‚Äôt go out during rush hour and take back roads to get places so they can still drive through farmland.

&gt;‚ÄúPeople come here, and at some subconscious level, they want it to be that way forever,‚Äù said City Councilor Michael Keyes, himself a California transplant. ‚ÄúBut logically it can‚Äôt.‚Äù",1579637530,ff6yjtr

I have no interest in Boise, Nampa, McCall, etc, smelling like downtown Seattle (post-legalization).  If you've not been there before and after, the entire smell of the city changed - for the worse.  And that's saying something of a city with a big waterfront.

Comparisons to tobacco and alcohol miss (probably deliberately) the point that alcohol has no external smell, and tobacco is an awful lot less powerful than marijuana smoke (at least some varieties - I've been informed, repeatedly, that some smells fine, but I'm simply not familiar with it, and know that some of what I smell is quite frankly vile).

Racism is next to nonexistent. Sure, there's people that are definitely prejudice and might give you a side eye but an actual altercation is nearly never heard of, and I'm just leaving room for error.

The real prejudice from the locals is towards Californians. Not just people from the state, there's plenty of quality people moving here from there. It's the folks that leave the liberal city life of Cali, selling their modest house for millions, and buying an Idaho mansion. Then they try their hardest to change Idaho into what they most remember about Cali.
They have some good ideas they bring, but often times it is abraisive with the local culture.

Having lived in Boise most of my life, but also having lived and visited elsewhere, the near uniform ""whiteness"" of Idaho is noticeable. As the above comment relates, I think this contributes to a culture that is less racist than it is xenophobic. One thing that separates Idaho from places that aren't considered ""racist"" but definitely have ""race problems"" is that Idaho has nearly no ""colored"" areas. Everywhere is white. There aren't ""black neighborhoods."" In other places that I've been, there are very noticeable divisions between where different people live, sometimes only separated by a couple blocks. White people go to this park. Black people use this swimming pool. In those places, there is a palpable experience that someone is out of place and certain areas are set apart for the ""other."" This of course contributes to more overt racism and police being more aggressive in certain towns or suburbs and things like that.

In Idaho, I (a white person) have overheard a lot of casual racism. Mostly it seems to stem from a place of ignorance or inexperience, rather than ""I hate all those people."" It usually comes from people of older generations (though not always). I have family members who are people of color.

There are a few here and there who are racist though they usually are quietly so. They are by far a dying breed. The people I know would be enraged if they actively saw racism happening. Boise is also really safe compared to many places and the diversity is growing as boise grows. You will be around a majorly white majority. 

We have a pretty good sized refugee population and for the most part people dont care. The problems that people do seem to have with them have nothing to do with skin color or race but more to do with the government handouts. 

We also have the largest Basque community in the US(if I remember correctly). 

I left boise for 3 yrs to live near portland and for a ""tolerant"" state, that place was noticeably more racist imo.

That's not saying it didnt happen I just didnt see it. I've got coworkers who are black and some who are mexican and some who are middle eastern. I've seen one old man get frustrated with talking to the mexican once not being ""able to understand them"" cause of their accent.

I was born and raised in Idaho and have since moved all over the US and the world and seen racism (and lack thereof) of all different kinds in my life. I think that you're going to find more than your fair share of ignorance in Idaho, but I can't think of a place offhand where it'd be dangerous for you to, for example, stop and put gas in your car. There are some places in central Idaho that house some rough people with questionable views (not just about race but all kinds of subjects) but they tend to move there because they just want people to leave them the hell alone and as long as you do they'll do the same for you. And even though it can be a higher concentration than you might find elsewhere but still nowhere near the majority.  


The rest of the state is mostly okay but it's not unlikely that there will be some sort of institutional and systemic racism. You will also run into people who will say something offhanded and offensive and expect you to not be offended (oh not you of course, you're one of the *good* ones...you know the type). Even in Moscow, a liberal college town, I had friends talk about having police following them home or to gas stations and then wait for them to leave. If you're not conservative you could probably find more than your fair share of arguments there too.   


TL;DR: All of this being said most people are very friendly and well-intentioned.

Sure Boise and surrounding is getting a little more progressive just because of how population density works with political opinion, but when you think of the ""household leader"" who WANTS to move to Idaho it is not a super liberal CA vegan hipster that is moving their family to Idaho.  It is the ultra conservative ""head of household"" that wants to flee anything ""progressive""  that chooses to move their family here.  Not saying that their children and grand children are not more liberal, but you do not see that impact for a couple generations if ever.    


Unfortunately as a culture we just hate anyone from CA even though these are the ""conservative refugees"" and their families.  Also does not help that Idaho is so far to the right that moderate conservatives are ""filthy liberals"" and true liberals are hard to find.

racism is simply, treating people different because of skin color or ethnic origins. prejudice is preconceived ideas about a group of people, usually a race. 

yes, they are different ideas, but they usually go hand in hand. I believe from my own anecdotal experiences in Idaho, that there's a lot of racial prejudice here.

#About This Product

Idaho is a northwestern U.S. state known for mountainous landscapes, and vast
swaths of protected wilderness and outdoor recreation areas. The capital,
Boise, is set in the Rocky Mountain foothills and is bisected by the Boise
River, which is popular for rafting and fishing.  
  
The state covers two time zones, runs from Canada to Nevada, and encompasses
the western side of the continental divide of the Rocky Mountains. Rivers,
mountains and farmland dominate the state‚Äôs landscape. The panhandle has
emerald green hillsides, timbered mountains and pristine lakes. Central Idaho
is covered with jagged peaks. The Snake River Plain, with its wide open
vistas, irrigated farm lands and vibrant cities forms the character of
Southern Idaho.",1580168604,ffry7fz

[1] ""People of color"" is clumsy. Coloreds is succinct and sufficient. 
[2] Dictionaries are mere collections of usages, which might be wrong or right. Ask any dictionary editor.
[3] Racism is not treating people different because of skin color.

Racism means living by preventing another from trading property for property through law or through collusion because of another's race‚Äîbeing one of a people of common descent.

Property means right of ownership.  So if there is no harm to the right of ownership, there is not racism.

If I do not like rap music, wearing my pants down to my ankles, eating Cheetos, drinking grape soda or Old English 800 and smoking Kools, that does not make me a racist. My not buying crappy rap records from some guy named Jay-Z or some gal named Nicki Minaj does not make me a racist. Even if I called her Niggy Minaj, that still would not make me a racist.

If I conspired with my neighbors to run the only Polish family out of town by getting everyone to deny them work, well, that would be racist.

2040,1337shill,"Thank you for giving me information to look at. I think I have glimpsed at the first link before. The second is an extremely long and detailed paper that I did not finish.

My response to the Scientific American article is that it does not matter if race is a social construct or not. There are fairly obvious physical traits that people use in passing all of the time and are accurate most of the time. Is the term ""black"" a generalization? Sure, there is certainly variation among Africans. However, no sane person would have issues differentiating between an Asian, a black, and a European in the same room.

For more on this, [CNN's Fareed Zakaria interviewed Jared Taylor](https://go-beyond.org/decensor/info/04a446e0c69185d790a86203576c2c683aafbc8a64f7f35d815045e2a49d1e59). Fareed argues that ""white"" is not a race and that being Indian, he is as ""Aryan"" as Jared Taylor. It is an interesting discussion in my opinion and I think it elaborates effectively on this issue.

My response to the ""Human races are not like dog breeds: refuting a racist analogy,"" is that yes, humans are not bred nearly as selectively as dogs. I do not understand the genetic markers enough to be able to intelligently compare the range of human DNA to dog DNA. However, I think the dog analogy is fair in explaining that there are physical and neurological differences consistent within a species. It may be a magnified view not representative of human beings, but it does illustrate the point. Border Collies exhibit different intelligence and behavior than Corgies, for instance. Whether one is better than another is debatable, but they are different.

If race is a social construct, have you ever heard anyone arguing that the world's fastest runners are not black? Maybe the semantics are incorrect in some way, but I think we understand eachother. Someone of predominantly African descent. Barring albinism, with notably darker skin tone than those of European descent. I do understand that there are many groups of people who don't fit into obvious immediate categories. Perhaps some Mongolians and some Polynesians. Even the term Hispanic varies considerably, somehow applying to both Spaniard descendents and Mestizos even though they look very different.

Nonetheless, beyond the obvious physical traits I do believe there are common differences between ""races"". Again, as a rule of thumb. IQ and many features are distributed on a bellcurve.

 Here is a [combination of map overlays with IQ, rape, homicide, and skin tone data](https://go-beyond.org/decensor/info/7445187ca118aa8c8498fdf9de906efd9146e97d665a81fc158d8ce1b26dd90d). It is cited if you wish to see if any of the sources are questionable.

Freedomain Radio has a great number of talks specifically on IQ. If you're curious, you can go [here](https://www.freedomain.com/all-podcasts/) and search for IQ. I listened to one of them a while back and can find the specific episode if you are curious. Basically, in identical twin studies, both twins, regardless of economic circumstance, family environment, tended to end up roughly in the same place in life. There was variation but not much, I think the average was within 5 IQ points or something like that. Higher IQ directly correlates with non-violence and success. If the factors in the studies varied wildly, it would indicate no genetic link to intelligence and other factors.

Here is an [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24326626) on a gene directly linked to shooting and stabbing frequency. The gene is present most often in Africans. It seems to be paywalled, I might be able to find a copy if you are interested.

My personal understanding is that the environment in which Europeans and Asians lived in for thousands of years was substantially different than the environment in which Africans adapted to. Africa is incredibly resource rich with an abundance of good soil and water (not in all regions, of course), and does not require considerable planning to survive through a cold, harsh winter. The cold winters and lack of food crops Europeans had to endure meant that anyone lacking the ability to plan, defer gratification, and stock up for the winter simply died off. In time, this selected for more intelligent Europeans to continue breeding. Africans did not have that particular agent of natural selection and are different as a result.",1580256095,ffv5f5r

2042,enolic2000,"I appreciate the long response, but you really haven‚Äôt provided any substance, except for you insisting that there are differences of the races.  You are literally using erroneous info that was used by racists for many decades to support their actions to keep minorities as slaves or in poverty.   But I believe it goes deeper than that, and so does science.  I really don‚Äôt believe there will be anything that I could provide that would change your way of  viewing racism as an acceptable form of behavior.    So I‚Äôm not going to go point for point with you, because you will never believe it and just dismiss it, like you did for what I already provided.    

Please realize that you are saying that white people are better, just because they look different.   No statistic at all supports that, when you take into account any social construct that has been imposed upon minorities throughout history.   It is like saying that black people are dumber, but society doesn‚Äôt allow primarily black schools to be funded probably enough to operate effectively.  No shit those test scores would be lower.  They aren‚Äôt being taught the same things. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that they are dumber, it means that they weren‚Äôt allowed to play the same game as white people.",1580261476,ffvddlu
2043,1337shill,"Likewise, I also appreciate your long response.

I think slavery was a terrible idea and do not support it or justify it. However, pointing the finger at whites for slavery and dimissing that most slave owners were African (or Middle Eastern) and is a bit biased.

Right now I'm reading Basic Economics, a book by a black man, Thomas Sowell. I think it's fantastic and he's an extremely smart guy.

I don't think that school funding matters much. There's more opportunities for education now than ever. Anyone can go online and learn anything from medical information to nuclear reactors. Even aside from that, there are numerous libraries. And people who show curiousity tend to get picked up by mentors as mentors want people to interact with. I spent fairly little time in school and was partly homeschooled. I did not go to college. I taught myself much of what I know today instead of playing video games.

I understand your compassionate perspective. I believed it for many years. You should believe what makes the most sense to you. I never wanted to think that people were different. I wanted to think that everything was merit and opportunity based. Now, I can only wish that were true. I would encourage you to only entertain the idea in your mind (not accept it) that people are different and some are notably more or less capable than others. Maybe in some cases it will make sense to you. Maybe it will reaffirm what you already believe if you see it being more absurd the more you consider it.

Trying to understand my own disposition has helped me understand myself a lot. A lot of strengths and weaknesses tie together and have fairly interesting mental avenues. Someone's ability to focus is also their addictive personality. And another's inability to focus is their ability to give up on bad ideas more easily and try other options.

Perhaps, systemic oppression is the answer to everything and it's only that people are oppressed which keeps them down. It has nothing to do with their behavior or their nature. Maybe the Africans still living in mud huts, thousands of years behind every other race, just have different abilities and priorities largely dictated by their genetics. Or maybe it's oppression.

If you are curious, which I doubt you are at this point and I can't blame you, I have a video that talks about [slavery and black oppression](https://go-beyond.org/post/martin-luther-king-jr/).

For the record, I don't think I'm the smartest person around. Asians tend to be smarter than whites (though part of the statistical reason for that is that Japan does not count retarded people in its IQ reporting). I'm not as fast as most black men. I can't handle rice as well as Asians. And I won't live as long as someone shorter than myself (the number one physical indicator of longevity is height -- the taller you are the shorter you live).

I don't wish blacks ill, but many are not capable of integrating into western society. Big cites have more crime than smaller towns, but especially so in areas with majority black population. This is the case over and over. Compared to other minorities (and I say that in reference to the US, not globally), blacks are [far more violent](https://go-beyond.org/decensor/info/0298bbeead16a842b48333fddeaa1a759f46eabe6ee864a8abbfd7d61ed57a7b).

I also don't think it's good to forget that there were quite a number of Chinese slaves in the US. Hardly anyone ever talks about that. They integrated into society and rose with everyone else, ahead of many. Much of that is the culture, but I think a lot of culture also comes from genetic disposition (focus, intelligence, deferred gratification, sensitivity, aggresion).",1580265427,ffvj9qt

Above all the main issue is Focus yes Focus. The thing about African Americans is people ONLY focus on the negatives. They love to show the negatives. I'm not sure if you have been to southern Ohio where I mentioned I am from but I think you should take a visit to educate yourself. On top of that I would suggest you read ""Hillbilly Elegy"" by J.D Vance. Have you been keeping up with Joe Burrows mentioning the poverty in southern Ohio? Of course you haven't. Poverty only happens to black people. Failing schools only happen to black people. Drugs users are only black people. Well let me tell you what.

&gt;  It is has nothing to do with IQ but everything to do with resources and geography.

In that case, Africa should be at the top of the list.

&gt; Also, if IQ where so cut and dry than how on earth do you explain the slums of India? Yet, almost every doctor you meet in the U.S is Indian.

I have not encountered many Indian doctors. But I have worked with Indians in tech, and yes, some are very smart. There's a few things here.

 * Universities offering abroad programs. I don't know much about this, but it seems to be a thing. There are many more scholarships for non-white-Americans than white Americans. This is where much of the education comes from. It seems like universities encourage people to come abroad quite a bit.
 * The Indians who *do* make it to the US are not the average Indians. They are the smartest and brightest India has to offer. This makes Indians appear more intelligent than if you actually go there. This goes for basically all immigration to the US except for refugee programs.

And for the record, Ghandi is famous for saying that Indians are superior to Africans. I think many Indians have comparable IQs to East Asians and Europeans, albeit a bit lower on average. While I don't think I'd like to live in India, I am generally fond of Indians. Of course it also varies notably from North to South.

&gt; How do you explain Gypsy's in Europe? Yes, Gypsy's are of Indian decent .

Yeah, Gypsies are absolutely despised by most. I have been to Romania. They threw firecrackers at me. Gypsies lie and steal and don't assimilate with the rest of the culture. Some do, sure, but then they're not so much considered Gypsy. I think they are lower IQ (I would guess lower than most other Indians) and seem to perpetuate their behavior with their culture. Romanians hate Gypsies in part because they give the rest of their country a bad name as people sometimes think ""Gypsy"" when they hear Romanian.

&gt; You do realize that people from Nigeria come to the U.S to become doctors at a significantly higher rate than African Americans. If everyone from Africa is low IQ please explain to me that relationship.

Nigerians may be one of the smartest African groups which could put them ahead of the average African American. Also, the same thing about Indians applies here. There is a bellcurve and there's going to be some very smart Nigerians who will be fine doctors and make it over. I am not sure how the African American population compares to the Nigerian population, but that may be part of it.

I also think political changes in the US have impacted how blacks do in the US. They were doing much better 50 years ago. More stable families, higher income, and lower crime. Blacks were also statistically doing better before 1964, believe it or not.

&gt; Let's say you are walking down the street. How would you personally identify between a group of people racially who are dark skinned from the following countries Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Australia,Kenya and Sri Lanka?

I can identify some of them but likely not most accurately. None of them are particularly high IQ to my knowledge, especially the Australian Aboriginees.

I've been to Ohio, there's a lot of whites there in poverty as well. Even some very smart ones.

What even is a minority to you? Whites are a minority worldwide and are dying out.

The only place you'll really deal with traffic is the Treasure Valley (Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell) &amp; even then at its worst from one end to the other (Caldwell to downtown Boise) your looking at an 1 1/2 - 2 hours (unless there's an accident, then you're screwed).
The whole state gets cold &amp; snowy to some degree during the winter, but it can really vary (multiple ft of snow &amp; negative temps - a couple inches &amp; in the teens). The T.V. has the mildest winters &amp; is the most populated (has the most job opportunities), but is sadly being over run by CA immigrants which has started to kill the ""community"" aspect of the region. 
The wildlife is abundant; there are deer, elk, moose, bears, coyotes, fox, wolves, &amp; mountain lions etc. pretty much everywhere.  Recently there has been a bunch of mt. lion attacks on pets (in the  T.V., McCall &amp; Sun Valley areas) but otherwise if you are smart &amp; keep your distance the wildlife will basically leave you alone.  
The job prospects depend on what you're wanting &amp; willing to do, but we do have a pretty low unemployment rate &amp; it seems like everyone is hiring.  
As for land, we have a lot of it but the location you're looking at will really affect the price tag.

2140,clandestineblaze,"I moved here from Vermont a couple years ago.  Unfortunately, the answer to almost all of your questions is ‚Äúit depends.‚Äù  If you‚Äôre moving from a place like Williston to a place like McCall, there will be a lot less traffic and a lot more snow here than what you got in Vermont.  On the other hand, if you‚Äôre moving from Island Pond to Boise, there will be a lot less snow, much warmer winters, and a hell of a lot more traffic than what you‚Äôre used to.  

The Treasure Valley area probably has the most in the way of job opportunities for people from out of state, but it is also the most different from Vermont out of everywhere I‚Äôve been in the state.  Things are a lot more convenient here.  For example, I used to have to drive over an hour to find a dentist that was taking patients, whereas here they‚Äôre all over the place.  There are tons of movie theaters around (although lots of people here will talk during movies for some reason, which is something I didn‚Äôt see as much in Vermont).  There are tons of different restaurants with different kinds of food - stuff I couldn‚Äôt get in Vermont like Vietnamese, decent Mexican, or decent barbecue.  The state parks system here is really good and fees are a lot less expensive than in Vermont.  We‚Äôre fairly close to a lot of pretty spectacular mountains and forests, but in the Treasure Valley itself there are very few trees, which is a little hard to get used to at first.  Traffic here is much worse than what I was used to, but road surfaces are generally in much better shape.  

You probably will not be able to find a house with an acre or more of land for a reasonable price anywhere close to jobs here.  The pattern of settlement is much different than in Vermont, where you have all these small but spread-out towns where a lot of houses have a few acres of land.  Here a lot of land is locked up either as farms/ranches or as federal government land.  Towns tend to be a lot farther apart but much denser.  In the Treasure Valley, you‚Äôll mostly find a lot of subdivisions or housing developments, most of which aren‚Äôt particularly quaint or charming, unfortunately.  

I wouldn‚Äôt take some of the comments about people here being worse than people in Vermont too seriously.  I think people here tend to be much friendlier than a lot of people in Vermont can be (especially if you are not a Vermont native).  There are a lot of people in this subreddit and /r/Boise who either really don‚Äôt want people moving here or who don‚Äôt seem to like living here all that much, so don‚Äôt let that kind of stuff discourage you.  But do understand that it is a different place than what you‚Äôre used to, and that you might not find what you‚Äôre expecting when/if you come out here.

if you do Boise your first question coming in will be WERE are the TREES. seriously its a desert. Even going to MCall will not be the same. It is dryer here, the humidity is almost none existent. you have a lot more public land and have access to a lot of wildlife, but its not the Adirondacks. Idaho is isolated. think more northern Maine. You have to drive far to get to interesting places like 5 hours minimum. ( seattle , portland , saltlake,) Traveling out of Idaho is a Bitch and you will have to be independent the more remote you go. This is what i find the hardest for people to understand. there are places were there are no big box stores. and there are a lot of places that are 24/7 stores, and there are a lot of places that dont have amenities people are use too. Also if you are planing on kids Idaho is a save place for them to grow up, but the education is lacking and your kids will have a harder time competing with the world. 

If i were moving from Vermont, i would try sandpoint ( forest), stanley ( mountain), silver city ( desert), Moscow (Palouse). Those areas have a great environment ( no jobs) ( land is pricey).

Excellent place to raise a child and the university is definitely an asset to the community. I'm a recent U of I grad, so being around college students is alright by me, you might not like that as much. About 1.5 hours to Spokane airport.

CDA is close enough to the Spokane airport. Not sure about schools, but the lake and mountains are close by as well as many outdoor activities within a close drive. Also closer to Seattle, if you ever like to get away to a large city for a bit. Downside is they're experiencing similar growth to Boise, so be aware.

Other than that, the only city that has an airport is Lewiston. Some people love it, but I think I would be driven out by the paper plant and it's not quite as close to good outdoor stuff. Maybe someone who actually lived there can add on to my comments.",1580421528,fg166jk

I've received numerous briefings prior to entering Persia regarding Men and Boys and the fact they can wed girls at the age of eight.  

I've seen, as have you, countless stories, articles and investigative TV related to Catholic Priests.

I've seen, as have you, countless stories, articles and investigative TV related to Mormon Scout Leaders.

It's my opinion that these three sects have something very dark in common.  

It's very clear in the moslem religion.  A man cannot have pre-marital sex.  It is a great sin.  However, he can take a young boy as a ""Companion"".  And, he can marry a girl as young as 8 and take her into his harem as his wife.

With Mormons, we have Polygamy. Perhaps the Mormon man's inability to legally have polygamy has driven him to molesting boys at Scout Camp.

Catholic Priests:  It seems to me they're a special sect who have taken it upon themselves to believe the Quran regarding a life of celibacy and a perceived permission to molest little boys.

I see a lot of wildlife, but I hike and no, I do not go out during hunting season as there's so many idiots that will shoot people wearing orange and I don't think the risk is worth it.

I am not a vegan either, perhaps you are the close minded one? I see a balance that is completely upset due to hunting. Wildlife also extremely difficult lives in the elements dealing with starvation and drought in a lot of years and every day is a struggle for survival.

I don't feel that bad eating animals that are ethically raised. They live the easy life in exchange for becoming our food.

2272,stayarmed,"I never said that it was surprising, you are the one who seemingly thought everyone easily finds an animal to shoot, you said its remarkably easy in fact. The stats show otherwise.

Hunting accidents account for a tiny number of firearms injuries, so that shouldn't be a worry for you at all [source](http://abolishsporthunting.org/how-safe-is-hunting-by-young-people-see-the-statistics-from-c-a-s-h-committee-to-abolish-sport-hunting/), [second source](https://www.thoughtco.com/hunting-accident-rates-127877). I also have trouble believing that you check to see if you're in an active hunting zone/season or not, as you seem to know nothing about the subject. 

I am close minded for asking if you're a vegan? Please explain your thought process there. Unless you only eat free range chicken/eggs, and free range grass fed beef, you are contributing to a market that treats animals like shit. A huge portion of the meat sold in stores has not been ethically raised. The beef industry poses a huge threat to the climate, so even if you eat beef from the most ethical farms in the world you're still contributing to climate change. This in turn, hurts the wild animal population, and the rest of the living world. 

Most wild animals that are hunted live a much better life than produce animals anyways. Lawful hunting and conservation directly help the wild animal population, through funding. I'm not some backwoods guy who thinks hunting licenses and permits are stupid. You're equating all hunters as equal which is not the case, look up people like Steven Rinella and try and see some good. If not, I don't care, hunting isn't going away anytime soon.",1580554699,fg65iii

All you licenses and fees do is go towards dealing with the ramifications of hunting in the first place. If it was left more wild we would see a balance that requires very little hunting. But hey, because I don't hunt, I couldn't possibly understand.

2290,katrina1215,"&gt;The oldest son of a mother at the center of a missing children's case is pleading with her to do ""everything you can to fix this."" 

&gt;Colby Ryan made the tearful plea Friday, just one day after Lori Vallow failed to bring her 7-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter, who have not been seen since September, to authorities in Idaho. 

&gt;Authorities believe Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow and Tylee Ryan are in danger, and that Vallow knows either where they are or what has happened to them.

&gt;""I want you to step up more than anything in the world,"" Ryan said in a video posted to YouTube. ""Step up and just do the right thing.""

&gt;Ryan, in his early 20s and Vallow's son from her second of five marriages, said he held out hope Thursday that there would be some answers to the mysterious case. 

&gt;When Vallow didn't show with the children, he said: ""it just made everything worse."" 

&gt;Vallow, who lived in Rexburg, Idaho, until leaving in November 2019, was spotted in Hawaii over the weekend with her husband of three months, Chad Daybell. The children were not with them and police believe they were never in Hawaii. 

&gt;Vallow was ordered to bring the children to either the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare or Rexburg police by early evening Thursday. She did not do so and may now be subject to civil or criminal contempt of court, according to police, though it is not clear what penalties she may face.

&gt;The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is conducting an investigation into the children's safety and has up until Feb. 10 to deliver a report the court, according to a copy of the child protection order obtained by ABC News. If and when the children are located, they will be placed in the custody of the state agency and then appointed a guardian, according to the order. 

&gt;""I feel like I've just lost everything in such a short amount of time,"" Ryan said.

&gt;In a message directed at Vallow, he told her that he loves her no matter what and just wants to see JJ and Tylee. 

&gt;""I love you 'cause you're my mom, but at the end of the day I'm still in the same spot. Everybody's still in the same spot with no answers,"" he said. 

&gt;Ryan spoke emotionally about the children and their lives. 

&gt;Of Tylee, Ryan said, ""I know that you've had to do a lot of stepping up and I'm so sorry you didn't get to just have that normal school, friends and everything."" 

&gt;He called JJ ""so smart"" and ""so beautiful."" 

&gt;""I miss playing with you. I miss spending time with you,"" Ryan said.

&gt;Ryan also thanked Charles Vallow, Lori Vallow's former husband and the adopted father of JJ, who was shot and killed by her brother, Alex Cox. 
 
&gt;""I just want to thank you for being there for our family when we needed you,"" he said. ""You stepped up so fast. You took us all in."" 

&gt;Alex Cox fatally shot Charles Vallow in July 2019, police said. Police are looking at the case as self-defense that stemmed from an altercation between the two inside Lori Vallow's then-Chandler, Arizona home.

&gt;Cox was then found unresponsive in his Gilbert, Arizona, home in December 2019. He was later pronounced dead, and a spokesperson for Gilbert police previously told ABC News the department still was waiting for autopsy results to determine the cause. 

&gt;In between Vallow and Cox's death, Chad Daybell's wife also died under circumstances now believed to be suspicious, authorities said. 

&gt;The bewildering case, including rumors of a cult affiliation, has offered few answers and the next steps for Lori Vallow remain unclear. 

&gt;She and Daybell were last seen in Hawaii Wednesday afternoon local time.",1580585454,fg76z37

We've had for the last couple years a few individuals that moved from California who are very adamant about instituting fines for the rules. Thankfully the majority are against it. I guess it's fine though. Anyone can present an idea as long as everyone gets to vote on it. 


The real problem is that one of the individuals parks in front of everyone's property with binoculars for minutes at a time looking for violations. I haven't seen him do it since after the last meeting though. I bunch of people brought it up and were, to put it nicely unhappy.

Overall I'd say my experience has been good. Most everyone that I've met has moved here because it more closely aligns with their values. Even the people I don't agree with have been pleasant individuals. I've only met a couple people that I know are from California that I genuinely disliked.

Best case scenario is that a state like California figures out how to capture those with pensions who move away from California, and then those inbound states figure out how to tax that money (or their property) as well. 

Of course, we don't want to ""tax grandma out of her home,"" but we also don't need thousands of wealthy retirees coming here and taking advantage of the state, while also voting to avoid paying any taxes whatsoever to help fund the growth here.",1580747725,fgfu8n8
2450,Bay2NPS2NFS2BLM2Sac,"As a Californian, the issues are housing, housing, housing, housing, and housing. Everything else is secondary. And it all comes back to housing really. It's the main driving for squeezing the working and middle class and the high cost of living.

Income tax is on a pretty progressive scale and doesn't get too bad until you're solidly upper middle class. Property tax is totally dependent on when you bought your home. If you're just buying, it's terrible, even if it's capped at 1%. If you bought a long time ago, it can easily be significantly less than what it would be in another state because Prop 13 means your home can't be reassessed and the max increase is 2% a year, which is less than the average inflation rate. There are a ton of Californians who pay virtually nothing on homes worth a million. Trump getting rid of the SALT deductions, recent buyers are particularly fucked. California also does tax capital gains, which is a common form of retirement income. Moving can save on income tax for retirees, but a low assessment can mean that moving will cost you more in property taxes.

Sales tax is high, but groceries are included. I'd assume that because of that I pay about the same here as I do in California.

I don't deny the quality of life issues that come from the homeless crisis, but most of the state outside of specific neighborhoods in major cities are mostly unaffected.

Whackadoodle laws like the straw thing don't really affect people.

2455,88Anchorless88,"Growth increases public budgets, but spending increases at the same time.  I think you can look to many other growing states' budgets, examine their revenues v. expenditures, and then look at the situation on the street, and come to your own conclusions.  Strongtown has done an expose on this, titled ""The Growth Ponzi Scheme.""  You should read it; its fascinating. 

We are already allocating a decent amount toward conservation through various levies and program work.  With growth comes not only more people, and more pressure on public and common resources, but higher land values and pressure to develop those lands, rather than leave them undeveloped or put into conservation easements. 

Who cares if growth attracts a ""high talent"" workforce.  What about people here in the state that increasingly cannot find work, or work that pays even a living wage?  We don't need more skilled labor; we need more committed, home-grown employers who won't bounce when the next low-cost of living state comes along with a handsome suite of tax incentives.  We need to invest in the people in our state already, and train them to be high skilled workers. 

Art and culture is what we make it.  Boise and other Idaho towns have always done their own thing.  Either you support local art and artists or you don't.  But sure, a growing town brings in more cultural opportunities.  Neato.

My argument is quite simple and plain:  take a look around.  You can see the impacts growth has had elsewhere.  Pick a place.  Then you can start to pick the beneficial and negative consequences of growth.  When I look at things like affordability, housing stability, housing access, traffic and traffic congestion, general cost of living, taxes, access to the outdoors, environmental impacts, trail access and impacts, congestion in our public lands and public spaces, stakeholder conflicts, pollution, etc., it becomes quite plain and simple to me that growth has more of a negative impact than a positive impact.  

If you've been in the Boise area for over 10 or 15 years, but even longer, you can see this play out in real time.  The data unequivocally prove that to be the case.  The anxiety and gnashing of teeth, the elections and mandates that come from them... all bear that out. 

Its embarrassing that you don't acknowledge this, and that you think I'm an embarrassment for pointing it out.  It makes me think that you only stand to gain personally from the growth here, fuck everyone else.",1580757044,fgg9cdj
2456,88Anchorless88,"Yawn.  This is such a recycled argument. 

I agree, change zoning for dense development.  But then Meridian, Eagle, Nampa, Caldwell, Kuna, Star, Middleton, Emmett, and Horseshoe Bend still grow and sprawl anyway.  None of those towns, save maybe Meridian, are poised for the type of dense development that Boise necessitates; they just aren't far enough along the growth cycle yet.   

So while Boise becomes more dense, everywhere else sprawls and really nothing changes.  Downtown Boise is continues to be more expensive, and that downtown development is bought up as speculation property, to used as a second or third home, or just left vacant, like we've seen in NYC, Seattle, SF, LA, Vancouver, Portland, etc.  Or else its bought up by rich retirees or tech bros moving here.  Either way, probably doesn't help with affordable housing for the people who need it.

(By the way, Eagle just voted out their pro-dense mayor and city council for a pro-sprawl, pro-estate lot mayor and councilpersons)

The state of Idaho has no legal mechanism for funding public transportation; got to change that at the state level.  Guess how long that's going to take, given the makeup of our state legislature?

We already have buses people can ride.  They choose not to.  How bad do the roads have to get, and how much improvement does the bus system have to undergo, for more people to ride them?

I agree we have to plan for growth.  Other cities have planned for growth in different ways.  They've all failed.   Some have tried restrictive land use and urban growth boundaries (Portland, OR); others have tried laissez faire land use regulation and infinite sprawl (Phoenix, Houston).   The latter are more affordable than the former; but traffic and congestion in the latter is absolutely terrible.  Pick your poison.",1580757634,fggab5k

Cops had gunned down militia member LaVoy Finicum during the armed occupation of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. 
Washington state Rep. Matt Shea visited Malheur during the occupation, and now at this gathering in Stevens County the following June, he's leading a roundtable titled ""You Should Be Scared,"" warning the crowd that what happened to Finicum could happen to them. 
""That could be any single one of us that just says 'no' one day,"" the Republican Spokane Valley legislator says. ""Any single one of us!"" 
But then Shea introduces one of the reasons he's hopeful: The ""finest legislator of the state of Idaho,"" a woman who ""has people so scared in Idaho that even the speaker now is afraid to have her in his office."" 
""Representative Heather Scott, get up here!"" Shea yells, and the crowd whistles and cheers. 
Scott, a small woman with long brown hair and just a hint of Holly Hunter in her voice, tells the crowd that some people think Idaho is safe because it's dominated by Republicans. 
""No, we're not safe,"" Scott says. ""We're allowing refugees into our state. Last week, we lit up our Capitol with rainbow colors."" 
She used to be complacent, she says. A few years earlier, she didn't know anything about politics or even bother to vote. A message from God changed all that. 

The entire article is a good read, but I think this illustrates that these people are insane.",1581100448,fgt76pc

&gt;Heather Scott knows how to make a first impression. 
During Scott's very first week in office in 2015, representing the northernmost part of Idaho, from Sandpoint up, fellow lawmakers watched her climb on her new desk in Boise and ask them if the little black object hanging from the wire on the ceiling could be a ""listening device."" She then pulled out a knife and cut it down.

It is health insurance for all, but the health insurance is amazing. It covers almost everything with no out of pocket expenses, copays, or deductibles. The medical provider would still bill Medicare for whatever they do, but Medicare would most definitely cover the cost. Of course, there would be exceptions for coverage. 

There are times where you have to try certain medications or procedures prior to others. As an example: Medicare says that you have to try Medication A before B, and B before C. If your provider thinks you should skip A and try B then they have to have it authorized prior to starting the medication. If you want to take C, but have not tried both A and B, then you would pay out of pocket. This can be helpful because if Medications A,B,and C are all competing to be on the formulary then they will decrease their cost. If company for Medication B decides to decrease the cost of B, then Medicare will pick a new order of B, A, then C. This will drastically reduce the cost for prescription medications.",1581360778,fh8j1kl

You can't claim to hold one person to a standard, and than turn around and keep you mouth shut for another doing the same things.

Obama promised quite a few things, and fell flat. We were still in the Middle East in force, Gitmo is still open, unemployment continued to rise, our defict skyrocketed, his administration blamed a movie for an attack on an Embassy and did nothing to protect our citizens there.

Bernie has ZERO legislative accomplishments in the US Senate. But somehow morons like you believe he is going to 535 floor voting members of Congress to throw out of work hundreds of thousands of people with new law that will transform 17% of the economy?

R-e-t-a-r-d-e-d is what you are. 

If you were smart, which you are not, you would be advocating for the elimination of Medicaid (free-to-them medicine for bums) and Medicare (free-to-them medicine for oldersters) since Congress spends $6.50 of every $10 on medicine and thus puts a price floor on every medical product sold.

Medicine would be cheap with most of it paid by out-of-pocket if government were not involved in it at all.

&gt; **Idaho lawmakers killed a bill on public land access last week. Now they‚Äôve resurrected it**
&gt; 
&gt; BY NICOLE BLANCHARD
&gt; FEBRUARY 10, 2020 03:32 PM 
&gt; 
&gt; A popular road in the Boise Foothills used by hunters and other recreationists has been closed to the public as the billionaire Wilks brothers continue to exert their private-property rights in Idaho. BY CHADD CRIPE
&gt; For the second time in a week, Idaho lawmakers considered introducing legislation that aimed to improve access to public land. For the first time, they voted to move it forward.
&gt; 
&gt; The Senate Resources and Environment Committee on Monday voted to print a bill that would mean fines for people who knowingly block public land access.
&gt; 
&gt; Sen. Fred Martin, R-Boise, sponsored the legislation Monday. Last Wednesday, the House Resources and Conservation committee swiftly voted down printing a comparable bill, which was sponsored by Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise.
&gt; 
&gt; If a person knowingly blocks access to public land, the first violation is a warning. A second violation in two years warrants an infraction and $200 fine, while a third violation would be a misdemeanor carrying a $1,000 fine. No jail time is associated with the bill.
&gt; 
&gt; The proposal also would allow individuals to file a civil suit if they can show proof of damages.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúLaw enforcement doesn‚Äôt have the resources to address these disputes,‚Äù Martin told the committee.
&gt; 
&gt; It‚Äôs not the first time Martin has raised the issue with the Resources and Environment Committee. During the 2019 session, he sponsored a more broad version of the bill, which was drafted by the Idaho Wildlife Federation, a local conservation nonprofit. The 2019 bill got some traction in the Senate committee, though it eventually died there.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time, some legislators echoed concerns from the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, Idaho Cattle Association and representatives for DF Development, a company owned by Texas billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks, that the bill would open landowners up to constant litigation.
&gt; 
&gt; Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, and Sen. Bert Brackett, R-Rogerson, raised the same issues on Monday. Brackett said it‚Äôs a serious endeavor for landowners to try to match longtime fencing with updated GPS property boundaries.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúMany fence lines are not on property lines,‚Äù Brackett said. ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt when they were put in 100 years ago, and they‚Äôre still not. ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where my fence lines are, many of them.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview following the committee hearing, Martin told the Statesman he‚Äôs sensitive to the legislators‚Äô concerns.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúFor lots of Idahoans, access to public land is extremely important,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúNow the balance is the agricultural industry has some legitimate concerns that their private property (won‚Äôt be) illegitimately crossed. Sen. Brackett did a good job of saying, ‚ÄòHey, I‚Äôm concerned.‚Äô ‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; **PUBLIC LAND ACCESS REMAINS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR IDAHOANS**
&gt; Though Martin‚Äôs district is a suburban one, he said his constituents are proponents of public land access. The senator said it‚Äôs perhaps one of the top issues in his district behind education and property taxes.
&gt; 
&gt; Idaho Wildlife Federation Executive Director Brian Brooks said it‚Äôs heartening to have the senator‚Äôs support following the bill‚Äôs defeat in the House. Last week, Brooks told the Statesman he didn‚Äôt think public land access would be addressed in the 2020 session. He was taken by surprise when Martin expressed interest in reviving the legislation.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúSomebody is listening,‚Äù Brooks said in a phone interview Monday. ‚ÄúSen. Martin said, ‚ÄòThis is a really good bill.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm relieved that there‚Äôs bipartisan support for it.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Martin cited Boise Ridge Road as an example of a situation he hopes the legislation can prevent. In 2018, the Wilks brothers gated the popular road in the Boise Foothills because it crosses land owned by their DF Development company. Critics said the road is a public right-of-way with a longstanding easement.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThere is an honest dispute in respect to that road, whether it‚Äôs public or private,‚Äù Martin said, noting that the gate is currently open.
&gt; 
&gt; Though the Wilks have drawn much of the public ire over access, a 2019 study found millions of acres of public land inaccessible. Martin said the problem is widespread across Idaho.
&gt; 
&gt; He hopes the legislation could serve as a catalyst for landowners to keep access available.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThe main thing is it does set up an avenue for dispute through the court system,‚Äù Martin said.",1581440685,fhbel1u
3113,AtOurGates,"Well, not about the fines, but it does give local law enforcement clearer ground to enforce public access, and citizens standing to sue for damages.  

I'm not sure how you show damages for ""couldn't get to my favorite local hiking trail"", but perhaps a class action from all the citizens who were blocked?",1581440753,fhbep3q

If you want to argue that records aren't accurate, and haven't been for 100 years, then who's to say that you actually ""own"" that property at all? You and/or the county need to pay for having the property lines re-surveyed, re-mapped, and re-fenced.

However, the small ranchers could potentially suffer because that fine is no small potatoes to them.

Next, barely any bills are being brought to the floor because Republican senators refuse to do their jobs. And let me guess, you want to pass Trump‚Äôs presidency as a success even though he has created less jobs than the previous president, has ran up the debt, hasn‚Äôt reformed healthcare, hasn‚Äôt built a wall that Mexico will pay for, and continues to fill the swamp? So frankly I could care less what you would find successful for a presidency. 

You may want to look up the definition of single-payer because it means the government (a single payer) would pay providers. So yes, nationalized healthcare would accurately be called singe-payer. 

So the vast-majority of advanced nations make guaranteed healthcare work but you don‚Äôt think we can? You don‚Äôt think we are a good enough nation to do so? What do you think is worse: waiting several months for an MRI or not getting one at all because you can‚Äôt afford to? There is a reason no countries are trying to switch back to private healthcare. Everyone is healthy until they aren‚Äôt. Being healthy and not needing to use your health insurance is great until you are struck with a medical emergency that leaves you in medical debt and/or bankrupt. 

Anyways, I see you are still triggered by this topic to the point of continuing petty insults. Looks like you must not be one of the ‚Äúhealthy people‚Äù that would be burdened as it appears you could use access to anger management, therapy, and medications to help calm you and work out your issues.

Yes, clients will cancel at last minute and you will likely have to work outside of your normal work schedule all the time to make the hours up so you can pay your own bills. Kid clients mean you work after school so later evenings, too. Paperwork is not billable time at least it wasnt for me so mastering writing your notes while billing is challenging but possible. You will spend a lot of time in your car, libraries, coffee shops, anywhere that is free so ypu arent always in someones home. You might alao be sitting in someones filthy home motivating them to clean some dishes or either ADLs. I had one kid client I tried to motivate to complete hygiene tasks before school. Mileage was partially reimbursed but I had to drive to clients from downtown Boise to the northeast edge of Meridian, to Kuna all in one day and I could barely afford to drive when gas prices were high.
Without higher education I wouldn't expect there to be a career progression.

Prices there are not too bad and it is a small, rural community and really quite nice and still unsullied for the most part. Still, the Boise area is a backwater compared to most metro areas and while there are issues, the rat race is more of a mouse race.

I want to make a point about Idaho that is very important. It is probably the most progressive taxation state there is. You pay no income tax on a large portion of your income and actually get money back in the form of the Food Tax Credit. You also get up to $100,000 in homeowner exemption on your property taxes for your primary residence. This is a huge deal for lower-income people. Another part is if you are disabled you can get a complete property tax exemption. Washington is the most tax regressive state in the country by some calculations (thank you Microsoft, etc.). If you are low income in Idaho you pay very little tax compared to most states. 

Progressive in this case means high-income people pay more tax than lower-income people. Regressive means the opposite.",1581706331,fhlyz1e

What ever rout you take:

Slow down, it's better to be late than never arive.

Do not use cruise control if their is snow or if the temps get into the low 30's or below. 

Make calm smooth turns and lane changes (use your blinker).

Back up, do not tailgate, in good weather allow 3-5 seconds between you and the car you are following. In rain, snow, freezing weather give yourself 5-7 seconds. More reaction time, more time to slow down.

Every once in a while you will see a sign that says ""tune to #### am/fm for weather update"" . The highway department's don't put those signs up for fun, they put them up to help travelers have the most up-to-date information about road conditions. It's worth a listen.

Lastly I will say this is probably the most important one. Stay off of your phone, keep distractions to a minimum and pay attention to the road and cars around you.

3459,tehcoma,"I would contend you have zero experience with the financial side of health care. 

The CMS (seemingly) arbitrary sets reimbursement rates for the care received by patients. For example, the payment from Medicare for an ambulance ride may be only $350, total. But the base cost of providing that service is say $550, or more. That $550 is just the cost of salaries and equipment maintenance. It doesn‚Äôt account for the need to buy new ambulances, raises for staff, or fund growth. 

So, to fund the delta, medical providers have to increase the billing rates to cover the costs of service that CMS doesn‚Äôt cover. These increased billings to private insurers is passed along to the patient in the firm of increased premiums. So, the cost isn‚Äôt cheaper, people on private insurance are subsidizing already subsidized coverage. A double dip I suppose.

I am concerned with better outcomes for citizens, and believe that the doctor patient relationship is best kept between those two parties. No need to get the feds involved.

It also only goes to repairing school infrastructure, which yes, is important, but if you can't get teachers into these buildings because their pay is so abysmal, what does it matter? If your books are 4 decades old, doesn't do much good, either. Plus, the amount they'll grant to any one particular school for major infrastructural repairs is just a drop in the bucket.

Nursing is in demand everywhere. If she can stomach it, the prisons are always looking for nurses and they pay well. 

Most of the people bitching about wages moved here from states like California and expected to still make that kind of money with a cost of living that was much lower. Housing cost, especially rent, is a problem because of the California transplants moving in and buying up houses and apartment buildings with cash and turning them into rentals.

Not too long ago, I sat in a nail salon listening to another customer bitch about how she couldn't find a job here because no one paid what she was worth. She was expecting California wages in a state where $1m gets you much better than a shack and couldn't figure out why she was being offered less. 

She (a white woman) bitched (to a Vietnamese nail tech) that the state is too white. It doesn't take much research to find out Idaho is over 90% white. If that's something that meant so much to her, maaaybe she should have looked into it before moving here. 

Her sons are adopted and black, so I almost understood where she was coming from (she did say she wanted them to have friends that look like them) but then she followed it up with ""I want them to have a diverse group of friends."" Her comments after that made it clear she meant not white, and that Hispanic wasn't diverse enough. 

Unfortunately those kinds of rants are far too common from the Californians moving here. Especially the left leaning ones.

You might check Donors Choose for the areas you're considering to learn what needs teachers are looking to fill and what they have to say about that their student population.  I only have one friend who still teaches at the secondary level as my other friends had to leave for jobs with larger incomes.

That is the problem with affirmative action, you are punishing the grandchild with punishment for the grand father. I personally have never done anything close to being criminal to other races or sexes but you are saying that I should be punished because someone else was criminal and cruel. That is unacceptable. And a step further, my forefathers on my dad side were abolitionists that fought against those that oppressed. So should I be rewarded because they fought the good fight against oppression? On my mom side they were still in Europe at the time.

Again, people are responsible for their own actions. Affirmative action directly violates this principle. I believe that we should have programs to support disadvantaged people, which are abundant if you look at places like the University of Utah (which is my alma mater). If you are a disadvantaged minority there it is relatively easy to get a full ride scholarship (I know because I researched it). As opposed to the white male demographic where you essentially have to be a 3.95 to 4.00 GPA to get one. 

I think programs like that are great and go a long way to lowering barriers for those that have less means.

I don't live there right now, so I only get the news of subtle cultural changes from my parents. You may get the occasional aggressive, ""go back to California. You're the reason our expenses are increasing"" type. But... Those are few (in my experience). You'll see that rhetoric from more people through social media because it's easier to hide behind home doors and a screen to say things like that.

Idaho is the perfect place for outdoorsy things. The mountains and Snake River plains are incredible. Camping is everywhere. You might want to look into online community boards in Meridian and the surrounding area. They'll be able to help get you some good ideas closer than what I'd recommend. Also, I included a link to a specific state campsite, but it can take you to outdoor recreation resources in general. I do have to say, though... One of my favorite camping sites growing up was Birch Creek. Awesome fishing, trails, and camp spots. The state fairs in Idaho are among the best in the country (IMO)! I live in Florida, and these fairs in FL, GA, and AL are miniscule and boring compared to what I grew up with (but...

Correlation does not equal causation. This type of relationship, while important scientifically, does not mean what the average lay-person thinks and can easily be misleading. The only proposed mechanism for a causal relationship is not from any of the included studies, and is based on early research that has not established a link. This article discusses changes in trends between 2000 and 3000 feet, while the primary focus of research on hypoxia in humans is focused on [altitudes above 3000 meters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405810/). This doesn't disprove anything, it just means the hypothesized mechanism needs more research before it can be positively associated with any observed correlation.

If they aren‚Äôt debating &amp; passing legislation to ‚Äúsuit the needs‚Äù of their constituents, they aren‚Äôt doing their jobs. 

There are currently at least SEVEN bills in the ID house dealing w/issues like rent protection, property taxes, utility costs for veterans &amp; the elderly, and ongoing discussions about letting cities raise funds in different ways for housing &amp; infrastructure. These issues aren‚Äôt being addressed. 

‚ÄúThe few complaining‚Äù about housing???
Affordable housing has been among the top concerns of voters in the state for the last few years. Literally 10,000s of Idaho residents can‚Äôt find or afford housing anymore - and not just near Boise - CdA, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls - all are growing. 

Last year the Boise Area alone needed to add something like ~20K new residences just to keep up. Rents have gone up by 20% or more. Home prices have quadrupled in the last decade while wages remained flat, and elderly people w/paid-off mortgages are faced with selling their homes due to stupid state laws about property taxes. 

You think *this* is ‚Äúmore important‚Äù? 
Based on what? Why? 

For comparison: 
A recent estimate is that on average transgender people make up about 0.6% of the population in the US.

There are 332 high schools in Idaho, the largest of which have about 2000 students. 0.6% transgender means 1.2 students at the *largest* high schools in the state. Let‚Äôs be realistic/generous and triple that, because not all are free to be ‚Äúout‚Äù, especially in conservative religious areas w/people like the genius who introduced this legislation. In that case there could even be a whopping 3-4 per school. 

That‚Äôs &lt; 1500 transgender students statewide. This legislation only bans trans male-to-female women from competing on women‚Äôs teams, so that‚Äôs roughly 750 students. Of those only some fraction are hypothetically affected by this legislation IF they wanted to be athletes on the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù team, and now can‚Äôt. 

So instead of doing anything useful, 1 state legislator got it into her head that it was a more important use of her time to keep maybe 300 trans kids from enjoying sports than it is to keep a roof over 1000s of her constituents‚Äô heads. 

That‚Äôs just fucking stupid.

Federal criteria for wolf recovery require only 150 wolves in the state.   
&gt;  
&gt;During the 14-day public comment period on the proposals, Fish and Game received more than 27,000 responses, the overwhelming majority of which were negative. (For context, agency spokesman Brian Pearson said most proposals receive between 200 and 2,000 comments during the same time period.)  
&gt;  
&gt;However, officials noted that more than 80% of the responses came from outside of Idaho; in many cases, they were from outside of the United States.

No indication she ever came back from the trip. 

My first thought on reading that: [this poor dude](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/yellowstone-hot-springs-death-hot-pot_n_582cf703e4b058ce7aa9258f?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvc2lhLm9yZy8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEQph8qnKANudWqvNcx_lb8YnlCutiUQSggT0Hc9QTnu6nG51uB_pz_GYrfjJHYsueuvRMrbalG5BtASNvgYTXV7zVN-DRbYCo0w16JAiKDclO6zCTu0F7nXUxRTtpv5k2c62sqUOkqT09qBoq9y_JuePhRuIOIsKVrxouMnSkpj) who fell into a Yellowstone hot spring last summer &amp; was ""turned into soup"" and completely vanished within a day. No way anyone ever finds this girl. Can only hope they knocked her out first.

Weird new twist to this already messed-up story though ... Where did the niece Melanie come from &amp; what's her deal?? Lori, her brother Alex, and her niece Melanie (Alex's daughter?) all apparently had condos in the same Rexburg complex where the kids were last seen. 

To Recap the timeline &amp; court docs:

* Lori's brother Alex Cox shot Lori's ex-husband in ""self defense"" in AZ in July.
* A month or so later, Lori moves the kids to the same Rexburg condo complex where her brother &amp; niece live. She lied to JJs school &amp; said they were moving to CA.
* A few weeks later, Alex goes on the trip to Yellowstone where Tylee was last seen. 
* \~2 weeks later JJ is pulled out of ID school, mom lies repeatedly, &amp; he is never seen again. 
* A week later Lori rents a storage unit &amp; puts most of the kids' stuff in it.
* That same week, Alex Cox drove back to AZ, in Tylee's dead dad's Jeep that Tylee often drove, weeks *after* she'd disappeared
* Alex attempted &amp; failed to shoot Melanie's ex-husband, who identifies him and the Jeep, and then apparently drives it back to Rexburg.
* \~2 weeks after that, Tami Daybell - Chad's wife - dies at home of ""natural causes"".
* \~2 weeks later, Chad &amp; Lori get married in Hawaii, because that's totally not suspicious.
* \~2 weeks later, Rexburg police ask about the missing kids &amp; Alex and Chad lie to them. 
* Chad, the dumbass, told police he didn't know Lori or her phone #, despite having just married her. Why wasn't he arrested too??
* Chad &amp; Lori disappear that night and fly to Kauai. Alex &amp; Melanie's homes are searched the next day and no kids are found.
* Chad &amp; Lori ask an AZ friend (a different 'Melanie') to lie about having JJ, presumably because they think it makes sense that JJ might've been seen in AZ for some reason?? 
* \~2 weeks later, Tami Daybell gets exhumed to perform another autopsy. The next day, Alex Cox collapses and dies in his bathroom in AZ, but police haven't said how. 
* TWO MONTHS PASS while these psychos hang out on the beach in Kauai doing yoga without being arrested. They have both kids' birth certificates, but no kids, Tylee's debit card &amp; a cell phone, and JJs iPad. Another story mentioned Tylee's friends receiving texts from her phone that ""didn't sound like her."" 

So, Alex killed Lori's ex. He probably killed Tylee at Yellowstone &amp; then took her car. He might've killed (or helped dispose of JJ) on the same trip back to AZ where he also tried/failed to kill Melanie's (his daughter's?) ex husband, which is a part of this story that hasn't gotten much attention.

Alex also might've killed or been aware of how Tami Daybell died, because he &amp; Chad clearly knew each other, and both obviously lied to police. Then Alex died under similar circumstances &lt; 24hrs after they dug her up. Alex probably killed himself using whatever substance killed Tami Daybell - Aconite or similar shit they got from watching too much TV. 

I'm wondering what niece Melanie knows and if she's as bat-shit insane as the rest of them ... 

Also wondering WHY Alex would do any of this ... WTF?

I wonder why...   State taxes are skyrocketing, housing prices are now out of reach for the income levels of idahoans.  The average income for a family of two in Boise is $55,000 a year and with the influx of out of staters they simply can't compete.  Property tax increases alone are beyond what many idahoans can simply afford.  They are being forced to leave the state that they grew up in to simply afford to live.  Traffic is getting out of hand, crime is rising, natural resources and cool areas like hot springs in Idaho are being shut down due to the influx of new people trashing them.  Camping reservations are slammed for years in advance.  Locals are literally being ran out of their own state that they made great and you call it a ""weird rivalry""....

As for fourth option, wireless, there is nothing that competes well on price and speed with the wired options. (The price difference is in hardware rental.)

Also a museum about the Teton Flood in Rexburg, which is nearby. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g35583-d6997782-Reviews-Museum_of_Rexburg_Home_of_the_Teton_Flood_Exhibit-Rexburg_Idaho.html

4316,Peliquin,"If you live in Silver Valley and commute over the pass it could work, but  I'd say that's pretty low income for a family of four (dog included) even if you are renting a home in Kellogg or Pinehurst. They are getting more expensive. You could do it if you owned the house outright and played roulette with flood insurance. In fact, I just calculated that if you own a home and a car outright, then you have 500 dollars a month for each member of your family after paying taxes, utilities, and basic insurance. 

In my opinion, that is not a lot of money up here, as food is very expensive compared to southern California. The quality and selection is also lower. Because many homes are not insulated well, power costs can go through the roof in the winter. Before I insulated my home, it was possible to get up to 300 dollars a month in heating bills. If you buy a very good home, though, you'd have a lot more breathing room.

I've personally scraped by on less than 30k, and spent a year hovering around 40k, but it was, to be totally honest, a real drag. It's tough to live up here and not be able to partake in what it has to offer because you simply can't afford to to be anywhere but home. I didn't eat out, go to the movies, or buy anything not absolutely critical for a year. I didn't even spend the gas to go to the woods. I walked my local trails until I could do them in my sleep. I ate the most basic things I could buy and I have a real fear of having to live like that again. Poverty in North Idaho is almost epidemic in some parts, and once you get into it, getting out is very difficult because of the lack of economic engines up here. To put it bluntly, our economic engine is tourism, and that's a terrible job sector for security.

A possibly better option is to live in Washington and commute into CDA -- Washington will have programs for the baby and a nursing mother, as well as affordable healthcare. If you don't want to be on the dole, however, I think you need to be making closer to 50,000 a year.

4328,ElBanditoBlanco,"Hijacking your comment to point out something unrelated (sorry!) - 

**TLDR:** We need better journalism in this country. Regardless of this article's merit, it is a good example of opinion based reporting being presented as fact. It is also a good example of only providing information that reinforces the authors opinions. CNN, Fox, MSNBC, ABC, etc all do this and it is counter-productive to an informed society. 

Okay. So...

Regardless of how you feel about this issue(or others for that matter) this is a great article to demonstrate how opinion based reporting is being presented as fact all across the nation.

Now, I agree that prop-47 may have led to an increase in petty crime. It also may have eased over prosecution of petty theft in our broken justice system. Or perhaps it has little affect on criminals because they are criminals regardless of the repercussions. I don't know and I am in no better place to make that determination after reading the article. I'm not trying to make an argument one way or the other about prop-47. I just wanted to point out that there is almost no actual data to support their claims in the article. They do bring up the cost of stolen goods in SF, but they don't compare it to previous years, state that it was an increase/decrease, or tell you anything of actual meaning about that cost.

I'm not saying their claims are or are not accurate. Just pointing out that all of their supporting data are opinions of a couple of store owners and not hard data. It also happens to be only the opinions of store owners who help to validate the authors claim. Giving the appearance that all store owners agree with the author. There are no dissenting opinions to compare to. I'm certain there are store owners who advocate for prop-47. Why would they? I don't know for sure. Mostly because their opinions aren't being represented here. After all, there are two sides to every coin and only one side is on display here. Plus, prop-47 was approved by voters. So there are people who support it out there. Their opinions just aren't here for you to read in this article. Heck if you only get your news from Fox(in this example), you may never even hear what is on the other side of that coin. 

Fox is purposefully giving you half of the information in order to persuade you to agree with this author's opinion. Proper journalism should not do this. Fucking CNN, MSNBC, ABC, Fox, etc; they *all* do this. **This is not journalism.** Its opinions that are reinforced by other opinions and presented as facts with no dissent.

Imagine if we lived in a world where articles like this had headlines that read: ""Here is the data on prop-47, read it and decide what it means to you."" Or at the very least a world where articles must provide the data used by the author to make their assertions. That way you would at least have the option to review the *same data* as the author to form your own opinions and make empirically based decisions. Instead we are constantly surrounded by fear mongering on all platforms, across the political spectrum.

4369,Zirk208,"There are two parts to a shoplifting incident:

I- Entering the store with the intent to commit a theft.  This falls under burglary, IC 18-1401, and is a felony

II- Taking property belonging to another.  This is the theft.  IC 18-2403/2407.  Under $1,000 is a misdemeanor.  $1,000.01 and up is a felony. 

They are using the extreme example of stealing candy to create more reactions, since one could enter a grocery store with the sole intent of committing a theft, steal the $1.09 candy bar, get caught, and be charged with Burglary (felony) and Petit Theft (misdemeanor theft under $1,000).

What really happens is, Johnny Tweaker goes into walmart, loads a cart full of merchandise, far in excess of the value of  candy bar, and does a cart push out the front door to his waiting friend parked in the fire lane.  This more closely falls inline with the definition of burglary.  Johnny Tweaker entered the store, with zero money of his own, zero intention of paying for goods/services, with every intention of committing a theft, he loads the cart and he's out in a matter of minutes.  It's a planned, premeditated action.

In reality, most prosecutors dump the burglary charge as soon s it comes across their desk, and plead out the misdemeanor petit theft to a fine and unsupervised probation.  Is Idaho making felons out of candy thieves?   I would venture to say no, but there's probably some example in the history of the state where someone got convicted of it.

I googled and found a quick article stating:
A report from Chicago authorities¬†found that nearly 60% of illegal guns recovered in the city¬†from 2009 to 2013 were first sold in states with more lax gun laws. The largest portion came from Indiana, which accounted for 19% of the¬†illegal guns in Chicago.
It's not like people in Chicago don't have cars. As a youth, we would go to Indiana to get the good fireworks. Looks like the bangers are doing the same thing with real weapons.
Now that said, what we know is the real problem in Chicago isn't the gun laws or lack thereof. It is the fact that you have 9.5 million people in the metro area. Too many people gets folks wound up. Also there is a huge gang problem.  
The population in Idaho is less than 2 million. I'm willing to bet that if you had 9.5 million people in the treasure valley, there would be more gun violence.

4631,SpongeBobSquareChin,"Let me explain myself a little more clearly so as not to be misinterpreted. My main grips are: Forgetfulness. I get in and out of cars all day, every single day for work. I work on private property so I don‚Äôt have to take my gun off while getting in and out and driving around the property. I also happen to get in and out of my personal vehicle a lot when not at work. A big part of Little‚Äôs reason to pass the permit less carry in city limits was because he didn‚Äôt want 18-20 year olds forgetting to take their guns out when crossing city lines and becoming criminals. That‚Äôs my line of thinking when it comes to concealed inside a vehicle. Gripe two. Contact with a loaded firearm. The way it is now forces me to handle my firearm way more than needed while around other people. Not only do I not like taking my gun out of its holster simply to transfer it to another less secure location, but I don‚Äôt like to make people that I‚Äôm traveling with uncomfortable with me pulling a gun out and putting it in my Micro Roni to transport. Gripe three. Crashes. In a crash, I‚Äôd like to know where the loaded gun is flying around my cab while my car rolls. A level three(?) holster that‚Äôs permanently mounted to the vehicle could help this, but that would require modifications to the vehicle and it would not do any good when traveling in a vehicle that is not yours. Which is another gripe (number four.) Traveling in a foreign vehicle. If you wish to travel with somebody else, you must remove your entire holster or remove the gun and have it sit somewhere in their vehicle unsecured because it has to be in the open (crash comes in mind again.) This also opens you to disclosing you are carrying to everybody in the vehicle, like it or not. I have done work with special needs groups several times and because I do not like the possibilities that could come of leaving a loaded firearm within arms reach of some of those people who do not know the dangers of a firearm, I often travel in my own vehicle when I could have car pooled instead. Gripe five. Constitutional carry. If 18 year olds can walk down Main Street past hundreds of people and even cops with a Glock 19 concealed, why is it such a big deal when it comes to concealed inside a vehicle? For police safety? It‚Äôs already illegal to not notify police that there is a gun in the car. Why does it matter if the cops sees it vs not seeing it? A criminal that doesn‚Äôt want the cop to see it is gonna hide it and not tell the cop he has it anyways. So why do you think law abiding citizens shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to carry concealed inside a vehicle without a permit? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm arguing here. I think it‚Äôs dumb that we can‚Äôt.",1582946109,fj2km19
4632,SpongeBobSquareChin,"Again, you have added little to nothing to the actual conversation. There‚Äôs a million and one ways to skin the cat that is unholstering and placing a firearm into a vehicle. That‚Äôs not what the conversation was about. The conversation was about why the law is obsolete now that permit less carry is legal. You‚Äôre explaining something that nobody asked about. Maybe if you slowed down and tried to approach my replies with more on topic replies you wouldn‚Äôt think that I was being a bit short for no good reason. Now if you‚Äôd like to talk to me about why you are not allowed to, but should be allowed to,  conceal carry in a vehicle without a permit, I‚Äôd be glad to keep talking about my original gripe.",1582946666,fj2lciw

And it kept dropping. Each year murders when down. For 3 straight years murders fell after Chicago gained more and more concealed carriers. We‚Äôre currently in the fourth year, 2020.

The city claims the drop in shootings is because they hired 1200 more police which I am sure plays a big part, but it's never just one thing I'm sure.

Idaho corrections is such a racket for rich people. Once you‚Äôre in (it could be something small, like this article, or possession of weed, or a DUI), they will make sure you‚Äôre in and out for at least a decade. You might get a 2-3 year sentence, but it will be drawn out for 10 years in and out because the make the terms of probation/parole nearly impossible. 

The reason for this is some rich fat white men are getting even richer off the telco, concessions, and fees.Like $10 phone calls, $4 bags of chips, $10 bars of soap, etc. Everything is marked up ridiculously, and the food served in the cafeteria is watered down cardboard that has been marked up 200% so some guy with a yacht can get rich.

Judges, law enforcement, and politicians are all pushing for corrections to stay privatized because it equals more money for them. The employees in the system (cops/parole officers/guards/judges) will have good job security either way, but the folks in charge don‚Äôt get their kickbacks unless it‚Äôs privatized. 

As soon as prisons are no longer ran for profit, you‚Äôll see our legal system putting REAL criminals in jail, not average Joe who did a victimless crime.

&gt;  
&gt;‚Äî Baron de Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws  
&gt;  
&gt;In most states throughout the nation, legislative corruption is taken seriously.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúA member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill proposed or pending before the General Assembly, shall disclose the fact to the House of which he is a member, and shall not vote thereon upon pain of expulsion,‚Äù reads the Kentucky Constitution.

&gt;‚ÄúA Legislator engages in a violation of legislative ethics if that Legislator votes on a question in connection with a conflict of interest in committee or in either body of the Legislature or attempts to influence the outcome of that question...‚Äù the laws of Maine state.  
&gt;  
&gt;But in Idaho, corruption is openly permitted. Idaho allows representatives and senators to vote on matters in which they have a business interest as long as they declare that a conflict of interest exists. All a lawmaker must do, in essence, is declare: ‚ÄúI intend to behave corruptly.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;That permissiveness to corruption was on particularly graphic display Monday during the debate over the Idaho Patient Act, a bill put forward by Melaleuca CEO Frank VanderSloot as the capstone of his crusade against abusive practices in the medical debt collection industry. The bill comes particularly in response to the collection practices of Medical Recovery Services, whose cases are mostly litigated by Rep. Bryan Zollinger, R-Idaho Falls.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI have a conflict, as this bill is directly intended and is a direct result of my practice ‚Äî business doing medical debt collections as an attorney,‚Äù Zollinger said on the House floor Monday. ‚ÄúI will, however, exercise my right to vote.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Zollinger went on to debate for an unheard-of 40 minutes against the bill and then to vote against it. All Idahoans should feel humiliated and enraged that this was allowed to happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Maine, Zollinger would have been guilty of an ethics violation for this act. In Kentucky, Zollinger would be subject to expulsion from the House. In at least 30 states, a vote would be constitutionally forbidden, illegal or against legislative rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zollinger‚Äôs justification for his act was paltry.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIf it was just affecting me, I would absolutely not vote, but this affects every Idahoan,‚Äù he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;This excuse is convenient in that it applies to every piece of legislation that exists or could be conceived. No bill can apply to a single individual or company without violating both the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions, which prohibit bills of attainder. What distinguishes a bill where a lawmaker has a conflict of interest is that it affects their pocketbook to a greater degree than everyone else‚Äôs. Few clearer examples exist than the Idaho Patient Act for Zollinger, as he himself conceded.  
&gt;  
&gt;Monday‚Äôs shocking exercise of legal corruption demands a swift and firm response. If they have integrity, both the House and Senate will alter their rules to forbid voting when a lawmaker has a conflict of interest. Better ethics rules would ban not only voting but follow Maine laws in forbidding any attempt to change the outcome of a vote by debating or engaging in advocacy relating to bills where a conflict of interest exists.  
&gt;  
&gt;Consider another recent example involving Zollinger and medical debt collection. During the brief tenure of Sen. Tony Potts, R-Idaho Falls, he brought forward a bill that would have effectively reversed an Idaho Supreme Court case that Zollinger lost on behalf of Medical Recovery Services. Potts was in personal bankruptcy, and he had accepted pre-session campaign contributions from Bryan Smith, Zollinger‚Äôs boss. Potts used a large portion of these funds to pay his rent during the legislative session ‚Äî rent he paid to Zollinger, his roommate. When asked in committee who had brought him the legislation, Potts said it was Zollinger.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the problem here is not primarily Zollinger, who is simply one representative who will serve for a time in office then move on to other pursuits. The problem is that the Legislature permits this to take place in the people‚Äôs Capitol. As long as this conduct is permitted, it will continue to happen ‚Äî and likely get worse. Legislative leadership should lead the charge to end it.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit,‚Äù reads the Idaho Constitution.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is to say, not for the financial benefit of members of the Legislature, or of their bosses, or of the people who pay their rent.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the House and Senate will not reform themselves, the people should use the right of the ballot initiative to sweep corruption from their house.",1583175876,fjalku2

Legalize marijuana and tax it heavily. I‚Äôm talking like 25-50%


Raise taxes on tobacco and alcohol. They cause more hospital trips than almost anything else, so they should start covering it more. Small tax on these though. 




Other means:


Start treating the healthcare industry like a utility. You know how power companies are set to a standard price because they can‚Äôt have any competition? Like they‚Äôre still allowed to profit but those profits are regulated. 

I‚Äôd do the same with things like insulin. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for it to be hiked 500%. So that would lower overall costs.



Additionally there‚Äôs a few regulations hospitals have to follow that just waste supplies and money. For instance, a buddy is an EMT and they have these kits that cost abound a grand each total. If they open it for whatever reason, they have to replace the kit entirely... regardless if they only used one part of it (like a bandaid or some shit).

So stop shit like that. Have the nurses/doctors/EMT‚Äôs get a say in what they need to purchase and use. The price gauging for profits is disgusting and one reason I believe healthcare is so high.

Should be illegal for companies like amazon to make people full time employees part time to avoid healthcare costs. That‚Äôs unethical in my view

My guess, and I could be wrong, so let me know, is that you bought likely sometime between 2010-2013, if you were buying a house in California for that ""cheap.""  Either that, or it would have been prior to 2003.  

As for the math, let's figure this.  Assuming they are putting 20% down on $300k, that's $60k.   That's a heck of a down payment to have saved; most people would be rolling that from the sale of a previous home.  But let's just say a person has this.  Financing $240k at 4% for 30 years is about a $1,500 per month monthly payment, all in.  

$60k (gross) is $5k per month (gross), and likely around $4k, give or take (probably a bit less, actually).  That puts the monthly payment at 30% of gross salary, and 37.5% of net wages, which is right at the upper threshold of what is recommended (28% gross, 36% gross).  

That's for a $300k home with 20% down.  Obviously if the house price goes up, and/or the down payment goes down, you're well beyond what the threshold of affordability is.

Here's the thing - we can't all make in excess of $60k per year, and people have to be able to affordably live somewhere.  And even if we spiked wages so people are making more than $60k per year, house prices will increase just that much more anyway. 

You and I both know this is a larger systemic problem.  Right now home ownership is increasingly becoming the province of the rich and privileged; we are seeing an increasing gap between the wealth and the middle and working class (indeed, the middle class continues to shrink), and part of that wealth gap is ownership of one's home (or real estate generally). 

I fully understand the problem is worse in California and Seattle, et al.  I also fully understand why middle and working class people try to leverage whatever wealth they have accumulated in ""cheaper"" markets like Boise, but that then also creates a cascading effect whereby Boise residents, making Boise wages, are finding themselves in a situation of housing instability (forget even buying a house, paying the rent is a problem). 

This is both a housing supply and a wage/salary issue, neither of which are fixed overnight, or even in a few years.  

And while California ""helps"" its citizens in some ways, I don't see how it pertains to this particular topic, given the housing crisis is far worse there than it is here.

Elon Musk's said Starlink is intended for rural, semi-rural (the implication being places where fixed lines and cell don't reach today.)

Back of the napkin math here, Starlink has approval for 42,000 satellites. Let's say they get to 42,000 in a couple years (they have 240 up now.) MIT's estimate of capacity per satellite is 20Gbps. The satellites will be evenly spaced across the globe, they orbit in a grid, but let's say somehow they only cover land... this puts about 6.6% of them over US (3.8M sq miles / 57.5M sq miles), so max 55440Gpbs (EDIT: removed errant 0) to the US. A Netflix HD stream needs 5Mbps or so (let's say everyone forgot about 4K, multiple devices, things other than Netflix), and so Starlink could sustain about 11 million US customers watching Netflix on 1 TV on any given evening, 5Mbps.

The number of US households is 126 million. About half are Netflix subscribers, 60 million. FCC says about 90% already have 25Mbps connection or better.

&gt; **Big Idaho businesses come out against transgender athlete, birth certificate bills**
&gt; *By NATHAN BROWN* 
&gt;
&gt; BOISE ‚Äî Four of Idaho's major employers have come out against bills that would block transgender people from changing their birth certificates and ban transgender girls and women from playing on female high school and college sports teams.
&gt; 
&gt; In a letter sent March 2 to Senate State Affairs Committee Chairwoman Patti Anne Lodge, R-Huston, and Vice Chairman Mark Harris, R-Soda Springs, Chobani, Clif Bar, HP and Micron expressed concern these bills could hurt their ability to recruit employees.
&gt; 
&gt; Chobani and Clif Bar have major factories in Twin Falls. HP and Micron are technology companies and big employers in the Boise area. Idaho National Laboratory Director Mark Peters sent a letter to House and Senate leadership Tuesday expressing similar concerns about some of the Legislature's discussions this year, although he didn't call out the two bills explicitly as they did.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Both bills have already passed the House but haven't gotten a hearing yet in the Senate.
&gt; 
&gt; The full letter is below:
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Senators Lodge and Harris:
&gt; 
&gt; We write to share our concerns regarding legislation that recently passed the House of Representatives and is now pending in the Senate. Specifically, this includes House Bills 500 and 509.
&gt; 
&gt; As businesses, we‚Äôre committed to the principles of diversity and inclusion, and we are very proud to call Idaho home. It‚Äôs a privilege and honor to be ambassadors for the state in our daily interactions with customers, communities, and companies across the nation and around the world. We proudly talk about its strong and growing economy, and how it‚Äôs one of the best places in the nation to do business and live. Most important, we talk about the welcoming, big-hearted spirit of its people, and why our employees are so grateful to live and raise their families here.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a well-earned reputation and these bills targeting transgender Idahoans puts that reputation at risk and goes against creating a workforce that welcomes all. Passage of these bills could hurt our ability to attract and retain top talent to Idaho, and it could damage Idaho‚Äôs ability to attract new businesses and create new jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; With respect, we ask you to support all of Idaho‚Äôs diverse communities and reject these measures.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt; Chobani

Idaho is too great for hate.  Companies have embraced inclusivity and diversity of races, religions, sexes, and gender identity.  They can't attract or hold talent they need without that ability.  This laws makes it very difficult to maintain top talent in tech.   Diversity and inclusivity knows no bounds - if I have to accept your Christianity then you have to accept their gender identity.

Transgender history, in the broadest sense, includes examples of gender variance and gender nonconformity in cultures worldwide since ancient times. As this history is prior to the coining of the modern term ""transgender"", opinions of how to categorize these people and identities can vary.

Sumerian and Akkadian texts from 4500 years ago document transgender or transvestite priests known as gala and by other names. In the Americas prior to European colonization, as well as in some contemporary cultures, some North American Indigenous cultures traditionally recognize third gender or multi-gender roles, such as the Navajo n√°dleehi gender spectrum or the Zuni lhamana.

Racism has been around even longer and only started being considered problematic pretty recently.  You're still arguing basically ""this is OK because it was OK in the past"" and that's still a really bad argument.

&gt;Secondly, no one is born racist - it's a learned behavior. No one is taught to be transgender.

While I agree with you no one is born racist, we don't conclusively know what causes gender dysphoria - or even sexual orientation.  You're [again] confusing theories you agree with for fact.

5081,JesusCumelette,"&gt;Legislation significantly increasing what it will cost nonresidents to hunt deer and elk in Idaho has been signed into law by Gov. Brad Little.

&gt;The Republican governor signed the measure Tuesday that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game says resident hunters asked for so there will be less overcrowding in the field.¬†Fish and Game is capping how many nonresidents can hunt deer and elk.

&gt;But that will result in reducing Fish and Game revenue with fewer nonresident hunters.

&gt;To make up for that, Fish and Game is increasing hunting and fishing costs for non-residents.

&gt;Notably, an elk tag for a nonresident hunter will cost $650.


Overheard two gentlemen talking about how there were 'no elk in the surrounding area and have been coming to Idaho to hunt the past couple of years' while filling up with gas in Yreka over the summer. Quick Google said the current price is ~$420 in Idaho and Oregon is ~$590 for out-of-state license.

The latter sums up the former rather nicely. Yes, a significant population in Idaho (statewide) are racists and bigots. Most are not outwardly so. The people I see screaming about how untrue this is are delusional because on the most part, it's not the KKK/Swastika/Aryan Nation type of racism that people oversimplify with, it's the subtle version that has shaped their world views, and tend to generalize based on skin color/religion/culture.

5122,idahoVoiceOfReason,"First of all you rebutted your point with the last sentence. Testing is prevention of a spread. Just because we don‚Äôt have it... you get it. 

Someone just posted the site on this subreddit for my source, but there have been something like 35 individuals that were suspected to have it but didn‚Äôt (somehow I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not more given the hysteria.) 

I think one of the points of asking this question could be to probe how much having people without health insurance around could hurt all of us. If a Hispanic temporary worker or even non-Hispanic American citizen doesn‚Äôt have health insurance but might work in the health industry as a CNA or something they could potentially not get tested due to the cost of healthcare. If you read about the way this virus spreads it only takes one person walking around in a busy place to potentially affect hundreds. 

Having people in our society who cannot afford and do not have access to healthcare is a public health concern for all of us. This virus is one of the many situations that shows it. 

And if the solution is to kick them all out and ‚Äúbuild a wall‚Äù then:
A) humans have been doing that for quite a long time. It never really works and is usually just a political ploy to rally the base against ‚Äúthe others‚Äù. The others people usually people more similar to us than our leaders but different enough looking so that people who fall for the divide and conquer ploy fall for it. 

B) maybe we should test their DNA against the Native Americans who were here in Idaho 16,000 years before white people and see who was here first.",1583540560,fjp2yga
5123,idahoVoiceOfReason,"There really are very few black people in Idaho. There are quite a few Hispanics but I‚Äôd say since living here I have seen very little integration of white and Hispanic communities compared to the east coast. The Hispanics look and seem marginalized and since they are marginalized they do occupy a lower general socio-economic status.  The most likely people to look down on them though? The white people who occupy the exact same SES and therefor are the most threatened for jobs, courtship of potential mates, etc.  

I‚Äôve found Idaho isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwoke‚Äù at all and that the east coast is so ‚Äúwoke‚Äù that they‚Äôd rather die than work with a person who isn‚Äôt woke even if the results of compromising would result in cancer being cured.  Not sure which is worse.

What I will say is that I still haven‚Äôt changed my license plate since coming here and you can just tell people judging me in disproval. They don‚Äôt like outsiders in general and I mostly think it‚Äôs about hoarding the great amount of public space here and keeping things affordable and cheap.

This was in broad daylight. Couple miles from the capital. 

There is something distinctly different about happens when you trap a bunch of poor ignorant people into a few inner city blocks vs if they live with plenty of space between them. I feel like it just breeds less anger and frustration. 

As far as Idaho I‚Äôm thinking the times I thought I would have been treated differently when I was black 1) when the police pull you over for not signaling 2)if you are on a rural road pulled over and stop here people almost always stop to ask you how you are doing and to make sure you are okay. 

I feel like in both of these situations a black person with the wrong attitude and clothing could probably end up with more  scrutiny for the same reason I did... it‚Äôd just be like... why are you here?  

Now plenty of people come through Idaho for the national parks or for jobs all the time. 

That black or Hispanic guy with Cali, SW border state or Illinois plates, tinted windows playing his music loud and dressed in the latest threadz popularized by musicians that glamorize drug dealing while driving into a trailer park that had 20 overdoses in the last year... well that dude is probably going to get pulled over and harassed... and that‚Äôs completely legal in most states in the United States.

Hillary Clinton was said to be electable because she appealed to the moderate Republican. I think what we learned in 2016 is that the so-called moderate Republican decided to vote for Trump anyway or simply sat out the election rather than vote for Hillary. Trump currently has an 89% percent approval rating from Republicans. That is an awfully small black of voters to try and appeal to. Furthermore, the Trump Campaign is going to try their best to make Joe into as much of a villain as possible in the run-up to the general. It happened before in 2016 with Hillary's email scandal; it is happening now with the Biden Ukraine scandal. It doesn't matter how fake these scandals are.

Regardless of if Sanders is a communist or not, he will be painted as such which will drive republican voter turn out.

Another system that is broken is student loans. They allow kids to go $100s of thousands into debt on a degree with no promise of work that can pay it off. What other institution would give that much credit without collateral? None. They should say no to students seeking loans of that size.

As for other countries being appalled, that is mostly due to how things are being portrayed to them and their opinion isn't important to me.

5240,ShenmeNamaeSollich,"&gt;Trump has turned out to be not as bad as I thought

What fucking rock have you been living under? 

""Religious Conservative?"" Trump's admin has literally stolen kids from their parents and imprisoned babies in camps w/zero plans to reunite them. They refused to provide them with toothpaste and soap and bedding. His admin deliberately failed/refused to distribute aid to U.S. citizens following hurricane &amp; earthquake damage in Puerto Rico. He has parroted Nazi propaganda on immigration, and openly promoted racism, sexism, and religious discrimination (while pretending to be a fake Christian, which any idiot who's ever looked at a Bible ought to be able to see). Don't care? Ok ... 

""Fiscal conservative""? He has misappropriated millions in taxpayer dollars for himself &amp; his family, taken illegal bribes from foreign govt's that pay his businesses for favors, spent $400 million golfing at his own resorts (more than the entire Obama family spent on all personal travel in 8 years) to the point that it bankrupted the Secret Service's budget. He started a pointless trade war w/China, which the U.S. has badly lost, resulting in needing to pay billions in unfunded bailouts to U.S. farmers (the same folks who'll vote against ""socialism"" that just saved their asses). He pushed through a tax cut that ONLY benefits the top 1% of all tax payers (himself), got rid of basic exemptions that middle-class &amp; low-income people relied on, and which conservative groups have admitted didn't work (again, because trickle-down never fucking does). 

""Drain the Swamp!""?:  He has given his own kids high-paying do-nothing jobs with security clearances they should never have received due to conflicts of interest, and they've gotten favors from foreign govt's that they shouldn't have received. Taxpayers pay for his \*grown adult kids &amp; their families\* to travel for Trump family business &amp; vacations.

He has lied to the public nearly 20,000 times - mostly in easily debunked &amp; profoundly stupid ways. He put utterly unqualified yes-men/women into every agency in govt (several of whom have had to resign or face jail time for corruption &amp; abuse of power in office). He has unilaterally broken treaties &amp; trade agreements, destroying the ability of anyone worldwide to ever believe the word of a US president ever again. He has actively tried to undermine the DOJ, FBI, CIA, DOD, State Dept, and anyone else who disagrees with him purely to serve his own selfish interests. 

The idiot Republicans in Congress actually now support the idea that ANY President can legally do whatever the fuck he wants while in office. How the hell did the GOP sink to that? How is that ""Conservative""?? They claim to ""love America""? Bull-fucking shit. 

""Oh but he doesn't take a salary!""? He has ""donated"" a fraction and spent $100s of millions more golfing and charging the Secret Service, and then lying about it. Notice that the most recent ""donation"" check was ""c/o the Mar a Lago Club,"" meaning it's a tax-deductible business expense. He's still conning people and profiting personally. Can we see his taxes? No - he has lied for years about that too. Mnuchin won't share them, but he happily provided Hunter Biden's, who's a ""private citizen"" and holds no gov't office. 

Meanwhile, the entire Trump Foundation had to shut down &amp; pay $millions in fines because it was proved (and they admitted it in court!) that they had misused nearly $3M from that telethon ""for veterans"" - y'know the one he set up while acting like a baby &amp; refusing to debate w/Meghan Kelley moderating? They just didn't send the money - he routed it through his business/foundation for tax write offs &amp; illegally campaign funds, and it took them getting caught by a media expose to get them to actually distribute the money. The entire Trump family is barred from running charities in NY. 

Still not enough for you? He has ruined international relations with our strongest allies, publicly admitted to illegally extorting foreign help in his re-election bid, publicly admitted to illegally firing whistle blowers, publicly praised dictators (Xi, Kim, Putin) and given massive propaganda victories to them. He has destroyed the State Dept and our diplomatic corps - personally and deliberately/publicly attacking dedicated public servants merely for doing their jobs and following US law, and sending unqualified donors to undercut longstanding US policy efforts. 

He has undermined the Constitution and rule of law, and routinely badmouths our military and our intelligence agencies. He routinely ""jokes"" about being able to do whatever he wants, and ""deserving"" a 3rd term, or unlimited terms. He doesn't give a  damn about US ideals or our institutions or our laws - only about himself.  

Dude \*lied about the fucking weather\* and put U.S. citizens in danger because he can't admit he's wrong. He lied about nearly starting a war w/Iran because he thought it would distract from his impeachment. He lied about the \~100+ U.S. troops who got brain injuries in the ensuing Iranian response. He openly threatened to commit war crimes in Iran. 

He is currently telling people to go to work w/highly communicable diseases and blaming a global epidemic on ""the Democrats"" because his followers are fucking stupid enough to believe it. His idiot admin overruled the CDC, and sent untrained, unprotected HHS staff to go chit-chat w/infected people, then take commercial flights home. His admin is almost certainly responsible for the initial ""unknown"" sources of the virus through their sheer arrogance and stupidity.  
""The economy is booming!""? After coasting on the strong Obama economy (6 straight years of growth!) for most of his presidency, wages are down, job growth is down. He started a stupid trade war (which we lost), and has personally tried to damage Boeing, Amazon, and other stocks out of personal spite. The stock market has seen multiple ""record drops"" under Trump - the worst since 2008, and in some cases the worst in US history. The DOW is down a record 4000 points in the past week due in part to his complete stupidity w/the Coronavirus. This administration's ineptitude wiped out literally the last 2 years of gains by putting a science-denying idiot in charge of the response.

They are literally (with no exaggeration of the word, but among other players) why healthcare in the US is unrealistically expensive, why there is so much red tape, and why doctors are furious with the system as well. They‚Äôre an unnecessary middle man who is ripping you off. 

The reason taxes would increase for everyone, including the middle class is because we still have to have a way to supplement Medicare for all....this along with closing corporate tax loopholes which could produce 10s of billions just from the top companies like Apple is how we pay for the system he proposes. Mind you the system we have now, is no cheaper to maintain. 

However, the increase in taxes would be MARGINAL relative to the average cost of monthly healthcare.
If private healthcare insurance goes away, that tax increase ain‚Äôt so big of a deal anymore. AND, you‚Äôre guaranteed care. An argument I see to that point often is, well you‚Äôd have to wait forever to get the care. Well, maybe, but you also do that in the current system. It‚Äôs not easy to see a neurologist or neurosurgeon for that burning knife stabbing pain or loss of sensation in your arm, it‚Äôs not easy to get into derm to have that skin cancer removed. 

We act like the current system is some smooth operating guarantee to good health. In reality it‚Äôs an abysmal, partially functioning system that completely exploits the sick person for money.  How can you support that business? Because that‚Äôs what it is, a business not a healthcare right as a citizen.

I‚Äôm not even going to address your housing comment because that‚Äôs some topical nonsense think right there. He doesn‚Äôt want full blown socialism, he wants socialistic healthcare, meaning the guaranteed right for citizens. That‚Äôs it. There are clear issues with the way renting and cost of living in general works in this country. They should be addressed to improve quality of life and the economy just like healthcare.

5260,KWAD2,"I‚Äôve dealt with government ran healthcare (tricare) and honestly it‚Äôs terrible. I almost died because of appendicitis. 


After that, I took out private insurance so I can actually see the doctors I want to see and when I can. Additionally it takes forever to schedule almost anything, it took them 5 months to get me scheduled for an optometrist. I‚Äôm a pilot, that‚Äôs ridiculous. 


So yeah, I don‚Äôt trust a government ran system on this so I still believe there should be access to private healthcare if desired. Plus that wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing. Let people choose the doctors they want. You don‚Äôt get that with universal.




Plus I don‚Äôt think taxpayers should foot the entire bill. Sure, some people will save money but others won‚Äôt. The system is broken with price gauging (like 500% on insulin) and there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to keep throwing kerosene on that fire. We should be treating healthcare like a utility, because it‚Äôs honestly a monopoly at this point. Lower the costs so it‚Äôs more affordable, and then there‚Äôs no reason to keep pumping more money into it.",1583622911,fjv3wrh

I appreciate your comments though, and as someone who really can‚Äôt stand Trump, I also agree that spin is real on both sides. Obama did in fact detain and separate kids too and was the prez during drone strikes that killed a lot of innocent civilians but oh lord Soleimani (the 2 face terrorist) was killed by Trump! I get it, the left is grabbing anything they can. 

Neither side impressed me. 

I like Bernie because as far as I can tell looking back through his history, he is honest and cares about the average joe in ways I don‚Äôt think any recent candidate has. Sure he‚Äôs been a career loser as some say but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs stuck to his guns-his morals. 

I as a young American want Bernie just for the fact that his policies and his attitude more importantly, will breath a lot of fresh air and change into people all over, not just America. 

Love is the answer. Bernie preaches a lot of love. It may not all be successful should he be elected, but the same shit hole policies have kept the average joe in a hard spot for half a century or longer and it‚Äôs clear Trump doesn‚Äôt really have plans to help the average joe and Biden the same-the both like the game they‚Äôre winning right now over that average joe, it‚Äôs time we tackle some change and stop being so terrified of it.",1583623074,fjv4eks

5284,shakrbait_78,"Teton Valley game warden Rob Howe has a pretty good idea of what led to a moose calf dying slowly and painfully last weekend just south of Driggs, Idaho.
The Idaho Department of Fish and Game employee got a call from a male resident Sunday who found the dead calf in his backyard. An unprotected haystack was on the property that likely caused the calf to stay there, and the warden put two and two together.
‚ÄúThis time of year moose are just like us, and they get really sick of the snow and they‚Äôve had enough, and they start to get ornery and aggressive and latch on to food sources,‚Äù Howe told the Jackson Hole Daily. ‚ÄúObviously, whoever shot it didn‚Äôt want the moose hanging around.‚Äù


The warden‚Äôs best guess is that the calf shooter didn‚Äôt intend to kill the animal, and that the person mistakenly thought that hitting it with birdshot on the backside would cause the animal to flee and no more.
But instead, the calf likely suffered slowly before succumbing to its wounds, which could have been inflicted many days before the animal died. Howe originally didn‚Äôt find evidence on Sunday that the moose was shot because the BBs were so small, but on Tuesday he did a more thorough necropsy and found the shotgun shell‚Äôs worth of pellets lodged inside the gutshot animal‚Äôs stomach lining. It was shot at close range, he said.


Two awards for information leading to the shooter are on the table, Howe said: one guaranteed award from Idaho Fish and Game‚Äôs Citizens Against Poaching program and a second undetermined pot of money being offered by a group of Driggs residents who are angry someone would do such a thing.
Howe‚Äôs hopeful that whoever killed the moose comes forward and admits to the shooting.
‚ÄúPeople make mistakes,‚Äù Howe said. ‚ÄúYou hear a lot of people preaching about personal responsibility, and it would be nice for the person who did it to have some integrity and give me a call.‚Äù
Poachers, he said, typically get off much easier if they‚Äôre forthcoming than if they have to be tracked down the hard way.
Tips can be phoned in to Howe at 208-390-0634 or to an anti-poaching hotline at 1-800-632-5999. Tipsters can be anonymous and still be eligible for the award.",1583633741,fjw2j0v

But even more to the point, the only reason I even commented to the SMS spam was to just get them to stop texting me every hour (with the wrong damn name even!). I did this with Bloomberg (saying I would support Bernie) and they dropped me from the texting lists, same for other candidates. its only been Bernie's supporters that had to try and come up with a ""biting"" come back.",1583812538,fk2yrqn

I‚Äôm not a Bernie bro, and I hope I don‚Äôt come off that way. Bernie Sanders however, truly is the most honest and considerate candidate choice for the average American looking to see improvements in their quality of life.

I support universal health care, I support much better education coverage (though perhaps not free tuition given how much of a political pill that would be). Politics is about leading ALL the people, not just the ones that like you and that is more important now than ever. A candidate that can't at least respect all the people they are planning on representing is not one I can vote for.

oh I know they are very different.  But look at what naturally flows into the other.  Many Socialist nations must devolve into communism because socialist policies require obedience to the state.  That necessitates a single party system to help funnel all decisions away from competing ideas and systems.

When you seize the means of production and employemnt is dictated by government mandates, then you are slowly eliminating the free market's abilities to more efficiently set prices and determine demand.  Socialist countries will always lag in responding to demand because it relies on bureaucracy to perform the function that a market responding to stimulus does.

These are made up phrases that mean absolutely nothing, but if you listen to CNN, they will be ingrained in your head. I have discussed with several Biden supporters and here is what I found: 

1. They cant really point to good policies Biden has. This mainly is due to him not having a platform (besides beat Trump). But it benefits him cause now he is a bit like Schrodinger's nominee. 
2. If you state a policy of Bernie's they will support it, until you mention it is Bernie's idea. Then it's too ""pie in the sky"" or ""radical."" This is because most of his policies are popular in nature. But with Bernie name they are commie nonsense. 

Another fairly common reason is classism. The middle class feel like they have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and worked hard to earn $12/hr. So if someone comes around offering everyone a living wage then they will make as much as a member of the poverty class. Same with healthcare. I work a full 40 hour for the privelege to spend 10% of my earnings on healthcare. You cant just give it to part time employees. I worked hard to pay for college and pay off my loans, so everyone should have to struggle like I did.

5798,StarWarsBruh,"I was a Yang supporter before he dropped out and Biden was nowhere near my second choice, but neither was Bernie. I ended up voting for Tulsi. But I will say that I like Biden more than Bernie and here‚Äôs why. 

The whole reason I loved Andrew Yang so much was he had plans to solve problems, and actual data and ways we would implement them. No other candidate (besides warren) had concrete plans for how they would implement their policies. Bernie Sanders didn‚Äôt support any of Yang‚Äôs ideas because he decided to double down on his policies even when he didn‚Äôt have a plan to pay for all of them. And on top of that, he let his surrogates and supporters smear and tear them down instead of pulling the progressives together and forming a formidable coalition.

I have only had positive interactions with Biden voters who respected my choice of candidate and the things they were fighting for. Biden is willing to look into nuclear power, including thorium reactors which would be safer and more efficient and environmentally friendly than uranium reactors. Biden also acknowledges the problem of automation and knows that it is taking jobs. Bernie is unwilling to change his stance on either of these problems. 

Another reason I don‚Äôt naturally vote for Bernie is because of his healthcare plan. I agree that healthcare is a human right and that all people should have access to it but I disagree with the implementation. His plan is to completely eliminate private insurance. Yang‚Äôs plan was to have a government healthcare plan but still keep private insurance for those who liked/preferred it. Bernie‚Äôs plan takes away choice from the American people and it doesn‚Äôt acknowledge those who took pay cuts in order to have a better healthcare plan from their job and those that don‚Äôt trust the government with their healthcare. 

That said, I plan on voting for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is because I believe we need to get trump out. I just have issues with some candidates more than others.",1584125923,fkf2vei

Granted thats slower but its still comparable to very infectious diseases like the common cold (3-7 days) or measles (7+ days). Then if you consider the r0 value, how contagious a disease is, it is on par if not exceeding the contagiousness of influenza. The 1918 H1N1 outbreak of influenza had an R0 value estimated at 1.4-2.8, COVID19 is estimated to have an R0 value between 2-3 with the WHO pegging it at 2.5. Long story short be careful out there.

&gt; Mr. Colvin is one of probably thousands of sellers who have amassed stockpiles of hand sanitizer and crucial respirator masks that many hospitals are now rationing, according to interviews with eight Amazon sellers and posts in private Facebook and Telegram groups from dozens more.

&gt; Sites like Amazon and eBay have given rise to a growing industry of independent sellers who snatch up discounted or hard-to-find items in stores to post online and sell around the world.

&gt; Mr. Colvin, 36, a former Air Force technical sergeant, said he started selling on Amazon in 2015, developing it into a six-figure career by selling Nike shoes and pet toys, and by following trends.

- aloe vera gel
- an essential oil, such as tea tree oil or lavender oil, or you can use lemon juice instead

* If you‚Äôre in a low risk group, it‚Äôs likely safe to go to restaurants who restructure their seating to allow diners to allow safe social distances.  
* If you‚Äôre in a higher risk group, many restaurants already do, or soon should offer curbside pickup so you can enjoy your favorite foods, and help ensure your favorite restaurant still exists after the epidemic without putting yourself at risk. 

Also, like you said, it‚Äôs not just about restaurant owners, it‚Äôs about dishwashers, servers and cooks who need jobs to pay the rent.

Another option is virtual desktops for everyone, hosted services like AWS Workspaces and WVD on Azure can be spun up quickly and should absolutely be considered as part of a BC/DR plan in the event that physical hardware is destroyed and cannot be replaced quickly, or there's a sudden need for additional workstations and a shortage of hardware.

An issue my company is facing right now is supply constraints for getting laptops to even provide, due to shortages there's only so many units even available. Thankfully we use VDI heavily and can have people access it directly from their personal systems, but these days it's not uncommon for people to not have a proper PC in their house and rely on their phone or tablet for internet usage so we still need them to provide them with a proper machine to access the virtual desktop with.",1584378551,fko202o

90%+ is an exaggeration (since over 25% of our statewide workforce is is office support and sales), but you're not wrong that in Idaho there's still a high amount of employment in farming, construction, maintenance, etc.

For those individuals that have no choice it's equally important that we get everyone who *can* work from home to do so, and deal with childcare for those who *cannot*. I honestly thought West Ada originally had the right idea of remaining open but allowing parents to pull their children out without penalty, but they should have been encouraging all parents to do so where feasible instead of ""well, the CDHD says everything is fine, but if you *really* want to pull your kid out..."".

The goal is, after all, to *slow* the spread of the disease to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system. We don't need to shutdown everything to do that, but we should be making it possible for as many people as possible to isolate themselves.",1584379483,fko3nph

6219,CultistHeadpiece,"&gt; Not only should they have shut down schools

When parents have to go to work and the school is closed, someone has to watch over the kids and it‚Äôs often grandparents. Many kids are already carriers so when you close the schools, all that‚Äôs accomplishing is exposing the virus to their grandparents who would have been isolated otherwise.

&gt; they should have shut down bars, restaurants, movie theaters, and other luxury or entertainment venues. 

Most people are already staying at home and avoiding large gatherings of people and most of these who go out are very cautious about getting close to others, washing hands etc.

At some point shutting down businesses by force for prolonged periods of time will cause more harm than good. It will bankrupt them, people lose jobs etc. Now they get at least a little bit of revenue, even tho they probably operate at a negative anyway.

Also:

&gt; Experts have warned about the risk that if tough measures are taken too soon, ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù may set in, prompting the public to disregard the advice just as the virus reaches its peak.

Effectively the argument is that, absent some sort of enforcement squad if people are told to stay in lockdown for a significant period, without a significant scare factor to justify it, then people will assume the risk is actually overblown and start mingling again, just at the moment that many of them are at their most contagious, starting a whole new outbreak in the herd of uninfected.

Also, no one at the state or local level has warned about kids infecting grandma and grandpa. 

People are still going out drinking and packing bars. No one has told them to do otherwise, forget shutting them down, just ask people to stay home and avoid old people.

Yes, the dollars will equal $1000. But that $1000 bike will no longer cost $1000, it will cost $10,000 because the value of the dollar has gone down so drastically due to the amount in existence. For example, $10 Zimbabwe used to be able to buy a sandwich. By the end of the collapse, you needed $10,000,000 to buy that same sandwich.

6514,Liggliluff,"I can describe how it actually works in Sweden, well, from what I know. We both have limited knowledge.

The income tax is about 30%. There's no state income tax. I can't find anything about luxury tax. But there is property tax and sales tax. No tax on inheritance. ‚Äì But the first 1900 USD/year you earn are tax free. The minimum wage in Idaho is 7.25 USD/hour, compared to my minimum wage in Sweden which was 11.35 USD/hour. ‚Äì So if two people work for minimum wage for 2500 hours/year (48 hours/week). Using smartasset.com, 18125 USD results in 15964 USD take-home in Idaho. Using ekonomifakta.se, 113 500 USD results in 15135 USD take-home in Stockholm. So people getting paid minimum wage still ends up getting paid about the same after tax.

But yes, sales tax are higher in Sweden at 25% compared to Idaho at 6%, so that would be 75% useful payments compared to 94%. Food is only taxed at 12%, but still 6% in Idaho, so that's 88% compared to 94%. ‚Äì Property tax is 1.5% in Stockholm and 1.438% in Idaho, very similar. ‚Äì But then we don't have to pay as much for other expenses. Numbers I can find; private school in Idaho costs 8501 USD/year, while free in Sweden. Idaho reduces your tax by 205 USD/year per child you have, while Sweden reduces by 1508 USD/year for 1 child, and 3196 USD/year for 2 children, and so on. You pay on average 6240 USD/year for health insurance in Idaho, while it's free in Sweden, well you can still get an insurance for certain cases where some people pay 1507 USD/year. I've also heard that you can be transferred to a hospital not covered by your insurance, so you have to pay for it all, which isn't something that would happen in Sweden to my knowledge. A bonus is also that within EU, as a EU citizen, you have access to the same rights to health care in any EU country as the citizens of that country has. Sweden gives you the right to 5 weeks of paid vacation from work, so the person earning 113500 USD/year the previous year will get paid 2951 USD/week during the vacation. Idaho does not give you the right to vacation (that is up to the companies themselves), and I cannot find information regarding how much you should be paid if you are given vacation. A nice thing is also that you don't have to do your taxes in Sweden; you get a pre-filled sheet that you can look over to make sure everything is in order, and confirm by phone/online/office.

Looking at all this, it will be very complicated trying to figure out who is really paying more money. It's all dependent on how much you earn, how your lifestyle is. USA is more going your own race and handle your own life; while in Sweden it's more about having stuff served for you, so you can relax. I cannot say that one is better than the other, it's more up to what you want. ‚Äì But if you are a very rich person, then I can understand why you would prefer USA.

Then you got statistics about the quality of countries, such as best health care (WHO): Sweden is 23rd, USA is 37th. Best education (globalpartnership): Sweden has 1486 points, USA has 1489 points.

I for one do not trust the US government that is corrupt and extremely awful with money with my healthcare. Medicare for All would place 1 million people without jobs and cause an immediate and severe recession, would decrease the salary of healthcare providers by 40% which include doctors, nurses and social workers and would substantially raise taxes. Do you think we will continue to see students go into medicine or nursing for a little more half the pay? There is already a shortage of doctors and nurses, take away their incentive and see how severe our shortage becomes. Our system isn‚Äôt perfect but because it‚Äôs a business it innovates, brings new medicines and treatment to market and leads the world in advanced and specialized healthcare which would be stripped away with socialized medicine. The ER wait times would double or likely quadruple, instead of getting an MRI within a 1-2 days it could be 6-12 months, a cardiac stent procedure for heart attacks takes place less than 90 mins once you‚Äôre diagnosed with could take up to a month which is beyond the therapeutic window and the cardiac damage instead of reversed is permanent.

Even worse than doctors would be the loss of nurses. Nursing is an incredibly difficult job and our nurses do it so well.

Normally I'd say shut up and follow the unemployment process. I'd also say unemployment should be much better scrutinized and ppl should show hard evidence that they asked for jobs prior to getting a check.

But these are not normal times. These are unprecedented times. Unfortunately the Gov't is the only entity that can help.  Private Enterprise is all but handcuffed. Things are happening that we could have never imagined, like fed taxes not due till July, etc..

This is like most idiotic Facebook posts &amp; old chain emails:

It:

1. contains well-known names and places (often w/some errors)
2. is peppered with hints of truth to make it seem plausible.
3. Is unsourced, undated, and has no known author
4. combines a bunch of unrelated crap &amp; opinions, hoping you'll *draw your own* sinister conclusions and buy in to their moronic, racist, partisan narrative. Its goal is to spin up partisan, racist, fear-mongering, bullshit to convince (older, conservative in this case) stupid people they should be scared of ""the others"" and feel like victims.

This is how a lot of partisan propaganda works. Innuendo, bullshit, fear, and scapegoats.

Now sprinkle in hints of truth:

Why ""John Kerry""? Because the target audience might know from Fox News that he worked on the Iran nuclear deal. Did he meet Iranian officials in Munich? [Yes. Back in 2015-2017](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=John+Kerry+Iran+Munich). Has nothing to do with any of this.

Does that Netflix show exist? [Yes.](https://nypost.com/2020/01/23/netflix-releases-pandemic-docuseries-as-coronavirus-spreads/) Did it have anything at all to do w/Bill Gates or Obama? No - it's a Netflix original by the company that made Anthony Bourdain's fucking cooking show.

Why Bill Gates? Because he's famous &amp; has been the subject of chain letter bullshit since the 90s. He has worked with global health NGOs for years. The US focal point when this crap was probably first written was in WA state, so why not?

Yup, he has been [talking publicly about pandemic preparedness](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2018/04/Shattuck-Lecture-Innovation-for-Pandemics) for years, and yes they made predictive models in 2018 saying how hospitals worldwide were under-prepared for the next pandemic &amp; should prepare. He was right. He also [talked to members of the Trump admin back in 2018](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/04/27/bill-gates-calls-on-u-s-to-lead-fight-against-a-pandemic-that-could-kill-millions/) to advocate for the kind of response team &amp; capabilities that Trump stupidly got rid of.

Gates was exactly right, as we have seen hospitals overwhelmed in Italy &amp; Spain. Note BTW that EU countries aren't mentioned in the bullshit above, because it 1) doesn't fit the racist anti-China focus and 2) it probably hadn't happened yet - this was likely written a few weeks ago.

Were 19 of 21 Oakland cruise ship cases crew? [True](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-09/what-we-know-about-grand-princess-docking-coronavirus-quarantine). 1 staff member caught it from [1 infected guy on the previous cruise (who became the first person to die in CA)](https://www.businessinsider.com/california-reports-first-coronavirus-death-sacramento-cruise-2020-3), and then infected his crew mates on the subsequent trip. That's how viruses work. ""Who put them there""? Um, the same people who always schedule the employees to go do their jobs? Why is that weird? What does this have to do with anything? It's irrelevant, but it's a ""bit of truth"" up front to make the racist crap that follows seem more reasonable. It's framing.

Did Korea's outbreak start with some ""cult""? Well, kind of - it started in a church because stupid people refused to listen to quarantine rules &amp; kept congregating in large numbers.

Note there's no mention of Korea shutting down their outbreak w/a rapid response &amp; widespread testing that we have refused to follow - they only mention the cult church.

Did it impact Hong Kong protests? Yes, but if that was the goal,  why center it in the middle of China and not in HK? Makes no sense. Did it change anything in Taiwan? No - they actually followed basic medical science guidelines and have had few cases. They also, btw, have a great national healthcare system, just like most of the EU, which isn't even mentioned in this diatribe but has 1000s of cases.

Are there ""real videos"" of people in China protesting the government's response? Yes, but note that 1) this rant doesn't link to any of them 2) it mischaracterizes them as saying the whole thing is fake. But we've seen the doctor who tried to blow the whistle on its severity &amp; subsequently died. China can't both try to contain &amp; minimize it, and simultaneously blow it out of proportion to scare the west - that doesn't make sense. 

Do you need more proof that stupid people will post the dumbest shit imaginable on Facebook as if its gospel truth, but then won't listen to doctors and epidemiologists? It's propaganda to keep gullible, old, vaguely racist Conservatives scared of ""the others."" That's all.

Meanwhile, Trump &amp; Fox News have been openly lying to the public on camera for days about testing and supplies and some fake &amp; untested/unverified ""cure.""

That is the french study.  I think the 100% figure you might be referring to is on page 11.  It does state that of the patients who remained in the study, 100% of the ones who received both drugs (all 6 people - it was a TINY study) had no detectable trace of the virus in a nasal swab.  But that ignores the deaths and transfers to ICU, and it ignores the fact that just because you are no longer shedding (have the virus present in your nasal passages) doesn't mean that you no longer have the virus in your system.  Also, the death and severe illness cases were actually a HIGHER percentage than the population at large, which is terrible, considering it wasn't a blind study, so the placebo effect alone should have had some effect.  Besides which, the sample size is so small as to be statistically meaningless.  

I'm not at all saying the drugs may not work in the end, but we ABSOLUTELY do not know anything for certain yet, and touting it as a 100% effective drug is flat out wrong at best, and could lead to further people trying to self medicate and dying from the medication, at worst.

If you eat aquarium cleaner, or tide pods, or lemon-scented pledge for vitamin C, it is your fault when you die.

The drug works, it's proven effective. Taking it alongside aquarium cleaner poison is not what the President said to do by any measure. And he didn't tell people to run out and eat products that contain it as an additive.

Blaming the president for stupid people ingesting poison is peak TDS.

And I'm not blaming Cuomo, because what he said is that they are starting trials, and he is hopeful that it COULD work.  Starting trials is a fact, and he is hopeful is clearly his opinion, and even then, he qualified it with COULD work.  He said there is reason to think it could work, which is true, and the reason why it is on the list of drugs being studied as possibilities.  He also said ""We don't know, but let's find out"".  That's a long way from ""touting the effectiveness"". Do you see the difference between that and what Trump said?

I agree people are responsible for their own actions.  I said I agreed this guy in Arizona was a moron.  But his wife stated that they took it because of Trump's statement.

We need Idaho Governor Little to issue and enforce a mandatory statewide social distancing order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Idaho, joining the growing list of 21 other states with similar measures. If swift and decisive action is not taken now, Governor Little is increasing the risk that our great Idaho hospitals become overrun, that more healthcare workers get sick, that more Idahoans end up with a severe illness, and that more Idahoans end up dead.

We, Idaho's healthcare workers, nurses, physicians, first responders, veterans, senior citizens, vulnerable, truck drivers, lawyers, service industry, farmers, loggers, business owners, workers, students, and other concerned citizens are demanding Governor Little to lockdown Idaho now.
Give Idaho a fighting chance! We only have one shot at this!

As Idaho cases dramatically increase and our testing ramps up, thousands of Idahoans are still not practicing social distancing and are not taking the measure seriously enough. Now that schools have closed and as the weather gets warmer, too many people are still gathering in 10+ groups at parks, meeting friends at the bar, hiking on crowded paths, partying at Salmon River beaches, escaping to our mountain towns, congregating in neighborhoods, hanging out with groups of friends at home, and unnecessarily traveling to other Idaho communities- all ignoring your polite suggestions for everyone to do their part to flatten the curve. It is not working.

The virus does not care about social distancing talk, local restrictions, city limits, or county lines... if the virus's host does not either. 

Governor Little, we need tougher measures enforced now! Every hour that people are out transmitting the virus adds weeks to how long this will last ‚Äì and exponentially more carnage. Statewide Idaho only has roughly 155-244 ICU beds available, only 404 ventilators, and extremely limited amount of protective equipment for our healthcare workers. Guess what happens if more rural hospitals are forced to suspend operations, like in Ketchum, Idaho? Guess what happens to Idahoans that need an ICU bed and don't get one? These people are us!

Please protect us. Please prevent more of our friends and family from dying. Prevent more health care workers from getting sick. Prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Please prevent doctors from choosing who gets a ventilator. Please save our Ida-home.",1585132416,flg6arc

The entire point of self-isolation is to buy time. 

There‚Äôs a roughly 3-week lag between widespread infection and waves of people hitting the ICU in need of ventilators and emergency care, which we don‚Äôt have enough of. 

ID is roughly 2 weeks behind WA, CA, NY, which are 2-3 weeks behind Italy - we can see what will happen. 

Italy: didn‚Äôt test, isolate, close businesses or lock down until they already had 100s dying each day. Hospitals got overwhelmed, people who need care can‚Äôt get it, they &amp; healthcare workers are dying, and it‚Äôs chaos. They‚Äôre also the source of a lot of spread around Europe because nobody stayed the fuck home when told. People went skiing instead and spread it. Sounds like here. 

S. Korea: instead tested *everyone* early on, identified &amp; isolated positive cases *before* they even felt sick or could infect a dozen others, didn‚Äôt overwhelm their hospitals and didn‚Äôt have to worry about a run on toilet paper or nationwide lockdowns. Singapore did the same w/similar results. We can see this is what works. We‚Äôve refused to bother ‚Äúbecause stock market.‚Äù

This only has a ‚Äúhuge recovery rate‚Äù IF we do the right things. We are not. 

It has a 2-4% mortality rate and is more contagious than the flu or a cold. If we do nothing at all, that‚Äôs MILLIONS dead across the US.

That doesn‚Äôt even count additional deaths from cancer, car crashes, heart attacks, flu, etc because people can‚Äôt get into the ER or on a ventilator because the hospitals are full of COVID-19 patients.

Think that will have a huge impact on the economy?

If people stay home for a few weeks &amp; do the right things, instead of Holocaust-level deaths it‚Äôs more like 50K across the US and maybe a few 100 or 1000 in ID. 

Why? 
Buying time &amp; freeing capacity. 

Sitting on your couch &amp; eating ramen for a piddly 3 weeks instead of everyone infecting everyone helps avoid immediately overwhelming our entire woefully unprepared healthcare system in the next 2-3 weeks when symptoms start. 

We can instead hopefully trickle in only the worst cases, and use that time to produce more equipment (ventilators, masks, etc), free up &amp; create more hospital capacity, and make more progress on a vaccine/treatments. Hopefully we‚Äôll be better prepared if there‚Äôs a big wave a month from now when we all can go back to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù
(By delaying &amp; refusing, we‚Äôre wasting that time). 

The other critical goal is to take the strain off healthcare workers all being smacked at once w/long shifts &amp; high exposure due to inadequate equipment. If we wear them all out in the next month and they start dying who takes over? 

BTW no, this doesn‚Äôt only impact people ‚Äúwith a compromised immune system.‚Äù It is putting healthy, young, athletic people in the hospital. 20% of hospitalizations &amp; 50% of cases are adults under 50. Yes, most recover, but all of them probably infected a dozen other people before they even felt sick, which is the whole problem.

Kids are supposed to be learning at home (it was going to be spring break regardless). State &amp; federal govts are passing emergency measures to delay mortgage &amp; tax &amp; utility payments and to pay out individuals and businesses. States are changing unemployment laws. Supply lines would‚Äôve been fine if people hadn‚Äôt freaked out and bought 3yr supplies of toilet paper for some reason.

People can have it and not show symptoms for up to two weeks, and be spreading it to others, especially vulnerable populations.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to understand is that it has exponential growth. With this type of growth, the biggest questions is *how fast is it doubling?* Currently, the U.S. and Idaho are both doubling about every three days, and has been that way for a while. If we do nothing, that exponential growth rate will likely stay the same. That means, a month from now (30 days), we will double 10 times, which means 91 cases turns into 93,184 cases.

&amp;#x200B;

This website is updated regularly with new numbers and goes into great detail about the statistics and measurements behind the numbers:  [https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, confirmed cases is not very reliable. A more consistent measurement is confirmed deaths. Idaho doesn't have any yet, but we will. The confirmed deaths in the U.S. is also doubling every three days. As I write this, the confirmed deaths in the U.S. is 801. Doubling 10 times in a month will bring that total to 820,224. Another 3 days, and we're past 1 million. Hopefully, we take decisive action to slow the rate of this exponential growth.

&amp;#x200B;

This website matches up local hospital bed data with local demographic data and data about COVID-19.  [https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-hospitals](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-hospitals)

&amp;#x200B;

Slowing the spread is essential to helping the hospitals deal with the influx of cases. If more people need hospitalization than beds are available, we're going to have more people dying because they cannot get the healthcare they need. Our local healthcare system does not have the capacity to care for the percentage of those who need hospitalized if most people get sick in a short amount of time (6 months), which is what will happen if we do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

The disease seems to have a case fatality rate of 2 percent (which would be a lot higher once we run out of room to care for those who could possibly have been saved). If we do nothing and the majority of U.S. residents get it, that's about 6 million people who will die.

Also, there is zero way Idaho ever hits the numbers New York is hitting. Especially with how we are testing. Also with many under 50-60 having extremely mild cases. There is a chance many people in the country already had it back in February or January.

Encourage people to work from home. Limit large gatherings 10 or less and make restaurants do takeout, drive-thru, and curbside. Which is what Idaho has suggested. Again at this time a lockdown is not required. Many states are not in lockdown and just practicing social distancing and are doing fine.

Because people assume that lower population means we don‚Äôt need to do as much to prevent spread.

7501,gentlephish01,"Perhaps they should have had enough money saved up to handle 3 months of unemployment ^(/s)

I don't think actual literal human lives are less valuable than businesses staying open. An economy can recover, dead people cannot. We have a government for a reason anyway, businesses don't need to shutter their windows if there's a national or statewide debt/rent/utility freeze.

Yes the funny line will go down if we do this, but that's worth protecting the lives of hundred of thousands, if not millions of people. We have 900,000 hospital beds in the us. Let's round that up to 1 million. Conservative estimates have 1/3 of the US population, or \~100 million people getting sick. Current numbers are that about 1 in 5 people need hospitalization. That's 20 million people, or 20 times our hospital capacity. That's much more than the 2-3% who can't be saved even in a hospital who will die. It would be 6% of the entire US population dead. And that doesn't even include the serious accidents and chronic sick that are already in the hospital or will need one to survive.

Say we pull that 6%, or 19 million, out to the whole calendar year. During that time, based on previous data, there will be about 2.8 million people having serious accidents, 1.5 million strokes and heart attacks, 1.8 million people diagnosed with cancer, and another half a million with a serious case of influenza. All told, that will be 8% of the entire US population dying because there's not enough hospital beds, because we didn't work in a systemic manner to contain the outbreak.

I'd rather see a recession or depression than nearly 1 in 10 Americans die. The economy will recover. My parents and friends won't.",1585154700,flh2627
7502,ActualSpiders,The lockdown won't do shit once numbers are that high. The lockdown is for keeping our numbers from _getting_ that high.,1585154820,flh2eas
7503,j0sephl,"&gt;If we do nothing and the majority of U.S. residents get it, that's about 6 million people who will die. To do nothing, to not take great action to help slow the spread

That's is a big if. There are still a lot of questions about this virus. Also, the same reason you state about exponential growth is the same reason we can't infer the actual 100% confidence in the spreading of the virus yet. The only thing you can say right now with a firm knowledge is when we test more we find more confirmed cases. On top of that, we are not doing nothing. Many states in higher hit areas have locked down. Also, the majority of states have enacted social distancing programs. A majority of Americans are probably working from home.

My point is that not having a lockdown doesn't mean we are not doing nothing. If medical officials felt like that should happen in Idaho it would have happened. Again people keep forgetting the economy in all of this. You have to take that into account when you make a decision like a lockdown. Businesses are already suffering under social distancing plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The disease seems to have a case fatality rate of 2 percent (which would be a lot higher once we run out of room to care for those who could possibly have been saved). 

That is only part of the story. You also need to break out the mortality rate into the age brackets. It's still way more deadly than the flu though. Also, your mortality rate is off. WHO has it listed at 3.4% as of March 3rd. Broken out by age.

* **80+ years old - 21.9% (CONFIRMED CASES) 14.8% (ALL CASES)**
* **70-79 years old - 8.0%**
* **60-69 years old - 3.6%**
* **50-59 years old - 1.3%**
* **40-49 years old - 0.4%**
* **30-39 years old - 0.2%**
* **20-29 years old -0.2%**
* **10-19 years old - 0.2%**

Again I have NOT said to do nothing. All I am saying is we need to play this smart. We have to weigh so many other aspects besides protecting people from getting sick. I for one would like for you and I to have a job after this is all done.",1585155039,flh2td1

7771,joetwocrows,"I shouldn't do this, but why not; I'm at home complying with the order, and am mildly bored.  Bear with me, this gets long, and is in two parts. 

First, let me quote the OP: 

"" How do you guys feel about this? Do you think he needs to take a more heavy-handed approach, like a shelter in place order?  ""

That's asking for opinions.  When you say ""there's no opinion here"", either a) you haven't actually read the top post, only my response, or b) your (unstated) opinion is there is (or should be) only one (unstated) course of action, that my view of the situation is obviously uninformed (sort of stated), and I should do my homework so my opinion agrees with yours, despite not knowing what your opinion. 

In either case, it's dismissive and not respectful, and perhaps you could consider carefully why you are being so.  Especially in being dismissive and not explanatory.  We are all in a very serious situation, and challenging responses without backing up your assertions do not help find a safe community response to its needs.  

Second, your assumptions regarding my knowledge.  

For all you know, 'cuz Reddit, I could be a medical professional with years of training in infectious disease.  So, your response "" Might be useful for you to do some further research. "" could be at best embarrassing for you.  But, I am not, so "" Might be useful for you to do some further research. "" is in fact accurate, but not because my opinion is 'wrong', but because it's always good to research further.  

The converse it true; you could be the infectious disease specialist; allow me my doubt. 

Now, let's examine what I do know about the spread and effect of the virus.  I'm happy to share, are you? 

1.  The virus is considered to have an average incubation (time from exposure to symptomatic onset) period of 5 days. ([who.int](https://who.int)), but carriers may be infectious in as little as 3 days, but not show symptoms for up to 14 days.  
2. The virus is highly contagious, but I can't find a reliable transmission rate,  and is spread via airborne droplets or close contact (within about 2m - if only PigPen knew). ([healthline.org](https://healthline.org)).  It's not yet confirmed, but is suspected the virus can be transmitted via intermediary surface contact (you touch something, then I touch the same thing.  
3. The virus RNA has been shown to remain intact on undisinfected, inert surfaces for up to 17 days.  (multiple news outlets, Princess Cruise Lines)  That doesn't confirm it can spread by intermediary contact, but I would disinfect things.  
4. In Idaho, the state Coronavirus site updates once a week with confirmed cases, while health district sites update daily with reported/suspected cases.  The health district numbers are much higher than the state site, at least in part because of the difference in reporting criteria.  
5. The infection can cause symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to death, with the most severe cases requiring intensive respiratory care to have any chance of survival.  
6. The rate of severe cases is large enough that left unchecked, or only partially controlled the number of suitable intensive care facilities will be exceeded before the maximum number of cases resulting in a higher fatality rate than if adequately controlled. (Flattening the curve, multiple sources).  That lovely graphic only omits an increase in facilities, but the rate of bringing new intensive care facilities online is so slow it can be neglected.  
7. There are some recent (1-3 days) graphics that show how different isolation policies affect the various infection and death rates.  (MIT Technology Review).   If we accept that graph, than nothing we do will reduce the number of severe cases adequately.  I don't accept that graph but it is instructive.  
8. Population density has a significant effect on incidence.  Consider this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2020/03/22/population-adjusted-coronavirus-cases-top-10-countries-compared/#7d17e648974f) . It's intuitive that lower population means fewer cases, but not so intuitive on how the density plays into it.  

OK.  So, that's bit, not all, but a bit, about what I know about how the virus spreads.  Is that a good start on my research?  Yes, I'm being snarky. 

I'm going look at the last point, population density in a little more detail.  

1. On KTVB's interactive map, as good of a source as any, 27 of Idaho's 44 counties have 0 (zero) reported cases.  That's 56% are clean.  We know this isn't true, but we work with what we have. 
2. Nearly all of the clean counties have very low population densities.  Camas County?  Please.  That means, among many things, that the residents as a natural course of the day do not interact with many other people.  I know of no statistics in this area, perhaps it would be a good research topic.  
3. Low interaction means low transmission rate.  I make that assertion because if it is not true than all the stay-at-home/quarantine orders are not useful.  
4. Low population density probably means low urbanization, that is, rural areas.  

I think you see where I'm going with this, so I'll quit here.  The point is, I have, in fact, done considerable research and if my considered and researched opinion disagrees with yours, or if you think my research is insufficient, please provide your sources.  That's the nature of discourse.",1585202999,flj92f2

No national forest has closed itself off, nor has any BLM lands.  There's plenty of room out there.

I get the need to get away, believe me.  I drove for 2 hours and 45 minutes one way to find a quiet spot last weekend.  I think we need the outdoors more than ever right now.  It's just that the campgrounds, as I said before, are very difficult to keep clean at this time, and leaving them open puts a higher risk group into a situation where they could pick up COVID.

Asked about stopping evictions-Nothing is currently being done about it is in talks with the property managers though has advised them it's not a good idea to evict people right now. 

Asked about renters associations and anything with their regulations changing-currently nothing is.

Stressed the stay at home order wants to really get the word out there. Won't be providing Estimate of the unemployment numbers until they are confirmed as the draft numbers have negative effects on the markets (said during press conference by member of his Corona Team)

I really think some better questions could of been asked, like are people following the stay at home order? (they probably have some sort of statistic for this) Have they thought about changing the enforcement of the stay at home order if people consistently aren't taking it seriously? Will people be fined for not following it soon?

He was asked about how quickly they can get supplies over to the healthcare centers that are lacking equipment in Blaine County and his response was 5 minutes (really hope that's accurate they are hurting for important equipment hopefully that means they are getting it soon)

7954,ShenmeNamaeSollich,"Note that at the end of the day Gov Little announced the stay-at-home order (Wed 25th), we had 123 cases. As of Fri evening (27th) we have 230 cases (&amp; 4 deaths). 

We are exactly on the path of cases doubling roughly every 3 days. 

For anyone who still thinks this is bullshit and ‚Äújust the flu,‚Äù this is the exact same progression seen in NYC, Italy, Spain, and several other countries - we‚Äôre just a few weeks behind. 

At this rate we‚Äôd have ~500 by late Monday &amp; ~1000 by the end of next week. Next week also marks 3 weeks since the first confirmed cases in the state, so we should start seeing more people w/serious symptoms.

My question is: what‚Äôs the plan to USE the time we‚Äôre trying to buy to prep for a better response? We haven‚Äôt been doing enough testing or enough isolating, and we don‚Äôt have enough equipment or hospital beds. 

We have the benefit of seeing what results from not doing the right things early. It‚Äôs good that Gov Little put his order in place as relatively soon as he did, but we also need to actively act and do something with the foresight we have - otherwise it‚Äôs wasted. 

Waiting for Federal response is a non-starter with this administration - Trump‚Äôs a criminally vindictive moron who is actively preventing a proper response. 

So, DIY. Can HP make ventilators? How about 3D printers for making ventilator parts? How about their [current or former] employees right here in Boise who have engineering backgrounds and are sitting at home? Some Boise-area libraries have 3D printers - surely some businesses do too. Start evaluating &amp; making the open-source parts (hose splitters &amp; face masks &amp; valves, etc) already popping up online. Make them NOW and test/train people on them NOW so we have things in place in a few weeks. Make them now &amp; start shipping them to other states because we have the time &amp; capacity &amp; expertise to do so.

This is not a jab at anybody with this wonderful opportunity, but I am afraid this entire process is revealing some very ugly truths of our local and federal government.  I am a landscape designer/project manager, I am not essential.  I have heard the argument, we keep areas safe - yes, maybe 2% of the time, removing tree limbs, in which case we would be essential. Many business owners know we are not essential, and are of course taking advantage of the opportunity to continue operations as usual.  I, again, understand everyone wants to continue getting paid but I am terribly afraid that until it gets worse, we will not take action.

If you don‚Äôt like working to support your nation and your fellow citizens (and having them do the same for you) I don‚Äôt know why you would stay in a socialist country. Alternatively if they could did not wish to or could not for any reason, they could continue to live with likely less payoff of the system they chose to disengage themselves from. If you‚Äôre taking corporatists who would manipulate the system via illegal exploitation of workers, they would likely be fined/jailed for their criminal acts the same as you would if you tried to fuck the system in any country. That‚Äôs not unique to socialism. 

Only three countries in the world protect the right to bear arms in their constitution explicitly. For most nations it‚Äôs just not that much of an issue when compared to things like healthcare, human rights, environmental and economic policy, ect. The truth is, most countries, socialist or not, just don‚Äôt care as much as Americans do about guns. Many Socialists value gun rights but they aren‚Äôt single issue voters, and some are willing to conciliate absolute freedoms under specific circumstances. As for what those circumstances are they vary from group to group, and you would have to ask which ones specifically you wanted to know about. 

Many democratic socialist countries like the nordics have restricted gun ownership in that you must have a documented use for a gun (sport and hunting being the most common), which I personally don‚Äôt have a major gripe with but some socialists may disagree with. Note however that you are still very much allowed to have a gun, you just have to be of age, without a history of mental illness or a criminal background, and say what you want it for.

Idaho, like a good many states, handles more than sports through their state association.  It‚Äôs about a 60-40 split there and the trend is to go, like Idaho, with having a broader base extercirruclar organization.  Anyway, the goal of all high school sports organizations, governing bodies, schools and teams is not to see who can ‚Äúwin‚Äù a game, match, event, competition or contest.  That would be way, way down on the list of goals - if it made it at all.  First are the practical goals:  participation on a school team or a school activity (marching band, cheer, drama, art) improves attendance and grades.  It also helps with inclusion and self-worth.  It helps keep kids out of trouble.  Participation also helps with all sorts of secondary issues like teaching the value of teamwork and sportsmanship, and effort to better yourself. All of that is just for starters. No where is ‚Äúwinning‚Äù listed.  Why?  Because it‚Äôs not important.  

Now, Idaho has passed a law taking a very small group of kids and deciding, ‚Äúthose kids‚Äù cannot benefit from participating in a high school sport unless they play as someone they are not.  How many trans kids do you have in Idaho?  Kids who live day in and day out as trans?  Kids who a school counselor would attest lives their life as trans?  And, now, how many of them would like to participate on a school team?  If you had 10 in any given year I would be surprised.  But, life‚Äôs not difficult enough for an openly trans kid in high school in Idaho; let‚Äôs make it even more likely they will be ostracized and commit suicide.  This will be super fun right?

However, that trans athlete will not have had the physiological changes one undergoes in the womb, such as skeletal mass and increased muscle mass growth.

Imagine you are a college. You want the best athletes at your school as athletics generate a massive income for you. If a female trans athlete is better than one who is not trans you will recruit the better of the two. Because, it gives your university clout, it increases revenue from tournaments, and can lead to television deals for whole athletic conferences.

While it may be good to leave it up to colleges I would not like people who have a ""horse in the race"" to police themselves. It's like saying let the free market regulate itself, most people would say that's a bad idea.

You're going to over complicate everything with obscure language, aren't you? Hold on Sheldon...

1) Intersectionality: the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.

2) Marxism: the political and economic theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, later developed by their followers to form the basis for the theory and practice of communism.

So I imagine you're not a fan of Sesame Street? 

.

The point I'm making is that you're not saying anything if the sentence can be interpreted 1000 different ways.

Imagine what you'll know tomorrow"". I think keeping a mind that is curious is very helpful. I am excited to someday read the reports of effects of this global crisis and all that we learned from it. It makes some sense to me that given the effects of our daily habits, especially those that pollute, stopping or rapidly reducing those same habits would also have effects on our environments. In general, thinking that we ""know"" something closes our minds to learning and locks us into a possibly - likely - outdated model of understanding.

Segregation, unequal enforcement of laws, redlining, and widespread bigotry. When your financial situation has less to do with individual choice and more to do with how society has beaten down your parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, you can‚Äôt really say your situation is equal to someone who‚Äôs family hasn‚Äôt had to face the same obstacles. Economic situations are often generational, so this idea that any single individual can magically pull themselves out of poverty regardless of their familial history is nonsense.

8822,CToxin,"The problem with this stuff is two fold:

1: there is very little if any evidence that trans women have an unfair advantage in these sports. Yes, there are theories, but because of sample size its virtually non existent. Reminder that, well last I checked, not a single trans woman was able to qualify for the Olympics, despite all the fear mongering about them. The lawsuit in question, the girl came in fourth. She wouldn't have won regardless. And the transgirl's performance was well in line with other highschool girls.

2: These types of bills also ostracize intersex people and those who simply have some advantageous traits. It also creates this idea that you can be ""too good"" at women's sports, which is kinda sexist imo. No one complained about Phelps having an advantage from his genetics.

Oh, and sports associations already have standards regarding transgender athletes. There is no reason for the state to get involved in this stuff.

Also the bill in particular allows for others to demand a purity test from an athlete, to prove that they aren't trans, which the accused is responsible for paying for. It includes a pelvic/genital exam and hormone level checking (ffs, trans women on HRT have lower T levels than cis women. this is stupid. what about women who just have naturally high T levels?).

Like, if a trans woman transitioned pre-puberty, she would have zero male secondary traits. But because of laws like this a woman like that would be unable to compete, for no reason other than bepis (which last I checked isn't used in any sports outside the bedroom).

The purpose of bills like this isn't at all to do with fairness, but to kick trans people back in the closet and otherize us more, and appeal to the bigoted voting base.",1585723211,fm3gzzz

You don't need to measure chemicals in the body to understand a child in utero undergoes different changes depending on their chromosomes.

That's not how biology works. Go back to school.

&gt; For someone born a man that means they have testosterone, so they will naturally have more muscle mass, a larger skeletal frame, and other natural advantages a man has physically.

False, that is a secondary trait, not a primary one. Also that muscle mass goes away pretty fast when you transition.

9028,maliciouslawnmower,"Idaho has become the first state in the United States to bar transgender girls from participating in girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs sports and to legalize the practice of asking girls and women to undergo sex testing in order to compete.

The house bill, known as the Fairness in Women‚Äôs Sports Act, was signed by Gov. Brad Little on Monday. Governor Little also signed a bill that prohibits transgender people from changing their birth certificates to match their gender identities.

While many states have introduced bills to restrict the participation of transgender athletes, Idaho is the first state to have passed such legislation into law.

Despite a movement in broader society toward endorsing transgender rights, supporters of the Idaho laws said they did not accept people identifying as anything but what was written on their birth certificates. They said the laws were aimed primarily at athletes who were identified as boys on their birth certificates but now identify as female and wish to compete as such.

‚ÄúBoys are boys and girls are girls,‚Äù State Senator Lee Heider said after the bills passed through the Senate two weeks ago. ‚ÄúNo doctor, no judge, no Department of Health and Welfare is going to change that reality.‚Äù

Representative Barbara Ehardt, the sponsor of the bill, said she began working on it 20 months ago in an effort to ‚Äúprotect opportunities for girls and women.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe physically cannot compete against biological boys, we just cannot, and once those opportunities are lost, they are gone, you cannot get those back,‚Äù Representative Ehardt, a former college basketball player and N.C.A.A. Division I women‚Äôs basketball coach, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis could literally tear teams and communities apart.‚Äù

Some major companies with large facilities in Idaho, including Chobani and Hewlett-Packard, called on the governor, who, like the bills‚Äô sponsors, is a Republican, to veto the bill.

The bills were signed on Monday, a day before the International Transgender Day of Visibility, and passed as Idaho recorded its largest single-day jump in coronavirus cases.

The new laws are expected to face lengthy and expensive legal challenges. In 2018, a federal court found unconstitutional a policy similar to Idaho‚Äôs new law barring changes on birth certificates. The state attorney general‚Äôs office expressed concern over the constitutionality of the restrictions on sports participation, writing that, among other things, the legislation could violate the federal law known as Title IX that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions receiving federal financing.

The Idaho legislation points to an emerging conflict over whether or how to regulate transgender athletes. The debate has become a wedge issue especially among conservatives trying to rally support for President Trump.

Those who want to limit the participation of transgender athletes have argued that transgender women have a competitive advantage because of their testosterone levels, though those levels can change in hormone treatment. Athletes like the Olympic marathon runner Paula Radcliffe and the tennis star Martina Navratilova have contended that athletes with higher natural levels of testosterone are able to outperform their competitors, especially in some track and field events and in weight lifting competitions. Navratilova later backed away from that view.

Caster Semenya, a two-time Olympic gold medal runner from South Africa, is the highest profile athlete to have faced a barrage of criticism, tests and, most recently, restrictions over her sex. She has identified as female since birth and has naturally occurring elevated levels of testosterone. Last July, she lost her challenge of a policy enacted by track and field‚Äôs governing body that barred her from some events unless she underwent hormone therapy.

But the science on the subject remains highly debated and inconclusive. A high natural testosterone level is not a one-step advantage in and of itself. Many have questioned why one physical trait ‚Äî testosterone level ‚Äî is thought to be an unfair advantage, when many of the world‚Äôs best athletes possess others ‚Äî Michael Phelps‚Äôs flipper-size feet, for example ‚Äî that propel them to unthinkable world records.

The Idaho High School Activities Association has a policy in place on the inclusion of transgender athletes that mirrors that of the N.C.A.A. and the International Olympic Committee. The N.C.A.A. recommends that schools require transgender athletes to complete one year of hormone treatment before competing on a female team. Similarly, the I.O.C. guidelines require transgender athletes competing on a female team to demonstrate testosterone levels below 10 nanomoles per liter for one year.

Idaho‚Äôs law, however, is a blanket ban on the participation of transgender girls in sports.

The law includes a provision that allows for anyone to file a claim questioning the sex of an athlete. The adjudication process could lead to sex testing that would allow for genital exams, genetic testing and hormone testing. ‚ÄúThey can have a DNA test to determine chromosomes, and those tests are as cheap as $50,‚Äù Representative Ehardt said. ‚ÄúAnd again, if there are questions beyond that, there are hormone, urine and blood tests that are much more common.‚Äù

Intersex athletes, individuals born with a range of sex characteristics, would also be subject to added scrutiny. ‚ÄúIf there was a situation such as that, that person‚Äôs doctor would no doubt already be familiar and already be in a position to solve and indicate if the DNA was not a female,‚Äù Representative Ehardt continued. She called such a hypothetical situation a ‚Äúrare, rare, rare case.‚Äù

Studies have suggested that 1.7 percent of the population has intersex traits.

There have been a record number of bills placing restrictions on transgender people nationwide since the beginning of the year. A bill similar to Idaho‚Äôs was introduced in Arizona, only to see a genital testing provision dropped before the bill was passed in the Arizona House in early March. The practice of gender verification testing has been banned by the International Olympic Committee since 1999.

Kathy Griesmyer, a policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs Idaho chapter, said the testing provision not only discriminated against transgender youth, but also opened the door for widespread abuse. ‚ÄúThere is now a law you can use to attack any successful female athlete,‚Äù she said, noting that exact guidelines of these processes are not yet clear. ‚ÄúAnd to think this is about helping girls, when we know it‚Äôs subjecting girls to an invasive examination of their bodies at a vulnerable time of their development.‚Äù

Lindsay Hecox, a first-year student at Boise State University and a former high school track and cross-country runner, said the bill further ‚Äúothers,‚Äù or marginalizes, transgender athletes like herself.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a simple college student who just wants to run and doesn‚Äôt want to have my rights taken away,‚Äù she said, adding that she is taking the year off from competitive running to focus on transitioning. ‚ÄúBeing trans shouldn‚Äôt make me a big news story, it shouldn‚Äôt make a spectacle. I‚Äôm just a normal person.‚Äù

A recent survey found that 12 percent of transgender girls and 14 percent of transgender boys play team sports compared with the national average of 68 percent of all youth. When states enact policies that create barriers for transgender athletes, the number of all L.G.B.T.Q. athletes in youth sports further declines.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to have any advantage,‚Äù Ms. Hecox said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAll I want to do is run, have a team, have friends on the team, and all try together. There‚Äôs no vindictiveness here of me trying to take away a girl‚Äôs scholarship or trophy or places.‚Äù",1585827508,fm7htj4

I remember as a freshman in high school my coach had me pacing our top varsity girl for the 800m in practice. My meet times were about where she wanted to be and it was my first track season. By the end of the season I ran a 2:13 and she was still around 2:20 which was pretty strong in women's from what I remember.

Many women are able to attend college that couldn't otherwise afford it because of atheltic scholarships; and when certain athletes with XY chromosomes are knocking them out of the competitions because of an inherent physiological advantage, it prevents those XX athletes from advancing in competition, effectively lowering their odds of being recognized and receiving a scholarship.

I'm married to a woman who owes a good deal of her college education to athletic scholarships. I'm grateful that she had the chance to get a degree.

She was ranking at state in her sport, both in highschool and at a collegiate level. However, her times wouldn't have even qualified for state, let alone ranked at state, if she was compared with the XY chromosome (we used to call them ""male"") competitors. There is no way that recruiters would have even noticed her at some random high school meet. Getting to state, and ranking there, was what got her noticed, and effectively what made it so she could afford to attend college.

Letting XY chromosome people compete in the women's class effectively guts Title IX athletics.

The snow-capped peaks of Idaho‚Äôs Wood River Valley are a magnet for movie stars and other wealthy tourists who throng to the area each winter bearing their skis, their appetites and their cash. They come for the soft powder, stay for the parties at top-class restaurants and pump money into an otherwise remote wilderness region where the howl of wolves echoes through the night.

But this year, somewhere between the lifts and the lodge, the tourists left behind something else: a deadly virus.

Now the valley is a coronavirus hot spot, registering one of the highest infection rates per capita in the country. With 192¬†cases in a county of just 22,000 people ‚Äî¬†including two deaths¬†‚Äî the share of the population testing positive is greater than even in New York City.

AD

The impact has been dramatic: The small hospital in Ketchum, the region‚Äôs hub, has partially shut down after four of its seven emergency doctors were quarantined. Patients are being ferried to facilities hours away. The fire department is relying on fresh-faced volunteers, trained in a day, to drive ambulances.

Everyone in town knows someone who has fallen ill.

The¬†coronavirus¬†‚Äútore through this valley like a wildfire,‚Äù said Brent Russell, one of the emergency room doctors.

Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.

‚ÄúI would say about a quarter of the people I know here have symptoms consistent with covid,‚Äù he added, referring to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Russell, 50, would normally be treating them. But he was one of the first in the region to come down with the virus. After an agonizing 3¬Ω weeks ‚Äî including nights when he woke up barely able to breathe ‚Äî Russell is only now returning to work to help cope with the ever-growing influx of new patients.

AD

Along with a handful of other ski hubs in the western United States, the Wood River Valley ‚Äî whose population density is about 3,000 times less than New York City‚Äôs ‚Äî offers a preview of what happens when the novel coronavirus escapes cities and attacks rural America.

Although scarcely populated areas offer some protection for a virus that thrives on social contact, they are¬†hardly immune. And once infection creeps in, the effect in rural communities could be more severe given threadbare health systems, long distances to hospitals and elderly populations.

‚ÄúThe epidemic hasn‚Äôt really hit many rural communities yet. But it will. And they know that if it does hit them, it‚Äôs going to hit them harder,‚Äù said Olugbenga Ajilore, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

AD

The vast majority of American coronavirus patients remain clustered in and around cities. That‚Äôs where the disease got its start in the United States, as infected travelers arrived from abroad.

But there are few areas ‚Äî even remote ones ‚Äî that remain untouched by the coronavirus as it continues¬†its relentless spread.

Montana and North Dakota recently recorded their first coronavirus deaths. In Washington state on Monday, Gov. Jay Inslee (D) noted a ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù pattern of rural counties that had recorded remarkably high positive test rates ‚Äî including one that was up to 21¬†percent. In rural Alabama, meanwhile, residents are bracing for bigger outbreaks of a virus that ‚Äúcould pop up anywhere,‚Äù said Rep.¬†Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.), who represents a wide, thinly populated region in the northern half of the state.

ÔøºMedical personnel stand by the quick-care entrance at St. Luke‚Äôs Magic Valley Medical Center last month in Twin Falls, Idaho. (Drew Nash/AP)

When it does, he said, he fears an impact that ‚Äúexposes the vulnerabilities in all of rural America,‚Äù including underfunded health systems and patchy broadband networks.

AD

For now, at least, the virus‚Äôs early forays into the countryside have come with a silver lining: They‚Äôre hitting areas that are better able to withstand them than most.

Some of the worst affected areas, per capita, are¬†recreation centers¬†renowned for their natural beauty that attract large numbers of tourists and have thrived during the past decade of economic growth. The counties surrounding Vail and Crested Butte in Colorado and Park City in Utah ‚Äî skiing meccas, all ‚Äî have seen especially high concentrations of patients.

So has¬†Blaine County, home to the Sun Valley ski resort, the city of Ketchum and Idaho‚Äôs largest coronavirus outbreak. Many celebrities have second homes in the region. The skiing is reputed to be some of the best in the country, and it‚Äôs a top destination on the conference circuit.

AD

But the same factors that have helped the region thrive have also made it vulnerable to the coronavirus.

‚ÄúWe were doing so well, with lots of tourism,‚Äù said Scott Mason, who owns three restaurants in Ketchum. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre getting so hard hit now.‚Äù

The area is particularly popular among tourists from Seattle, with direct flights to the small regional airport. Health experts say visitors from the area with the nation‚Äôs first coronavirus outbreak probably brought it to Idaho in the early days of the pandemic, before states and municipalities nationwide began to implement extreme restrictions intended to slow the spread.

Russell, the doctor, said he believes he contracted the virus before there were any confirmed cases in Idaho. An avid skier, he said innocuous-seeming conversations with visitors may have been the culprit.

AD

‚ÄúPeople think that skiing is a low-risk activity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre on a chairlift for two-thirds of the time, and you‚Äôre turning to face people to talk to them.‚Äù

Blaine County had its first two positive test results on March¬†14.

Sun Valley ‚Äî the region‚Äôs major ski resort ‚Äî¬†announced the next day¬†that it was closing for the season, weeks earlier than planned. The day after, Ketchum Mayor Neil Bradshaw did something he never thought he would: He wrote an open letter telling tourists to stay away.

‚ÄúFor a town used to welcoming visitors, that is hard to do,‚Äù he acknowledged in his piece for the¬†Idaho Mountain Express. ‚ÄúBut we must reduce the number of people visiting our area. .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. The message is clear: This is not a place for a virus vacation.‚Äù

AD

The city immediately began to clear out. Hotels emptied. Restaurants shuttered.

‚ÄúNormally, we‚Äôd be bustling,‚Äù Bradshaw said in an interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very much a ghost town right now.‚Äù

But it was too late. At Blaine County‚Äôs only hospital, the 25-bed St. Luke‚Äôs Wood River Medical Center, the virus had hit the staff hard. Two emergency doctors, Russell included, tested positive. Two others were believed to have been exposed and were in quarantine.

Without enough staff to keep the hospital running at full strength, administrators decided to transfer patients to other facilities and halt inpatient services.

Because nearby areas of Idaho are still relatively unaffected, it‚Äôs a strategy that‚Äôs working ‚Äî for now.

‚ÄúIf the rest of the state were as hard-hit as we are, we‚Äôd be in a real disaster here. It would be like Italy,‚Äù Russell said.

Even with those additional resources, the health system is under strain. Bill McLaughlin, the local fire chief, said about 10¬†percent of first responders have tested positive for the coronavirus. With patients being transported as far away as Boise ‚Äî a five- or six-hour round trip ‚Äî he has had to sign up and train volunteer ambulance drivers in as little as a day to keep the system running.

AD

All the while, there‚Äôs the personal toll.

In a city like Ketchum ‚Äî population 2,700 ‚Äî the impact of so many people falling ill at once has been deeply personal.

‚ÄúEverybody here knows somebody who has gotten sick, or in some cases, has passed away,‚Äù McLaughlin said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not six degrees of separation,‚Äù Bradshaw said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one degree.‚Äù

There‚Äôs also the impact on livelihoods. Tourists may have brought the coronavirus to the region. But without them, the local economy falls apart.

Mason, the restaurant owner, was cleaning the kitchen at the Ketchum Grill by himself one recent afternoon, with only the occasional to-go order to tend to. This time of year, his three restaurants would normally be packed. But with so little food to serve, he has gone from about 80¬†employees to 11.

‚ÄúThe numbers are drastic,‚Äù said Mason, who opened his first restaurant in the city 29¬†years ago. ‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre losing money. We‚Äôll do what we can, but this can‚Äôt go on for months and months.‚Äù

Authorities say they don‚Äôt know if the worst of the pandemic has passed or if it‚Äôs still to come. But they say they are heartened by the fact that the community appears to be rallying together. Social distancing rules are being followed. People are volunteering to help. The tourists, everyone seems convinced, will one day return.

And each night, at 8¬†p.m., the region puts its own spin on¬†a global phenomenon¬†of breaking the isolation and thanking health-care workers ‚Äî not with pots and pans or cheers or a song. But with a howl.

‚ÄúThe whole valley,‚Äù Russell said, ‚Äúlets out a giant wolf roar.‚Äù",1585851072,fm8kl0j

I absolutely support access to hormone blockers for trans teens (you can find me arguing such if go back far enough in my comments) because hormone blockers are essential, especially for trans girls, to ever have a chance of being passable as an adult.  Boys go through severe changes during puberty like voice changes, growth, brow changes, and overall size that will make it very hard for them to ever appear female.  You can usually easily tell trans females who had access to hormone blockers because you would never know they were trans until they tell you whereas most ofnthe ones without are either never passable or have to go through a lot of surgery.  Girls obviously grow breasts which will require later surgery.  But let the kid take hormone blockers and they put off puberty and dont go through these changes.   If for some reason they change their mind later they merely go off the blockers and have a late puberty.

Its about men wanting to be girls. You never see a female to male represented. You never see a lesbian included in a gay parade. You never see a drag king.

She disinfected her hotel room and stayed away from other  guests, but worried about the coughing person in the room next door. So  she donned her own fitted N95 mask that she uses for work. 

""I wanted to protect myself,"" she said. ""I wanted to protect my patients.""

That first day at work, Buckalew said, she was told to take off her mask.

When  she asked hospital administrators why, the reasons kept changing.  First, Buckalew said she was told it was against hospital policy for  health care workers to bring their own gear. Then, she said,  administrators told her if she wore her own N95 mask, others would want  to wear the masks as well and the hospital didn't have enough. Finally,  Buckalew said, it was that CDC guidelines don't require the mask at all  times. 

""I said if I can't wear it, then we have a problem,"" she said.

Refusing  to take off her mask, she said, got her terminated. Then, she said,  after complaining she was reinstated and then terminated again ‚Äî all  within three days.

""I'm raising a huge big stink because it's  wrong. It's unsafe. We'll never flatten the curve if hospital systems  keep acting this way,"" she said, adding that she's speaking now because  she's already lost her assignment and wanted to speak on behalf of those  who can't. ""A lot of people can't speak out because they're afraid, or  they know that they'll be fired.""[source](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/825200206/doctors-say-hospitals-are-stopping-them-from-wearing-masks)

9325,dylanlwls,"No, no, it is. COVID-19 is Coronavirus.


The official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus is Covid-19, while the scientific name for the virus that causes the disease is SARS-CoV-2. 

The current pandemic is caused by a new strain from the coronavirus family, which infect birds and mammals. Prior to this new virus we knew of six coronaviruses that affect humans, all of which cause respiratory tract infections: four which cause common colds, and two which cause MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, respectively. 

Strictly then the term 'coronavirus' could be referring to any of the entire family of coronaviruses, although right now it's being used in most mainstream media to refer simply to the current pandemic.


On 11 February the World Health Organization(WHO) announced that the name for the disease would be COVID-19, with CO referring to corona, VI to Virus, D to disease and 19 to 2019, when the first case was identified, near the end of the year in Wuhan, China.

Where WHO refer to the virus itself they call it the Covid-19 virus. Prior to announcing the new name WHO had been calling it 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

'Covid-19 virus' is not, however, the scientific name for the virus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses the body who decide what viruses are called have named it Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"", or SARS-CoV-2. Their reason for the name is because the virus is genetically related to the one that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003.",1585939040,fmc51m2

Volleyball absolutely being taller and bigger is an advantage as you'll be able to block and spike better.  Not to mention trans girls will jump higher which helps with blocking a and spiking. 

Basketball is obviously biased toward height, size, and jumping. 

Track and Field is very biased to strength, stride length, and size.

Being stronger helps you hit the ball harder in softball as well as pitch faster, run faster, and throw farther.  

Trans girls will have huge advantages over other girls in every high school sport except gymnastics where being short allows you to tumble faster.

9391,wholesomefolsom96,"Actually both parties agree they can‚Äôt claim that group was patient zero or the sole fault of the spread. And that the party wasn‚Äôt necessarily at fault. That the given nature of skiing allows the virus to spread and that blame lies on officials for not shutting it down sooner. 

‚ÄúWe believe that the virus came in from Seattle, probably a couple of weeks earlier. They probably got the virus from many people here, and for that I feel terrible.‚Äù - Neil Bradshaw, the mayor of Ketchum

The full excerpt:

Brent Russell, one of two E.R. physicians at St. Luke‚Äôs in Ketchum who tested positive, battled a hundred-and-four-degree fever with shaking chills....

What bothered Russell the most over the past two weeks, however, was how quickly some members of his community turned to find someone to blame. Local finger-pointing began with a March 20th article, in the Idaho Mountain Express, which alleged that a National Brotherhood of Skiers apr√®s-ski dance party at Sun Valley‚Äôs River Run Lodge on March 6th, a few hours before DJ Jazzy Jeff took the stage uptown, could have been the source of the outbreak. 
....

A week after the story was published, the mayors of Ketchum and Sun Valley signed a joint letter condemning the allegations as ‚Äúbaseless and unmerited.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to point the finger at anyone, point it at me, for not closing this town down earlier,‚Äù Neil Bradshaw, the mayor of Ketchum, said. ‚ÄúWe believe that the virus came in from Seattle, probably a couple of weeks earlier. They probably got the virus from many people here, and for that I feel terrible.‚Äù

....

Then the article goes on to explain that not the party, but the nature of a ski resort helped the virus spread more easily.",1585962664,fmd9x2v

Under the ""strict scrutiny"" test, the government has the power to restrict right in cases of compelling government interest. One of the established compelling reasons is to preserve lives of large numbers of people. To pass muster, the law also be narrowly tailored to the purpose, and use the least restrictive means.

If it winds up in court, they will lose if they fail to show it was narrowly tailored and least restrictive, not because they don't have the power at all.

States can pull from the same authority or have enacted laws to do the same. The federal government can impose isolation and quarantine on states but haven't. Allot of this was sorted out the last time we had a pandemic.

If things get really bad, which I genuinely hope they do not, martial law is another option. Court cases will take years to resolve but it would be difficult to get a federal court to agree that isolation/quarantine was an infringement of your rights.

For example, during WWII the federal government interred American citizens of Japanese discent. The supreme court took up a case by an American citizen who was charged with avoiding internment. They ruled that it was the prerogative of the president to act in whatever capacity they deem necessary for the protection of the country as a whole, even if it conflicts with the rights of the individual.

Are people taking social distancing seriously, or do people still think it's a hoax? are people hoarding or are people sharing resources and looking out for each other? Are measures being taken at stores, and are non essential businesses still open? I know it's going to be a mixed bag in terms of reaction to the pandemic, but I'm just curious to see how the states actually been doing since I have seen some rather ridiculous headlines come from government officials out of the pan handle.

9625,melodicjello,"All this says is how many tests can back positive.  It doesn‚Äôt say anything about how many people were given access to tests and why access was given. It doesn‚Äôt say anything about how many people had symptoms and wanted to get testing but couldn‚Äôt. Doesn‚Äôt say anything about all the people who have already had it and had no idea or got tested after they had already recovered. I hate these numbers. Death is the only number that matters right until the antibody test rolls out. Then we‚Äôll find out 40% of the population already had it and the effective death rate was .2%.   Thats if you blame corona virus for dying from obesity.  Obesity is a disease which CV only speeds up. No one wants to talk about it but that‚Äôs the reality.  (for the overwhelming majority of people): You aren‚Äôt born with heart disease you eat your way to heart disease. You aren‚Äôt born with high blood pressure. Your choices cause high blood pressure. You aren‚Äôt born with kidney disease you drink your way to kidney disease. So if you die from Covid because you had underlying conditions, it‚Äôs the condition that killed you.  So please stop smoking stop drinking to excess stop eating packaged foods and get some exercise.  That‚Äôs why everyone is Louisiana is dying.",1586200594,fmm87ib

Neither Idaho nor federal law requires proof of direct contact with those infected to enforce a quarantine. That would be silly, especially when you can't detect that someone has been infected for up to two weeks after it occurs

As far as I can tell by looking at the laws in place, they can absolutely do this. Whether that is a good thing or not is another discussion altogether",1586202562,fmmc0l6
