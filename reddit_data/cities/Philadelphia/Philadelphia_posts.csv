1,NiceShoesWF,1577779814,ei0208,Nan,"Hello Philadelphians, I moved to your great city part time 16 months ago. I had a NY registered car for the first few months that I lived here. During that time I received a ticket for expired NY inspection. 2 weeks after receiving the ticket, I gifted the car to a friend back in NY as I didn’t have a need for it here. They registered it and received new plates in NY and have been happily using it. I no longer have the ticket number and do not see an option on any PPA page to find tickets by my old NY license plate number. 

From what I understand these tickets follow your vehicle registration, which no longer exists along with my NY license plate number. My concern is I have decided to stay in Philadelphia permanently and would like to get a PA drivers license. I’m wondering if I go to the PA DMV to transfer my NY license to PA will they ask me to pay the outstanding ticket in order to get a PA license. 

I’m not trying to dodge on what I owe. I would just like to find out what I owe and have it ready before DMV tells me I owe $xxx and need to pay it before being able to transfer my drivers license. Is this a valid concern? I will not be registering any vehicles in PA, just a license transfer from NY to PA. Any information on how to find outstanding PPA tickets with just an old NY license plate number or experience with this kind of situation. I appreciate your time for reading this and any insight you may offer would be a tremendous help. Thank you.",philadelphia,Year old PPA ticket for expired NY inspection.

So much so that in my quest to save for a house, I even considered maybe one day, instead of Croydon, settling down right here.  It's just so convenient to what I do, and with everything in Port Richmond on one side and everything in Mayfair/bustleton area (Not totally familiar with it yet), it really is seemingly the perfect place at first glance.  However, I do see the problems.  The biggest concern so far being the shady packs of teenage kids aimlessly walking around looking like they're looking for unlocked cars.  In the summer I'm sure it will be more apparent.  However there seems to be a lot of folks who care about the area and it doesn't look like it's going to turn into Frankford in the near future.  Though everyone I talked to who said they wanna move out is concerning, It seems like a lot of immigrants from China, Russia, and the middle east seem to be moving in, and I don't see a problem with these types of folks.  

I'd really like to get some opinions on if NE Philly will remain stable as it is now.  The gentrified parts of the city are just plain expensive, hipsteresque, and unappealing to me.

The factors of the low cost of housing seem like things that may not affect my situation making it a good option for me. Let me know if I’m missing something.

One reason of the low costs being the parking/commute being terrible. For work, I either travel out of town Monday-Friday or I work from home. So it’s not like I am commuting to and from Manayunk everyday. My girlfriend lives in the Northeast around Torresdale and takes the train to center city every day. A train from Manayunk is an upgrade compared to her current commute.

There also isn’t any good public school options leading to it being a cheaper option. We will be in this home for about 5-7 years before we have school aged children. At that point, we plan on moving somewhere with better schools. So in the time we live there, schools won’t be a factor either.

The city income tax is also much higher than in Conshohocken, but property taxes are so much lower to the point where it is really a wash.

Now to why we’re interested in living there is because it’s a safe area with things to do and has an easy ride to get into the city on weekends. So because these negatives don’t have much affect on our situation, it seems like Manayunk is a perfect fit for us to take advantage of cheaper housing. Is there anything I’m missing or anything that can be added?",philadelphia,Buying a house in Manayunk area

140,magicmurph,1578006041,ej5xd5,Nan,"Hello /r/Philly, I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season.

During the thick of the festivities, an accusation was made against a moderator attending one of our weekly meetups. Upon confronting them about it, other accusations were made. By the end of the week, accusations were flying in dozens of directions, and so thick we could make little sense of them.

As a result of all this, the accused moderator in question has stepped down, has left reddit altogether, and will no longer be attending the weekly meetup.

Something we would like our userbase to take to heart in the wake of this event, is that myself and my team are volunteer moderators on an online message board. We filter spam, we dont investigate assault. If something serious happens to you, go to the police. Comfort and well-being of our userbase is a top priority at meetups, but we are just regular people, not enforcers. Based on past experiences with users being threatened of one thing or another, we are reticent to take rash action. However, subreddit drama and user/mod statuses don't matter. Your safety does. Be safe.

We host these meetups with the goal of connecting users with others in a safe and comfortable environment, to have a drink or three. They have been a roaring success over the past near-decade, and we'd like for them to continue to be so. So with that in mind, treat others with respect, and have a happy new year.

EDIT: 

Many of you are asking about the timetable. The very first I heard of any inappropriate action by this moderator from any user was a private message two weeks ago. I was told he bit a user on the shoulder. The moderator told me he had apologized and all was well, and denied the repercussive threats. I didn't plan on much more than having a sit down with him and ensuring he understand boundaries and personal space, but he didn't make it that week's meetup. I did hear from a few other members about some overly friendly behavior.

A week ago, I received a message from the same user as the first, but much more serious this time. Following this, I began to receive messages from many different users, saying many different things. Some were in defense of the mod, calling all the accusations lies. Others were accusations against the original accuser, accusing him of fairly heinous behavior with other users. Some were full of sub drama, hinting at some plot to get the mod removed so they could take his role. Some really petty stuff. One claimed there was a romance triangle at play.

All told, in the interim between a week ago and this morning I received eleven different user message chains, making the truth quite impossible to determine. At this point I had invited the moderator to make his own statement, and was planning on letting the police sort out anything serious. This morning, the mod stood down, and so here we are.

The other moderators of this community were not aware of anything untoward going on, as the mod in question was the one regularly attending the weekly meetups. I believe our moderator team acted exactly as they should given the information they had. It is not for message board custodians to police tangentially related social gatherings. Everyone at these meetups are adults, and are responsible enough to know what is and isn't OK and to report anything not OK to the actual authorities.",philadelphia,On subreddits and safety

I am going to go to the Rocky steps lol cause my parents who live there and their friends have never been and want to go. 

Outside of that 

I really enjoy craft/small batch/artisanal/insert your own pretentious word - beer, coffee, food, drinks. I know about La Colombe but I am assuming there’s probably much better cafes/roasters in your fair city. Who are the best breweries? I personally really enjoy sours and Hazy IPAs - I enjoy most except porters/stouts though. Food wise - I really am not picky at all and will try pretty much anything but knowing my parents they will probably already have dinner plans picked out at one of the same 4 restaurants they go to every week lol so more so lunch/breakfast options. 

Lastly - are there any outdoor or cool things I should go visit? I understand it’ll be cold but I’m cool with that if there’s something cool. Botanic gardens, zoo, museums, bookstores, art, farmer market, etc.

My roommates and I have been looking at this beautiful house in South Philly that we want to rent starting in February but are having trouble getting in contact with the property management company.

The house has been vacant (according to Zillow) for over 100 days before we showed any interest so I'm confused why they aren't making any effort to get back to us. I understand people take off work for the holidays but that time has long passed.

I reached out to my property management company, who thanked me for informing them as they were unaware of the renovations in the commercial space and would be talking with management to resolve, and thanked me again for making them aware. So basically they're going to send them an email and ask them to stop, which the company probably ignore.

We used to live in North Philly when we moved here and afterwards moved from trash-filled back streets to an neighbourhood where streets are clean, despite a lack of any taxpayer funded cleaners. The truth that nobody seems to own up to is that certain neighbourhoods look like garbage because the people that live there simply don't care and they think that it's ok to leave trash all over the backstreets. Someone in power would do well to say as much.

Two and a half years ago, there was an issue with the pipes for the bathtub leaking water into the wall, and even sprang a leak in the ceiling below. My landlord fixed this, and while the pipes are not leaking anymore (or not enough to notice), this left water damage under our bathtub. When you walk over the floor around the bathtub, it does not feel stable. I was recently in the apartment below us and their ceilings look like [this](https://imgur.com/a/ANRpDOQ). Even the tenant in this apartment expressed concern about the state of their ceilings. Our landlord stopped by the apartment below me yesterday, not mine, and told me everything is structurally fine. I messaged them saying that testing structural integrity does not end at visual inspection and haven't gotten a response yet.

So I want to get your opinion: does this seem concerning or does this seem ""normal"" (normal being a general anticipated amount of wear in an apartment or home)? The current state of things makes me feel like the bathtub will eventually fall through the ceiling, but I don't know enough about this situation to know if this is a realistic anticipation.

Last year I took a job as an Account Manager for a video production company. A few months into the job, payments were late or not showing up at all. My employer claimed that when one of our larger accounts paid, he would rectify the backpay, but that never happened. In May, he gave us an ultimatum- 1- stay and restructure backpay/commission structure or 2- quit and accept a payment plan. Clearly I left. The employer never made payment on time and claimed if we filed suit against him he would claim bankruptcy and we'd never see our money. He would pay us randomly, but it barely put a dent in the total sum owed. While this was going on we learned the despite him paying us the taxed amount, he never properly paid taxes.

However, I am trying to find an apartment that is affordable and does not have a long commute into Philly in case I end up accepting a job offer.

I've been working in Center City for a year and a half commuting in from NJ.  My girlfriend and I are looking to move closer so I have been checking out areas where we both could have a reasonable commute of like 35-40 minutes.  She works in Jamison.

The Elkins Park/Jenkintown/Glenside area looks pretty nice and safe and looks like that drive for her wouldn't be too bad, and I'd be able to grab the train into the city easily.  We have also looked at the Warminster area, but from looking at SEPTA time tables it looks like that commute is still probably gonna come to about an hour for me depending on how close we are to the station.  

Can anyone recommend any other suburbs where we could both have a decent commute?  Our budget for rent and utilities is around $1500 but obviously the cheaper the better within reason.  The only other stipulation would be that we would like to not be within city limits so she doesn't have to pay the wage tax.  

Obviously we might not be able to workout a situation where we both have equal commutes, I'm just really trying to avoid having something long considering mine has been at least an hour and a half for some time.

However, I am very interested in the types of Philadelphia residents that frequent this sub. Maybe it is just me, but I have a suspicion that the main users of this sub are upper-middle-class to upper class, professional/managerial workers, a large amount of non-native residents, probably a large selection of college students, etc.

Why do I think this? Mainly because the majority of posts feature downtown images or locations, with almost nobody exploring neighborhoods of the West, North, Northeast, or Southwest. I barely even see many posts about Germantown or Manayunk! Additionally, many of the posts about bars and restaurants feature places that are probably largely unaffordable for poorer, working-class residents of the city. Finally, I have a feeling that many people here do not empathize with the struggles of poor minorities of our city. This is exemplified in posts discussing crime or criminal cases, and further lends to my belief that this sub is populated by the demographics I described. 

So, if you find this interesting, please feel free to comment with things like:
-  Your profession 
- Native or non-native resident (suburbs don't count)
- Salary/Wage 
- Age
- Studying or not
- And if comfortable, gender and race/ethnicity

Just had this crazy idea: would it be possible to turn this theatre into a live music venue? Would it work? Do you think it would help the neighborhood?

I'm literally just starting a conversation about this as I live down the street and therefore, am lucky enough to be able to admire the building's outer charm on a regular basis (seriously... Look at the links below. It's a very beautiful building). It's just a shame that as the last surviving theatre on this part of 52nd street, it's not used for very much.

But yeah... What would YOU like to see happen with the space? Yes it has a tenant, but it's still not used very much.

Colonial Playhouse  
522 W. Magnolia Ave.  
Aldan, PA 19018 

Performance dates:  
May 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16  
Fridays &amp; Saturdays: 8 pm  
Sunday Matinees: 2 pm

Rehearsals will be in Ardmore, PA.

&amp;#x200B;

About the play:  
Two cops. Three crooks. Eight doors. Go! In a cheap motel room, an embezzling mayor is supposed to meet with his female accountant, while in the room next door, two undercover cops wait to catch the meeting on videotape. But there's some confusion as to who's in which room, who's being videotaped, who's taken the money, who's hired a hit man, and why the accountant keeps taking off her clothes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The audition will consist of cold readings from the script. Please contact director Sam Barrett with any questions at [colonialplayhousetheater@yahoo.com](mailto:colonialplayhousetheater@yahoo.com). Please note this is a physical show in which 4 characters are in some state of undress and 3 characters kiss, among other physical comedy bits.  


Character Descriptions:  
Eric Sheridan: Male, 30s-40s. A bookish, even-keeled police officer who’s thrown into some difficult situations — while not wearing any pants.

Billie Dwyer: Female, 20s-30s. A police officer. Eric’s partner. Although she seems to lack every skill needed for police work, she is enthusiastic and eager to succeed.

Karen Brown: Female, 30s-40s. An accountant who usually has a very professional demeanor, but seems unable to keep herself in control today.  
NOTE: the actress cast would likely be on stage in her underwear and/or a slip.

Mayor Meekly: Male, 50s-70s. A sweet, gentle fellow, who seems very Innocent (with a capital I)

Agent Frank: Male, 20s-50s. Town Hall head of Security. Although he can seem confident and even gruff, in moments of crisis he is easily reduced to a very frightened man.

Todd: Male, 20s-50s. Speaks with a pronounced Scottish accent. A professional hit man who’s accent gets thicker the angrier he gets, until he’s completely indecipherable.

Mary Meekly: Female, 50s-70s. The Mayor’s wife. Small-statured, she seems very sweet-natured, and a good match for her husband the mayor.

634,BallDeSac,1578887789,enysue,Nan,"All my life, The Tastykake Peanut Butter Kandy Kake was my go-to snack. As a child, my parents always kept them in the freezer. We would eat them directly out of the freezer without allowing them to thaw. I grew up eating frozen Kandy Kakes and thought they were the bomb. Whenever I went to a friends house, they were in a freezer as well. When I went to college and got them as a part of a care package, I immediately put them in the freezer. As an adult living on my own, I moved up to north jersey, but they still had Tastykake products in ShopRite up there, I would buy them and put them in the freezer. I then went on a strict financial diet and stopped buying so much junk, including junk foods. But, co-workers would buy them at work and leave them in the freezer. They would announce “Went out and got some Taskykakes on sale, they’re in the break room”. Of course, they weren’t just “in” the break room, they were in the break room freezer. 

Recently I moved back to the Philly area, and moved in with the new girlfriend. I got the ShopRite circular last week and saw that Tastykake products were on sale, and had a coupon to go with it. I’ve been itching for some Kandy Kakes so I went out and got a box of them with the recent grocery run. My sweet girlfriend decided to unpack all the groceries I returned with. Later that night, she asked if I wanted anything for desert. Of course I was in the mood for a Kandy Kake! So she goes to the kitchen and comes back with the Kakes unpacked, and sitting neatly on a small plate with a dollop of Cool Whip (she’s a sweetheart and loves to serve). I reach for the first Kake and notice it doesn’t feel cool to the touch. I pop it into my mouth, and...

HO-LY-CRAP!

Kandy Kakes taste SO MUCH better at room temperature. I feel like I have been cheated this whole time, thinking Kandy Kakes had to be eaten frozen. For 30 years I feel like I have been living a lie. Luckily, the girlfriend was able to share the joy of room temperature Kandy Kakes with me, because apparently she never even heard of putting Kandy Kakes in the freezer - she grew up in South Jersey, mind you. And so did I. I’m still trying to process all of this, and it’s been 2 days. Needless to say, I just finished the box of Kandy Kakes after only having them in the house for ~48 hours, and I’m the only one who eats them. 

For anyone that eats frozen Kandy Kakes, please take them out of the freezer. You will thank me for it later. 

I had to share this experience with you all. I didn’t know where it would be appropriate to share this, as I don’t usually post on reddit, but I figured anything Philadelphia related would work. And please, for the love of God, stop freezing Kandy Kakes!

That in and of itself was, whatever, annoying but, like, I could live with it and accept I wasn't fighting the tolls for this.

So I go to the websight it tells me to go to, and put in my violation number, doesn't work, no record found. I try again, same thing. So I thought ""Ok maybe this is old and I all ready paid it, cool""

Fast forward to last week, I get a message saying my fine went into collections. Wtf.

So I call today to deal with it, and this is a short break down of what happens.

They ask for my invoice number, which I don't have because I got that letter like two months ago (invoice from the CA doesn't have it) They look it up in the system though my license plate, in two different areas, and say I have no violation. I ask them to double check and they said I have nothing, call the collection agency and they should have your invoice number, and call back.

So fine, I call the collection agency (Professional Account Management for anyone who might ever deal with them) and I was on hold for AT LEAST 22 minuets.

When they did answer and I explained the situation, they are like ""Yeah you owe this"" and I am like ""Well they say I don't and the web sight doesn't have the violation code""

She said ""Put the code in with out the last two numbers and it will work""Guess what, IT WORKED.

How in the hell was I supposed to know to do that. If you give me a full code, I expect to use a full damn code. And there are no spaces or dashes or anything else, its just R123456789. Why would I suddenly just start taking stuff out of the code and hoping it worked?!?!? That is stupid!! And why couldn't EZ pass find my fine. They sure as hell found it to send it to collections.

This whole thing is dumb but I figured I would tell others about it in case you ever have to deal with the same thing, apparently, the last two digits of your code might not matter, and EZ pass might not be able to find you owe them money.",philadelphia,"EZ pass is stupid, so some advice for you all."

I'm going to be moving to Frankford soon, right around Overington Park and would love some more info on the area.

The area I'll be in is just a couple blocks west of the el, and seems pretty much like any normal working class family community.

The only reason I am really looking for details about the neighborhood is because after spending time (day and night) walking around a bit in Frankford, (which seems like most neighborhoods I've lived in) I read a whole bunch of horrible experiences on some other forums and reddit threads from those claiming to live in the neighborhood. It certainly didn't feel like Stanton, (don't really like weaving in and out of drug deals on the way to the store.)

I'm wondering what everyone's thoughts are about Frankford as a whole. Personally, I mind my own business, but would definitely like to get to know and socialize with my neighbors. Want some clarification because the opinions online definitely don't match my first impressions.

&amp;#x200B;

First, there are personal things: You as a citizen can make an impact on a personal level. Don't take a Wawa bag if you can help it -- and most of the time, be honest Philly-- you don't need a Wawa bag. Bring reusable bottles instead of buying bottled water or bottled soda if you can. You know the drill on this one. You can take fewer napkins, use rags instead of paper napkins, etc. All good steps, and these have been outlined clearly for a long time, but the people that are doing this are not typically the problem, it's the people that either a) don't know to do this, or b) stubbornly choose not to follow this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I think we should really bring this up in city government. I don't know how to get involved, but I definitely want this issue discussed. At the city level, I think we need to start putting our trash in corner-spots and reducing the number of trips that the trash sweepers take (each one has costs, that we pay in taxes: more efficient trash collection. I know there is a lot going on in politics right now, but this issue affects us daily and personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a beautiful city. I moved here from the other coast to be in this town, and I want to be here for a long time. I know the people in this city are competent - it might take a little budging, a little negotiation, and a little stress, but this is a solvable issue.

874,mattgk39,1579292708,eq5wn8,Nan,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/dx9fhh/help\_fighting\_a\_traffic\_ticket/](https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/dx9fhh/help_fighting_a_traffic_ticket/)

Long story short, I stopped to pick someone up in the bike lane, got a ticket from a cop.  Got the ticket dismissed in traffic court.  I got a lot of flak on the original post, but I still firmly believe I'm in the right.  

I was cited under Section 3351 of Title 75 which reads:

***(a)  General rule.--****Outside a business or residence district, no person shall stop, park or stand any vehicle, whether attended or unattended, upon the roadway when it is practicable to stop, park or stand the vehicle off the roadway. In the event it is necessary to stop, park or stand the vehicle on the roadway or any part of the roadway, an unobstructed width of the highway opposite the vehicle shall be left for the free passage of other vehicles and the vehicle shall be visible from a distance of 500 feet in each direction upon the highway.*

***(b)  Exception for disabled vehicles.--****This section and sections 3353 (relating to prohibitions in specified places) and 3354 (relating to additional parking regulations) do not apply to the driver of any vehicle which is disabled in such a manner and to such an extent that it is impossible to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving the vehicle in that position*

My defense was that the bike lane is part of the ""roadway"" because Section 102 of Title 75 defines **Roadway** as:

*That portion of a highway improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the sidewalk, berm or shoulder even though such sidewalk, berm or shoulder is used by pedalcycles. In the event a highway includes two or more separate roadways the term ""roadway"" refers to each roadway separately but not to all such roadways collectively.*

The bike lane is specifically excluded from the roadway in the definition where it say*s ""*used for vehicular travel"" and ""exclusive of....even though such...shoulder is used by pedalcycles"" (pedlacycles are bikes).  Furthermore the signs read ""no parking"", and I was stopped and not parked.  There are plenty of bike lanes in philly which are no stopping zones.  If Section 3351 were to apply to bike lanes, then all bike lanes would be no stopping zones.  

The judge at first disagreed that the bike lane is not part of the roadway.  We went back and forth on the definition of roadway and I also pointed out that the spirit of Section 3351 is so that people don't just stop in the middle of the street and block traffic.  I also pointed out that even if the bike lane was part of the roadway I was pulled over to the side in accordance with the part of the law that reads ""In the event it is necessary to stop, park or stand the vehicle on the roadway....an unobstructed width....shall be left for the free passage of other vehicles"". 

In the end she dismissed the ticket somewhat begrudgingly because if it was valid it could ""encourage other drivers to drive in the bike lane"" since if the bike lane is included as part of the roadway then it can be used to ""vehicular travel"". Admittedly,  I should have thought of this.  Either the bike lane is part of the roadway and therefore I can drive my car in it, or it's not part of the roadway and I can't.  But if it's not part of the roadway then Section 3351 does not apply to it.  

&amp;#x200B;

NOTES ABOUT TRAFFIC COURT:

Dress as nicely as you can, show respect, and act like an adult for fuck's sake.  There were so many people there that looked like they just rolled out of bed with their pants sagging sayin shit like ""yo"" and ""arrrd"" and ""yeaa bruh"".  Wear a suit if you have one.  It's always yes/no sir/ma'm and always address the judge as ""Your Honor"" (i.e yes/no Your Honor, this is what happened Your Honor, Your Honor I disagree because, etc..).  If you show up looking like shit and talking like your shootin the shit with your friends, nobody will take you seriously.  I wore my best perfectly tailored suit and I'm sure it went a long way in having the judge actually listen to and consider my argument.  Also, be prepared.  If you think you were wrongly ticketed, read the law and point out where the law says you are right, or where it shows the ticket is invalid.  

Finally, I wasn't in a ""real courtroom"".  It was a hearing room, which was basically a small room with the judge sitting at a computer (no robes, which I found odd) and a small table in front of the computer desk where you and someone from the DA's office sits (usually a paralegal it seems like).  Before the hearing we all sat in pews in the bigger room which all the hearing rooms were part of, and the paralegals called everyone up one by one and offered a plea deal (I wasn't offered one since my ticket didn't carry any points).  So if your ticket carries points, GO TO COURT.  They will most likely offer you a plea deal where you just pay the fine and don't get any points on your license.",philadelphia,UPDATE: I beat my ticket for stopping in a bike lane on Spruce in traffic court.

There were signed photos of some celebs who had eaten there put on the walls.

I'm interested in moving to Philly, I'm already a native of PA but I'm more from an NYC/NJ area. Im from Jersey originally if that helps. 

I want to move to Philadelphia as I cannot move to New York City. I'm moving to Philly for acting opportunities, of which there are far more there then where I am currently but less than NYC. Of course, I cannot make it to NYC yet so I'm trying to climb the ladder as much as I can. I've only been to Philly once in my life, for barely a weekend. My friends and I stayed in an Airbnb in Kensington. We later learned that was the wrong part of Philly from a friend that lives down there and was going to meet us. Either way, I had a blast and my particular neighbourhood in Kensington wasn't all that bad. 

That being said, in terms of acting opportunities (student films from Temple, maybe Drexel, theatres across the city, performances, entertainment venues, and clubs around the city), where would be a good place to start to look to live from? I will more than likely have my car with me so travel isn't a huge worry but I would like more information. I'm looking to find a job before I move. My decision is currently moving at the end of May or renewing my lease for one last year and moving at the end of next May. 

I've tried to look online but I feel my situation is rather unique and for actors, there isn't any on Google or Reddit. Not even the r/acting subreddit. So it's time to go to the source: rent, jobs, acting opportunities, crime, the whole nine yards. What can I expect in Philadelphia if I intent to move there?

Thanks.",philadelphia,Interested in Moving to Philly

Join the r/Philadelphia and r/PhillyMeetups community as we celebrate the holiday season the best way we know how... a little bit late, over several drinks, with a twist. Celebrate whatever holiday you want! Christmas! Halloween! Diwali! Cinco De Mayo! You name it, we will celebrate with you on leap day!

**There will be a White Elephant with a $20 limit around 8 pm for anyone that brings a wrapped gift.** All gifts will be put into a pile and all participants will receive a random number. Starting with person number one, you can either take a wrapped gift or take a gift someone else has opened. If someone takes your gift, it then becomes your turn to take a gift that has not been stolen this round or grab an unopened gift. When an unopened gift is grabbed, the next participant in numerical order starts a new round.

St Stephen’s Green has a television that we can use for video games if anyone is willing to bring a system. This event will be situated in the basement with a private bartender. Street parking is free, but it might not be abundant; there are a couple of reasonably priced garages near the location - 16th/Mt Vernon and 17th/Green, both of which are one block away.

St Stephen’s Green is also a short walk away from the Spring Garden stop on the Broad St Line, and the 43 can pick you up from the Market-Frankford line and drop you off two blocks away.

**NEWCOMERS ARE WELCOMED! This is a great opportunity to meet new people.**

It looked very thin and seemed to be searching for food. When we put the window down, the dog seemed timid and scared of people.

I called ACCT Philly and they said they would send a dispatcher out.

I'm looking to purchase a home in the 200k range, which I will be using only a couple of months per year and will be empty outside of that. I've looked online and see a couple of neighborhoods which seem descent. 

1- Port Richard: 

Seems to be a descent safe-ish are. The whole bus to Girard thing seems to be a bit of a bummer but mostly I'm concerned about spillover from K&amp;A. Is that contained or is it growing geographically. I see 

2- Lower Moyamensing:

Seems to be a normal neighborhood, good connections, but heard some things about the area between 5th and 9th. Is it that bad? 

3- A couple of homes in East Kensington at Jasper and Huntington 

Seems to have the greatest potential upside out of the three because of the EL there but being near some notes heroin centers is concerning. Also seems somewhat desolate still on Google Maps though clear signs of improvement and construction activity.

Most important for me would be safety, access to Center City and University City with also some potential for price gain (nut a must but a plus). I know I should scout the neighborhoods and all, and I will when I come to Philly for a couple of months very soon but was looking for some feed back on how these neighborhoods are etc.

I just moved to Philly in September via Chicago and am living in West Philly.

 We have an individual natural gas heater for our unit that has stopped working for the past week. I've been in contact with the landlord many times and have gotten mostly vague responses about ordering a part and getting me an ETA when it will come in (no eta yet). I looked into a little bit of tenant law in Philly and saw that landlords are responsible for keeping the apartment at 68th as long as there's radiator heat (which we have even though it's controlled by a thermostat). I'm about to call him and request prorated rent for the days that the apartment is blowed at 68 degrees. And I'm not just being a wimp haha. It's below 60 degrees in our apartment all the time. 

does anybody have any advice for me on how to come out on top in this situation? Do I have any legal recourse that won't ruin my relationship with my landlord? Can I withhold rent regardless of what they say to my request for prorated rent? Should I call the city? Any other experience or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've lived in major cities, tourist destinations, mid size cities, quiet burbs, and deep in the woods. I moved to Philly 2 years ago this week.

Out of everywhere I've lived, Philly is my fave. I love everything the city has to offer - amazing food, great art, huge expanses of green space, great bars, amazing people. I love that for the first time I can afford a house (sure Im renting, and sure it's in a neighborhood that's in transition, but I even love that). I love that there are interesting things happening every day. I love that I can get around without a car. I love the weather.

My dad moved here part time about 20 years ago, so I had been visiting for years, but all we ever did when I came was touristy stuff. Now that I've been here 2 years I've had the chance to explore on my own, find my own favorite spots, meet amazing people.

Yes he was born here but he didn't play or live here. It's like when folk in Liverpool worship the Beatles and don't talk about how the first thing they did when they got some money was leave town.

From the wikipedia article (not always the best source) ""he was honored around the league with video tributes and fan ovations,[\[287\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant#cite_note-cacciola_12162015-292) including arenas that historically jeered him such as [Wells Fargo Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)) in Philadelphia""

I'm not from Philly so I'm totally holding my hands up here and asking sincerely, maybe I'm just not getting something, but I don't get why people celebrate other folk who left town and never came back.

I would like a place somewhat close to 95 as I work in the Cinnaminson/Moorestown NJ area and anything over a 35 minute commute sounds horrible for me. I l also want to be in a place with good nightlife and a younger crowd as we are all in our earlier 20s and I am painfully single. My ideal spot would be either Fishtown or NoLibs as they're both easy access to 95 and almost parallel with where I work. I would also be okay with Old City and Society Hill and Queen's Village granted there is a place to park my car. Roommate#1, lets call him Nick, is only planning on living in Philly for 12 more months and then is moving elsewhere for work. His current lease is ending in February and he is about to go on a work trip in two weeks so he needs to sign a lease ASAP. He works in NE Philly but he's insistent he doesn't care where we live as long as its under $2,100.  Roommate#2, lets call him Tommy, works in Center City West (think Comcast Building). At his current apartment he can walk 20 minutes to work and 15 minutes to his girlfriend's place in graduate hospital. He is insistent that he want to continue to be able to do this and has said that anywhere he cannot walk to work/ his girlfriends in under 30 mins is out of the question. Am I the asshole for pushing back on Tommy because of this? That criteria alone has made it so difficult to find a place that works for him and I. Am I being unreasonable here?

Even though the commute time is double on the train I'm definitely considering it just to avoid driving.

I see that Media is a Zone 3 stop on SEPTA site. I'm assuming this means I would need the Zone 3 TrailPass, correct? I feel like I've read anecdotes on r/philadelphia about being able to use a lower pass under certain situations.

1363,ThatQuil91,1580150841,eusbah,Nan,"Hi Reddit,

Probably going to cross-post a variation of this elsewhere but here it goes.
I got engaged last April after 10 years of people prodding, badgering, and cajoling us about settling down. We've decided to set a date for October 2021. I know I'm probably coming at all the details a little early but I'm a notorious manic planner and with this task soley falling on me and my fiance- I'm trying to get a bit of a headstart.
Like many other millenials our age we're a little tight for money and our dream wedding is pretty non-realistic. Hell, our mothers expectations are unrealistic as hell to boot. But I do think with the proximity of the city, the closeness of the airport and the general grittyness (pun intended) of the area we could still do something kick-ass and cool that will not burn a fiery hole in my bank account.
So here's the question- Do any of you know of any neat venues/places that are not ultra expensive to hold a wedding at? I've heard of the Power Plant Productions, The Curtis Arboretum and a few other cool joints. Trying to keep it lowkey- possibly just do some pick up catering and cocktails for a reception, as much as that's going to piss off a few of the more traditional guests. Honestly, any input is more than welcome- times have changed and both of our single mothers aren't much of a help.",philadelphia,Wedding venues for a broke pair of Jabronis
1364,yadadameannn,1580151844,euskfu,Nan," I honestly didn't know how to write this. First of all, I never fathomed putting together an obituary for Kobe Bean Bryant as he’s one of the few I deemed immortal. Secondly, I had no idea where to begin to describe his impact on my adolescence and my generation as a whole. Kobe was more than just one of the best to put the ball through the hoop in the history of Dr. James Naismith's game, he was the voice that told you to keep going when you thought you had nothing else. The motivator who led by example and proved that hard work combined with talent could lead to endless possibilities and the leader who detailed how lonely the role of captain could be. No. 24 practiced what he preached, going against the grain and showcasing how much one has to sacrifice to be extraordinary.  [https://4ormypeople.com/athletics/2020/1/27/24](https://4ormypeople.com/athletics/2020/1/27/24)",philadelphia,Tribute to Lower Merion Native and Superstar Kobe Bryant Tribute with Last Interview

Here's the story...

\- In a group chat, my buddy sent this Instagram posting of LeBron James in Philadelphia, remarking how the man in the background of the second photo looks exactly like me: [https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wziUcA6sJ/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wziUcA6sJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

\- I posted this to my own Instagram story and was met with many DMs in awe at the resemblance between him and I. Personally I've never seen someone who so closely resembles me.

\- One person suggested that I try to find him, because it would make an awesome selfie if he and I were to line up our paths one day. Which I think is a great idea, though I feel like at a minimum he would get a kick out of seeing this comparison photo, just as much as I did.

\- Since the photo was taken in Philadelphia, my first instinct was to post to the r/philadelphia subreddit, because if he lives/works in Philadelphia, it is very likely that someone here knows this man, and would have a way of bringing him to this post for one of the purposes mentioned above. 

So that's the story behind this post. I know this is a long, long shot... but if anybody knows this man, I'd be delighted to have the opportunity to be put in touch with him. I'd like to approach this as ethically as possible with regard to his privacy... so I'm perfectly cool with any course of action that best preserves that... perhaps you contact him, show him this post, and if he's interested in being put in touch with me for us to align a meet for a selfie one day we can possibly make that happen.

Thanks very much in advance! I'll be standing by to reply to any comments, including those providing alternate suggestions to this approach.

I was napping when one rang my bell this evening and I was so out of it because I just took a medication. My boyfriend answered the door and told me it’s from PECO. I told him it’s probably a scam and told him to ignore her. He insisted that I should talk to her since I pay the electric bill. 

Still groggy and just waking up, I start talking to her and she mentioned how PECO is doing refunds because they overcharged some of their customers by 3% and they are issuing refunds. She asked to see my PECO bill and account number. And I showed it to her (mistake #1). While she setup whatever bullshit on her ipad, she made small talks and asked questions like if I’m a student (I am not), if I’m home all the time (b/c my bill is so high), and what I do for a living. Me, being a, idiot and still out of it, said I work a 9-5 job... mistake #2.

So yeah, I clearly just gave her the days and hours I’m not gonna be home. I didn’t tell her about this but my boyfriend works an 11 hour shift 5 days a week but off for two days during the weekday. She also didn’t go inside my apartment, just outside in the hall so I don’t think she could even scope anything out but idk how clever these robbers are and I’m SUPER FUCKING paranoid now. 

After I talked to her, I sat there realizing my mistake. I called PECO customer service and they said they never send people out door-to-door. The lady told me not to answer any phone calls from them (the scammer got my phone number and said someone from VERDE will “issue” my refund) and I should call PECO back Thursday or Friday to see if there’s any changes in my account. 

Anyways, what are the chances that I’m gonna come home with all my stuff disappeared from my apartment? I’m paranoid as fuck now.",philadelphia,Almost got scammed by someone impersonating as a PECO employee. Am I gonna get robbed?

 I've got a problem and a question.

My Problem: As I'm currently living in an apartment complex there tends to be spill over from noisy neighbors. Now I typically would be relaxed on this topic. However, this disturbance effects my well being. My upstairs neighbors have two dogs over 30 lbs living in one 2 bedroom apartment. This is unbelievably loud.  During all hours of the day and for the bulk of the night &amp; then again at 4-5am  there is a dog barking or running back and fourth. So now I am able to fall asleep or stay asleep.

 Is there a legal route I can take to make sure that my noisy neighbors are being responsible?

Things I'd like changed: 
* I like what I had done to the sidebar.  The tables looked super tacky and it was driving me crazy.
* Also being able to add links to the header
* I am not a fan of Philadelphia's flag (I know u/Simon_the_Cannibal agrees it's a bad flag design)  Would anyone prefer something better?  I did the LOVE Park sign but we can do something better for that. [I even found this lovely redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/bhe5mj/redesigned_of_the_philadelphia_flag/) someone did over in r/vexillology that is better than our flag haha
* As much as I love our header, I'd love an updated one.  This subreddit hasn't been updated in some time.  The new comcast tower isn't even in there.  Where's our giant middle finger/vape pen!?  u/phrequency - if you see this, I'd love for you to do something similar (maybe even add Gritty!...or a giant furnace?)

I’m a 26 y/o male who recently moved to Philadelphia looking to pursue a career in event planning. While this would eventually turn into a side business (ideally) I’d like to spend a few years chasing this career path as organizing chaos and patience are my two strongest traits. 

I’ve spent all my years employed either working customer service or operations management in tandem with constantly sending emails and spending time on the phone. I’ve organized corporate parties at a venue and intermixed multiple groups with flawless timing to keep individuals entertained and not left waiting or unenthused.

In short, I’m looking for a local company or self-employed individual that could benefit from free labor in exchange for knowledge of the trade. I work from home and am available throughout the day, but more so after 5p and on weekends. 

I’ve always wanted to get into event planning and I’m certainly the ambitious type that can hold his own. If you know anyone or are an entity that could benefit from this exchange, please message me!

1526,dotcom-jillionaire,1580418960,ewcg3f,Nan,"Seriously, what in your mind are some practical steps to getting Philly to clean up its act? When you get out of this city and travel to NYC, DC, or even Baltimore you'll quickly see those places have a way better handle on their streets. Everything from garbage cans getting emptied regularly to the floors of the subway not being littered in chicken bones and soda bottles (and piss).

Clean streets don't happen miraculously, the two biggest things standing in Philly's way are the fact that we're smaller compared to NYC/DC (less tax revenue, less resources from the city for trash) and prevailing attitudes that throwing your shit on the ground is completely fine, that someone else will clear the litter in your community, and that ""fuck you it's already garbage here no one cares"" state of mind.

So how do we overcome this? Until the population of the city (read: the tax base) really begins to swell, and also until City Hall makes trash and cleanliness of our communities a priority, we're not going to feel any immediate changes. Changing people's attitudes is one thing, that takes time and reinforcement, but there have to be some practical steps normal people can take to try and push the city in the right direction. I'm presenting these as suggestions, not sure if they're workable in your experience, but hoping others can weigh in on both fronts (attitudes and practicals):

1) Report piles of trash on the 311 app. Not sure if these qualify as illegal dumping but when a garden bed in front of an abandoned house gets repurposed as a trash dump that seems like illegal dumping to me. Be a pain in the ass about reporting these on 311 too, everything and anything within reason.

2) Clean up around your own community! There's an abandoned warehouse across the street from me and we have lots of trees on our block. As a result huge piles of leaves and trash collect on the sidewalk of the factory and stay there forever since everyone feels ""hey not my problem"". I've been cleaning up these leaf/trash piles every few months because I give a shit about my block. It takes very little time to do on a Saturday and *many* people have come up to me and say they appreciate what I'm doing. The problem won't simply go away, but maybe next time I go to clean up I'll find someone already did it for me.

2a) Set the tone in your neighborhood by being visible in keeping things clean. It won't change the world but maybe it will convince a few people to do their part as well. Also sometimes, I believe, people want to help but need to see someone else do it before it convinces them they too can pick up a rake and take on a pile of leaves.

3) Advocacy. I'm not going to be the guy to start a citizens action committee regarding trash in this city, but honestly we need something like this. People need to start being a thorn in Kenny's side about trash and hold City Hall accountable for their lack of action here. Yeah sure street sweeper are coming but this isn't going to be a successful program and we all know it. How about some fucking trash cans on corners and sanitation workers to empty them instead?

4) Shame people. But in the passive aggressive social media way. If you have cameras posted on the street and you catch someone dumping trash, call them out for it. I don't think approaching someone on the street is a good idea but to each their own.

5) Participate in community cleanups or work to organize more. Some neighborhoods do these already. Contact your local community organization to see how you can get involved, maybe work with them to organize more cleanups in other parts of the city

But a lot of this isn't just you all putting in effort on your block, a lot of it comes down to ~being a pain in the ass~ to the city. In a nice way of course, but also in a constant nagging never-gonna-stop-till-you-do-something-about-it kind of way. In terms of changing people's attitudes over all, that's one hell of a solution, but in some small part I think people will react to positive changes around them especially if they see it and it impacts their block.

No biggie, he knew it was a risk and we were at fault. The issue comes from when he tried to pay the ticket. 

Their website was down so my boyfriend decided to pay the ticket in person. He received a little receipt with carbon copy attached. Mind you, this was the second week of November. We didn’t expect any issues to occur so he didn’t try to keep track of the receipt. In January, I received a notice in the mail that we still didn’t pay. I called customer service and since we didn’t have the receipt they said to bring in the CC statement &amp; ticket # and they will take care of it. So he did that. They said give it two weeks to resolve. Then, we got another notice saying it’s still not paid. So I called again, they said to mail the statement and ticket # to prove he paid.

1666,publu123,1580672657,extw4y,Nan,"Hi everyone, 

I recently graduated college and moved into an apartment for the first time. Late last year, we had some intense drama regarding the electricity bill. The bill was never transferred to us and the old tenants' mail was coming to us. We realized there was a $1100 electricity bill from this summer that was never paid. Our lease had started in August and we were terrified. We went over to Peco and explained the situation and they said its not up to them. Thankfully, they billed me, the new tenant, in November with just the October bill-we felt spared and saved. 

Yesterday, we discovered that a similar thing happened with the gas. We were confused that we hadn't received anything related to the gas bill, and thought huh, maybe the old tenants are paying for that and never transferred it over? They've completely ghosted us so we didn't know what to do. A mail came in from the Philadelphia Gas Company to a tenant that lived here not one, but potentially two or many years ago (we know the names of the last three people who occupied this space and this mail was addressed to none of them). It is also a $1300 dollar bill-even though gas is only $13 a month. 

At the end of the day, we just want to pay our gas bill so it doesn't get shut down. We're happy to pay the gas bill for since our lease started in August, but nothing more. Do you think the philadelphia gas company will understand our situation? What is your experiences with their customer service?",philadelphia,Utility drama/question about philadelphia gas

3. I know the key card slowly rolled out to regional rail.. so can I use it for zone 3 to get out to the Moylan Rose Valley Station on both weekdays and weekends?

Thank you so much for any help!",philadelphia,Help with SEPTA key card?? It’s kinda confusing

From https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2012/05/22/americas-oldest-italian-restaurant-is-now-ralphs/%3famp=1

Fior D’Italia, America’s oldest Italian restaurant has closed its doors after 126 years. The San Francisco restaurant closed on May 21st after first opening up in 1886. Originally the restaurant was located on Broadway in San Fran, but when it burned down a few years later it made a few hops around town before landing at a new spot until 2005.

When that location was also struck by fire the restaurant was forced to move again and partner Trudy Audieri says the move may be partially to blame for the closing. Today’s weak economy further hurt the restaurant, leaving a gap in American-Italian and foodie history.

Fortunately for Philadelphia, (we’re sorry, San Fran, we really are) one of our very own restaurants is filling that gap: Ralph’s Italian Restaurant on 9th Street.

At over 100 years old, all of which it has spent under the Dispigno family, Ralph’s is now America’s Oldest Italian restaurant. Though it has been Philly’s oldest for quite a while, the City of Brotherly Love is happy to now have this prestigious national title in the area.

Congratulations Dispigno family!

We swear we send our condolences to Fior D’Italia, but we do wish there was some sort of trophy to pass along ….",philadelphia,"TIL the oldest Italian restaurant in America is in Philly. Ralph’s Italian Restaurant on 9th and Catherine, is 120 years old this year."

But don't feel the need to rush to turn on the radio this moment! Since the Eagles season ended on January 5 -- except for one day discussing Andy Reid and the Super Bowl -- the topic of ""Ben Simmons Doesn't Shoot Enough and Must Be Traded"" has taken up virtually every second of every show on both stations, and will no doubt continue to do so until the Phillies season starts. So don't worry, as long as WIP and The Fanatic are on the air, they will be discussing how ""Ben Simmons Doesn't Shoot Enough and Must Be Traded"" 24/7 for the next seven weeks. Of course, after about five minutes, you will have heard all there is to hear about it really. But stay tuned anyway, I guess. 

As a public service announcement to Philly sports fans, there's also an NHL hockey team in Philly called the ""Flyers,"" but for some reason any topic involving them has been banned from both Philly sports radio stations. Too bad, because they're having a hell of a season with a new world-class coach, a new system that's exciting as hell to watch, new free-agents and rising stars all on fire, they're playing great and entertaining team hockey, and they're in a playoff position. If you want to talk about them, just go up to anyone with a mullet or a Canadian passport for some great conversation. Just don't try to talk about them on 94.1 WIP or 97.5 The Fanatic because those stations are super busy trying to get to the bottom of this whole ""Ben Simmons Doesn't Shoot Enough and Must Be Traded"" business, which is *eternally* fascinating, aparently.",philadelphia,PHILLY SPORTS RADIO ALERT!!!

This makes me think that when I turn and toss in my bed and Im too close to the wall, they can hear it. Someone else on city-data said the same thing.  I had situations where I was being spied on if I go to work, they come out the same exact time I come out, or they run to the window. Ive done nothing but mind my own business.

&amp;#x200B;

New campaign finance reports are (mostly) in for several Philadelphia elected officials who are [potential candidates for mayor](https://www.inquirer.com/news/2023-philly-mayoral-race-begins-now-20190911.html) in 2023 to succeed Jim Kenney**.**

 

 Let’s take a look at the Democratic field — Philly is, after all, an  overwhelmingly Democratic city. And then let’s talk about why the  candidates are likely to be overshadowed in the money race, again, by  big-spending outside interests.

&amp;#x200B;

   Here’s how much money the contenders had in their campaign accounts as of Jan. 1, in descending order.

 

**Rebecca Rhynhart.**  The only person on this list who is not also on City Council is also  the most flush with cash, since she didn’t have to run a campaign last  year. Rhynhart, who was elected city controller in 2017 and is [keeping her options open](https://www.inquirer.com/news/next-philadelphia-mayor-2023-20191106.html) for 2023, [had $353,522 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IlJlYmVjY2EgZm9yIFBoaWxhZGVscGhpYSAvIDcgQW5udWFsIFJlcG9ydCIsImZSZXBvcnQiOjMxNTN9) at the start of the year.

**Helen Gym.**  Stop us if you’ve heard this one before: Gym is in first place in the  money race among Council members. The top Council at-large vote-getter  from 2019 leads the 2023 Council pack with[ $51,337 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IkZyaWVuZHMgb2YgSGVsZW4gR3ltIC8gNyBBbm51YWwgUmVwb3J0IiwiZlJlcG9ydCI6MzIxN30=).

 

**Cherelle L. Parker.** The former state representative and [newly elevated Council majority leader](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/philadelphia/philly-city-council-majority-leader-cherelle-parker-bobby-henon-20200106.html)  starts her second term representing Council’s 9th District, which  encompasses parts of Northwest and Northeast Philadelphia, with [$44,333 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IlBlb3BsZSBGb3IgUGFya2VyIC8gNyBBbm51YWwgUmVwb3J0IiwiZlJlcG9ydCI6MzEyMX0=).

   

**María Quiñones-Sánchez.**  She starts her fourth term in the 7th District, which stretches from  North Philadelphia through Kensington and up to Oxford Circle, having  once again defied the Democratic establishment, and with [$35,003 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IkZyaWVuZHMgb2YgTWFyaWEgLyA3IEFubnVhbCBSZXBvcnQiLCJmUmVwb3J0IjozMjQyfQ==).

 

**Derek Green.** This at-large member enters his second term with [$11,974 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IkdyZWVuIGZvciBQaGlsYWRlbHBoaWEgLyA3IEFubnVhbCBSZXBvcnQiLCJmUmVwb3J0IjozMjIyfQ==).

**Allan Domb.** Don’t get tricked by the numbers here. This real-estate investor starts his second term in an at-large seat with [just $2,613 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IkFsbGFuIERvbWIgZm9yIENpdHkgQ291bmNpbCAvIDcgQW5udWFsIFJlcG9ydCIsImZSZXBvcnQiOjMyMjV9)  and $198,000 in campaign debt. But all that debt is owed to himself,  reflecting the very deep pockets of the wealthiest member of Council. If  he runs, he could be a self-funding contender.

 

**Bobby Henon.** Hear us out on this third-termer from the river wards of the 6th District, [currently under federal indictment](https://www.inquirer.com/news/john-dougherty-johnny-doc-ibew-local-union-full-indictment-philadelphia-20190130.html) with other officials from [Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers](https://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/john-dougherty-ibew-johnny-doc-bobby-henon-brian-burrows-michael-neill-marita-crawford-indictment-20190130.html). He [has $29,481 in the bank](https://apps.phila.gov/campaign-finance/pdf/v2/eyJmaWxlTmFtZSI6IkJvYmJ5IDExIC8gNyBBbm51YWwgUmVwb3J0IiwiZlJlcG9ydCI6MzIxMH0=)  and $38,427 in debt, putting him almost $9,000 into the red. But some  in City Hall aren’t counting him out for 2023 if he can survive the  trial. He and other other union officials have pleaded not guilty.

 

**Cindy Bass.** The third-termer from Northwest Philadelphia’s 8th District hasn’t yet filed her annual report, which was due Friday.

 

 Campaign donations can be a key indicator of electoral potential. But  we’re also keeping an eye on where political action committees (PACs)  are placing their dollars, and in what amounts.



That’s because 2019 saw a repeat of a trend first spotted in 2015, when so-called independent expenditure PACs [outspent the candidates for mayor](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/mayor/20150619_Independent_groups_raised_more_than__11_5_million_for_Phila__s_Democratic_mayoral_primary.html).  These PACs can raise and spend money undeterred by the city’s campaign  finance limits, as long as they don’t coordinate with a candidate or  campaign.

 

 Forward Together Philadelphia raised almost $1.6 million to support  Kenney’s bid for reelection, even though he was never in danger of  losing the Democratic primary and [didn’t even bother to campaign in the general](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philadelphia-mayor-jim-kenney-election-results-20191106.html). Former New York Mayor **Michael Bloomberg**, now a presidential candidate and a fan of [Kenney’s soda tax](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/philadelphia/philadelphia-soda-tax-national-beverage-industry-20200128.html), [kicked in $1 million](https://www.inquirer.com/news/mike-bloomberg-mayor-jim-kenney-campaign-finance-soda-tax-political-action-committees-20190510.html), while teachers’ unions put up $250,000 and trial lawyers contributed $300,000.

 

Philly 2019, funded by local building trades unions, [raised an additional $931,869](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philadelphia-mayor-jim-kenney-election-results-20191106.html)  to support Kenney in the primary, with $400,000 coming from Local 98  and $200,000 from the Steamfitters Local 420.

1809,dablkscorpio,1580913904,ezak85,Question? :snoo_thoughtful:,"TLDR: Should I move to Yorktown for the cheap rent?


So I'm planning on moving to Philly 5/01 and I've been doing my research. I want to live somewhere diverse and within 30 minutes (preferably less) to Center City. At first University City seemed like a great fit. I'm as young as most undergrads and there would be plenty of stuff to do. I'm also looking at surrounding areas like Spruce Hill and Cedar Park.

I can find places in my price range &lt;$800 but the places that really peak my interest are often around $850, which I suppose is fine especially when utilities are covered. But every so often I find a place in Yorktown and/or North Philly for less than $700 which always catches my attention!

I moved on from Yorktown intially because of talk of crime. I'm from NYC, so the attitude towards Yorktown seemed equivalent to how people feel about the Bronx. I've lived in the Bronx and I wouldn't be worried about living there. I also live in Bedstuy, the part that hasn't been fully gentrified yet, and there are regular crackheads and the like. So of that's what I need to be worried about then it's not so bad. (In general I feel that what I hear about unsafe areas are largely true but also partly exagerated by perceptions of race and poverty that aren't fully understood. But I'm threw away the idea initially because the negativity around Yorktown was very pervasive.)

The negativity around Yorktown albeit is so pervasive that it is hard to ignore. But it's very-- almost impossibly-- hard to ignore the cheap rent that I keep seeing. 

However, I do not want to negate what could be honest reviews based on my own biases and frugality. That said, part of me wants to ask you guys to convince me that Yorktown isn't all that bad. I mean, the rent is so cheap that's what I'm looking to hear. But what I need to hear is the good and bad. Yorktown versus University City. Pros and cons.",philadelphia,Tell me about Yorktown.

**Psychedelic experiences are known to be some of the most profoundly moving of one’s life, and researchers are finding early success with psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction, and PTSD. Outside of a clinical setting--with peer groups, underground therapists, or in ceremonial settings--these experiences can range from intensely terrifying to profoundly positive. Yet, the average therapist has little training on how to help patients reduce the potential for harm and weave these experiences into the course of therapy, enhancing the potential for a beneficial outcome. In this talk, we present a way of shifting the paradigm in psychotherapy to include psychedelic experiences as potentially valuable in the quest for healing.**

This weekend, I got into a situation that made me decide to go get it tomorrow and I'd like some advice from someone who is possibly familiar with the legalilty of this.

I was walking home from the Dew Inn Saturday morning after eating breakfast and I past by 3 ""teens"" on Girard. One looked at me and said ""Yo you're the guy who tried to rob us last night"", all of his boys stopped right then and there. I was so taken back by this that I just kept walking, they followed. ""YO! You're the guy who tried to rob us, yeahhhhh look he's wearing the same shit as last night"" I looked over my shoulder while walking and said ""what the fuck are you talking about"". My adrenaline started rushing, all 3 of them were getting really close to my back. ""where you going?""

That's when I turned around and asked him if he's going to swing, do it now. He acted like he was grabbing something from his waist and then smiled at me and walked away with his boys.

My question is, if I was physically attacked by 3 of these guys and they DIDN'T have a weapon, would I legally be allowed to shoot? I feel like in Philadelphia, being attacked by a young group like this is one of the more probable situations. Would my life be ruined if they had me on the group and I decided to use deadly force?

I am from NYC and have done the apartment hunting process here more times than I can count. In NYC it’s rushed and cutthroat. Usually people apply for apartments the day-of viewing and must be prepared to put down 3+ months of rent on the spot.

My boyfriend and I are planning on moving to Philly and secure a lease beginning Aug or Sep 2020.

We are open to most neighborhoods but would prefer something more affordable, good for beginning a small family, and with good public transit to Center City. 

Some questions:
* Any recommended neighborhoods? I was looking into Germantown and Kensington, but am honestly open to anything. 
* What is the general apartment hunting/renting process in Philly? Is it “boom boom boom” where everything is completed within 48 hours? 
*What do landlords generally want upfront for move-in?
* I believe we would have mid-range incomes (haven’t yet secured jobs) based on our current incomes in NYC and a quick look at Glassdoor. I believe we would make approx $100k combined (currently making $160k+ in NYC).

About me: Mid-20's, SO goes to Villanova and will be living with me, have a dog, and we both have cars. We like bars and going out but it's not always central focus of our social lives. 

I'd prefer a place that we could both get to class (Villanova and Temple) by car or train within 30 minutes. I also would like a place that would be good for having a dog. I'm from Boston and don't know much about Philly but so far Manayunk or East Falls seem like they could be a good area for me and seems like a 15 minute drive to campus.

I am having some trouble finding organizations/activities that would interest me, so I am looking for some suggestions here.  My university doesn't offer many activities for grad students.

About me: I'm a (sometimes shy) introvert in my mid-20s. I am passionate about civic duty and progressive politics (some might call me a leftist). I care about educational equity, helping the economically less fortunate, and racial justice.

I enjoy listening to podcasts, playing board games, and practicing my coding skills (mostly in R). I also like reading novels, especially coming of age novels.  However, I also love non-fiction writing and enjoy reading non-fiction stories, longform writing, and politically-minded essays.

I am also a big fan of indie music and enjoy attending concerts for up-and-coming artists  in smaller venues. Likewise, I also like watching movies produced by lesser-known studios.

I am looking to meet people in my age range, 20-30ish.

I just moved to s front/ritner st. in Whitman and this is the third time this guy has knocked on my door. I don’t answer the door for randos so I haven’t answered but it’s happened multiple times now and it’s starting to freak me &amp; my roommate out.

What throws me off is that he’ll knock a few times before leaving - knock then wait a minute or two and try again. That’s persistent for a canvasser/scammer. Also the time of day - it’s happened around 730p last Thursday, 730a the very next  morning then just now again at 8p. Pretty aggressive knocking tonight. He parked his car across the street (a black SUV but not sure what make/model and it’s too dark to see license plate) and I saw him walk up to our door. A middle aged bald man.

*TLDR:  New to Philly, job at Temple Hospital, $2000/month budget, public transit important, cool dog needs space, food/beer (yay)*

We're moving to Philadelphia from Columbus, OH this summer (June/July-ish) for my GF's new job at Temple University Hospital. 
 I've searched the sub quite a bit (both posts and the sidebar).  My issue is I've never been to Philly so I have zero reference regarding the neighborhoods besides the nice write-ups.  I pretty much know what's regarded as ""good/bad/in-between.""  We also can't get out your way until April due to her current work.  I really just want to zero in on a few areas so we can maximize our time there (or possibly direct a broker to neighborhoods that work for us).

Our situation:

-She will be working for Temple University Hospital 9-5 (I know that area isn't great)

-I telework but will have to travel periodically 

-We have a small dog (an outdoor area for him would be nice for times when we can't walk him)

-We have 2 cars (would like to drop to 1 and rely on transit/minimize parking hassle if possible)

-We'd prefer a house/duplex (maybe like 3 bed/1.5 bath)

-Easy access to transit to Temple Hospital (she'd prefer not to deal with parking if possible)
--probably worth noting that we are complete novices when it comes to public transit.  Columbus is quite lacking in that respect.

-Budget of $2000 a month (max)

-We'd like to be close to a few restaurants/bars but don't really need to be in the middle of any booming night-life (We old)

Neighborhoods like Graduate Hospital and Queen Village have popped out to me but it sounds like transit could be lacking there (at least in Queen Village).    

We're only going to be in Philadelphia for a year most likely and we want to live somewhere where we can really enjoy the city for our stay and not be relegated to the 'burbs and shackled to our cars.

Any direction/advice is welcomed.  I'll also take my lumps as I'm sure these posts annoy you as much as it annoys the Columbus sub.

Thanks again!",philadelphia,It's about moving...I'm sorry.

Oops! We've never paid for water before and have lived in multiple different apartments so we just weren't careful enough.

It looks like there's a bill in our mail today for it but it's addressed to our landlord. We can certainly pay for it but in order to avoid a backlog and potential water shut off in the future we'll have to set up a tenant account so we can pay monthly.

However, our landlord is impossible to reach. I've emailed her at least three times since November asking about it but she has never responded. She barely responds to anything as it is.

**Psychedelic experiences are known to be some of the most profoundly moving of one’s life, and researchers are finding early success with psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction, and PTSD. Outside of a clinical setting--with peer groups, underground therapists, or in ceremonial settings--these experiences can range from intensely terrifying to profoundly positive. Yet, the average therapist has little training on how to help patients reduce the potential for harm and weave these experiences into the course of therapy, enhancing the potential for a beneficial outcome. In this talk, we present a way of shifting the paradigm in psychotherapy to include psychedelic experiences as potentially valuable in the quest for healing.** 

Here is the [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/psychedelic-integration-in-psychotherapy-introducing-a-paradigm-shift-tickets-89486533631?aff=affiliate1) for our event - it is open to the public!

 World Cafe Live, an intimate club that’s been part of the Philadelphia music scene for 15 years, will soon become a non-profit venue.

Owner Hal Real announced that the space will now be owned by his non-profit organization Live Connections, which has aimed to benefit music education in Philadelphia schools for more than a decade. Speaking with the [***Philadelphia Inquirer***](https://www.inquirer.com/entertainment/philadelphia-concerts-world-cafe-live-non-profit-live-nation-tanya-tucker-20200212.html), Real reassured concertgoers that the venue will continue to provide the same experience but with a different value.

“What will change is that they’ll know that every dollar they’re spending will be reinvested in the programming,” Real told the publication. “Also, it will be going into the facilities, so we can maintain this on a quality level and don’t have to be compromised because we’re trying to compete with[(read more...)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/philadelphias-world-cafe-live-is-becoming-a-non-profit-venue/)",philadelphia,Philadelphia’s World Cafe Live Is Becoming A Non-Profit Venue

I'm really opting to find a place I could live on my own, such as a studio or single bedroom, but the market/reality for that type of thing seems difficult to find around Philadelphia/surrounding suburbs for a good or even reasonable deal for the budget I figure I have.

Applying the thirty percent housing rule to my current income, I'm looking at about $1000, however, I'd also be moving jobs and would very likely have a higher income after leaving the job I'm at now. 

I am so emphatic to move out of my current residence that I would be willing to go higher to $1200-$1300 for rent if the deal were good, but it seems finding any complexes for any price around the Philadelphia surrounding areas are pretty bleak.

I haven't really looked anywhere within the city for fear of living in the city for my first time by myself, and also having family pressure me about living in the city, ""what if you get mugged"", etc.

So what's your take on Philly tap water VS filtered water. I've had people tell me that Philly tap water is very healthy and one of the best in the US because they add fluoride for your teeth as well as other minerals that are good for you. I've also had people tell me to stay away from tap water in general because they say its not good. There are also people who tell me that filtered water removes the good minerals that tap water has. So I was wondering what the general consensus was. Do you think Philly tap water is fine to drink or even healthy to drink or do you think filtered water is the way to go?

So you know when a vehicle is sitting at a red light (for instance, on Broad St) - with (but likely without) their left blinker on, to indicate the intent to turn left - and before the light turns green (presumably in the moments before the cross light turns red and their light turns green), they turn left?

Regardless of the fact that this move is unequivocally illegal, as the vehicle has just fundamentally run a red light; and is questionably moral, as it puts pedestrians in harm’s way (as the car now needs to clear two lanes of oncoming traffic before the oncoming light turns green, causing it to have to speed past any pedestrian crosswalk in the way, just so the driver could save maybe twenty seconds), it is just a uniquely Philly thing I see people do practically every day. 

And, so, was curious if this trick had some fun monicker? Hopefully - as I’m sure any South Philly resident would be sure would be my intent - so I could adequately paint in word-pictures the obscene vulgarity of this squalid, sub-cultural backwater to all my friends back in Brooklyn?

My situation is that they came out several times to fix my fridge. First it was a water leak out of the ice maker. Ice was being produced at this point but when using the water dispenser, it would leak. After multiple appointments and parts, they may have stopped the leak but the solution broke the ice maker. The last tech that came out broke the plastic trim around the water dispenser/ice maker/control panel. They put in a service request to fix the plastic piece that HSA denied because apparently that part isn't covered under contract. Then when I told HSA that it was broken by Universal 1's tech, they called Universal to confirm this, and Universal lied to them and told them they didn't break it... Then why did they make the service repair request with HSA?

She says the reason she's asking is because her cell phone apparently reported its last location from my exact address. I tell her I'm sorry, I don't know anything and haven't heard of this person before. She said that sometimes these GPS reports from phones aren't that accurate but they just have to verify anyway. I told her sorry and hope you find her. Then she went straight to her cruiser, sat there for a minute or two, flipped on lights and sirens and drove away.

Find it a bit concerning that she came straight to my house and then left without checking with any neighbors on either side of the house/street?

Celebrate whatever holiday you want! Christmas! Halloween! Diwali! Cinco De Mayo! You name it, we will celebrate with you on leap day!  


\*\*There will be a White Elephant with a $20 limit around 8 pm for anyone that brings a wrapped gift.\*\* All gifts will be put into a pile and all participants will receive a random number. Starting with person number one, you can either take a wrapped gift or take a gift someone else has opened. If someone takes your gift, it then becomes your turn to take a gift that has not been stolen this round or grab an unopened gift. When an unopened gift is grabbed, the next participant in numerical order starts a new round.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*St Stephen’s Green has a television that we can use for video games if anyone is willing to bring a system.\*\* This event will be situated in the basement with a private bartender. Street parking is free, but it might not be abundant; there are a couple of reasonably priced garages near the location - 16th/Mt Vernon and 17th/Green, both of which are one block away.

&amp;#x200B;

St Stephen’s Green is also a short walk away from the Spring Garden stop on the Broad St Line, and the 43 can pick you up from the Market-Frankford line and drop you off two blocks away.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*NEWCOMERS ARE WELCOMED! This is a great opportunity to meet new people!\*\*

One person said that he had done independent testing of his tap water and was told it was not safe to drink. Many agencies will probably tell you this to sell you an expensive filtration system. Penn State University offers drinking water quality testing and they post the results for all the samples they receive on their website. They seem like a decent unbiased source.

[Here's Philadelphia county's data, but all counties are available there.](https://agsci.psu.edu/aasl/water-testing/drinking-water-testing/drinking-water-test-summaries/philadelphia)

* Corrosivity Index - 63.6%
* Lead - 8.3%

We need to knock some shit off, especially on this sub. This whole transplants vs. lifelong is bullshit. Politics, which were made to separate us, is the place where I think a lot of this shit starts. I’m a lifelong resident. 35. Some of you transplants annoy the fuck out of me, but at the end of the day, it’s because you guys are so nice. Some of you truly believe that everyone in the world is terrific. I commend you for that. I can’t live that way, this city has proven that it cannot be trusted. 

With that said the holdovers and the transplants all have something in common. We are all here because we like it. We are all here because we think the neighborhood we are in is safe. We may have different ideas on how to keep them safe, but we all want the best for our areas. 

The SIS made me think about something. When I was a kid, Passyunk Ave. was what Broad Street looks like now. A couple stores, dead a lot of the time. Did have the awesome King of Jeans. It was most transplants/hipsters that revitalized Passyunk Ave. and it’s great now. 

What I’m getting at is, it’s really time to get together. This SIS was jammed down a lot of our throats, transplants who moved into a neighborhood because they liked it, and holdovers who have lived here, doing our best to keep it nice. The city, these politicians don’t care about any of us. They just want us to come out and vote. They sold us all out, the residents. We the people, are all we have. Time to knock the shit off and stick together. 

To the holdovers, it’s never going going to be how it was. Times change. This place, this neighborhood is still better and unique than any place in the world 

To the transplants, you belong to this now. This is yours now too. Stop looking down on those who’ve lived here. We’ve seen some shit.",philadelphia,I’ll be that guy...

I posted about a potential r/philadelphia book club and there was a lot of interest. I also asked about whether to have it as a thread in here or as a separate subreddit and there was a good split about which. I am thinking to have the first thread on this subreddit with subsequent ‘club meetings’ held in a separate subreddit. I think this will help with awareness and visibility for people who wanna join. Furthermore, there was some interest in a physical meet-up to discuss the books which I am open to. I like the thread idea as it allows users who may have schedule conflicts, accessibility issues, the opportunity to participate but I wouldn’t mind a physical meetup component to complement the thread.

Thanks to everyone for the input it was very helpful and very appreciated. Based on user input, it looks like every other month would be a good timeframe for people with their schedules etc. also there was interest in the book choices having a Philadelphia connection, whether it is setting, author, characters, or even a minor connection. u/bespeigel suggested THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN as the first choice which we are going to go ahead with. Thanks u/bespeigel you’re a goddamn hero ✌️

The first thread will be posted on Thursday, April 9th, which will be for the discussion as well as link to the separate subreddit. All of this is tentative and any input is greatly desired and appreciated. Thanks and Happy Friday!",philadelphia,Reddit Philadelphia Book Club Follow-up

3067,LookItsARainbow,1583023908,fbm7e7,Nan,"Hi, I found a subreddit about neighborhoods but posts are disabled and any hoods that had descriptions was 5 years old. Can anyone share their thoughts on vibe of Callowhill/Fairmount area vs Old City? 

CallowHill/Fairmount: 
From my brief experience walking around one weekend, Callow hill has some apartment buildings, a very small Target, and a Whole Foods. I wasn’t impressed with the bars/restaurants in the neighborhood but could easily walk elsewhere. A bit quiet, but seemed safe and the type of place where if you have large windows you are spaced out enough from other buildings that you can keep the blinds open during the day to let the sun in.

Old City: 
I liked that there was a good mix of small restaurants and easy access to the nice food court or places on Chestnut st. Nice mix of hoagie shops or different cuisines. There’s a small CVS and a small movie theater. May be a bit louder and buildings closer together and tend to be older because of course, Old City. Read many tourists in this area summertime.

Thinking of renting an apartment in one of these neighborhoods, I plan to revisit to check it out myself again but any info that someone can share would be useful as I live out of state. Thank you.",philadelphia,Neighborhoods: Callowhill vs Old City?

I’ve lived here for 20+ years but can’t say that I’ve ever been the one to recommend where to get them. Usually I have them at tailgates and I’m on beer duty not hoagie duty. I’ve done some research but instead of following Philly Mag or Eater, is rather hear from you guys.   When I accidentally did a brief stint in the burbs (stupid marriage) I went to Paganos in Drexel Hill. If that helps at all. 

He also asked for wings but I don’t think Philly is necessarily know for. My favorites are at moriarty's but I think that just nostalgic for me.

Through 2018 my rates have been billed as $63 every 11 weeks, we get just Sat. and Sun. editions plus full digital. Here are the issues:

* Rates are supposed to be 13 week periods. Turns out we've been billed in 11 week increments. They claim that there are special editions that come out which to pay for them they reduce the term of your subscription. That is an effrective 18% increase in your rates. I don't think we recevice anywhere close to 18% more papers.

* On 9/30 the rate jumped a massive $27 up to 90.35/11 weeks for the very same Sat. and Sun. service. This was totally unannounced.

I called and bitched. I was told by the customer agent that a lot of people are having this happen and are calling in. She said  the current regime is pushing though massive price increases and not telling people.

The webiste lists subs as $26/13 weeks for Sunday only, $52/13 weeks for the full load. I was being charged $90/11 weeks of just weekend papers. The terms on the website subs do not indicate it is a teaser rate. They state the renewals are at the same rate unless you are notified. We were not.

What was done:

The agent renewed me at $40/13 weeks of weekend papers only. She said all you have to do is call, they are doing this for everyone. She warned that they will push the rates up again, call again to get the rates restored.

3263,NorthernPossibility,1583350752,fdif5d,Nan,"Hey guys, I posted a while ago about a huge pile of debris and litter in my neighborhood. The city did end up cleaning it up, which was great. 

*However* it is becoming evident that someone is continuously using that same spot to illegally dump. We have now entered a vicious cycle where, on a random non-trash-day, a pile of trash will appear. It’s usually one or two trash bags and a dozen paper takeout bags stuffed with food waste, trash and recycling. Obviously with the wind and rain and animals, those paper bags tear, leaving trash everywhere. The trash guys for my area are very by-the-book when it comes to what they’ll pick up, which usually means “no plastic bag, no pick up”, so trash day comes and goes and the pile stays. 

The pile will accumulate for a few weeks, and then someone will come pick it up. I think it’s the city, but it usually happens while I’m at work so I can’t be sure. So far I’ve tried 311 tickets and “no dumping” signs, but the signs have been torn down and the trash continues. I know that the city issues trash fines for trash that is put out improperly or on the wrong day, but the dumping doesn’t stop. 

Is there something I can do about this? I care a lot about my neighborhood and it’s disappointing that whoever keeps dumping doesn’t seem to care that it’s making an entire block into a cesspit. I need some creative solutions, or maybe permission to do what literally the entire rest of my neighborhood does and give up.",philadelphia,"West Philly, Trash Pile Part Two, and Giving Up."

Plus, we're only about an 18 minute walk from our vet, so getting our dog there and back is usually fine.

If you have to block cross walks, cut off pedestrians who have the right of way, wait for green in an opposing travel lane, or cut off traffic just to pass them; again, please don't.

I'm not saying you can't pass people, even people stopped at an intersection. But please don't be an asshat and do it unsafely or repeatedly after they pass you again and again.

And if someone else is stopped, maybe there's a good reason why and you should consider that and slow down to assess the situation before blasting through the intersection like an asshat. What did you save? Three seconds and your power trip?


While we're at it, in my opinion:

I'm not saying you can't go through a red AS LONG AS YOU LOOK AND YEILD to both pedestrians and cars. I'm not saying you can't perform a rolling stop at a stop sigh AS LONG AS YOU LOOK AND YEILD to both pedestrians and cars.

Some may disagree with this, but it's better than the alternative of not slowing down and stopping at all which I see on a daily basis and it gets worse with all the warm weather bikers that start coming out this time of year.

I disputed the charges and provided a photo of my parking slip from the garage in Allentown that had my entry and exit times. The charges on the card were all clustered in about a 45 minute period, with the first being two minutes after I left the garage; it would be impossible for me to get to Philly and swipe into a subway station (in West Philly, nowhere near where I work or live) in that time frame.

I got this response today. I had my keycard the entire time, so no, it was not used. Now I'm wondering how many other times septa's fucked me over with this. Check your card use history.

We do not have weeds (especially in March) as my partner genuinely enjoys tending to our diminutive city green spaces. What we *do have* that could draw attention are a pair of hefty rosemary bushes which admittedly could use a clean-up trimming (think Sideshow Bob's hair). They are certainly NOT blocking anyone's egress/progress: they hang no more than a foot beyond our garden wall and the sidewalk is wide. These bushes are among 25+ plant species including many other edible herbs.

 I am angry, one, because my bushes seem to be quite explicitly excluded by [the code](http://www.paa-east.com/uploads/3/1/1/4/31149221/pm_code_chapter_3.pdf):

&gt; PM-302.4 Weeds. All premises and exterior property shall be maintained free from weeds or plant growth in excess of 10 inches. All noxious weeds shall be prohibited. Weeds shall be defined as all grasses, annual plants and vegetation, **other than trees or shrubs** provided; however, **this term shall not include cultivated flowers and gardens**. 

I am even angrier, two, because my block is a *fucking dump*. Many of my neighbors just do not give a single shit and there is trash all over the place. Within a block-and-a-half radius there are dozens of abandoned vehicles. The trash collection staff are Tasmanian Devils on trash day making a bad situation even worse.

Riders are disproportionately low-income. People are already up in arms about $1 transfer fees. It would benefit vision zero, by encouraging fewer people to drive to work. Ease traffic, and discourage car ownership.

To me, it seems like it would fit with all Kenney's stated goals for Philly.

I have been to philly a few times and really like it! I love DC too, I really love it, but it's just getting too expensive for me. I really like the nightlife, events, walkability, my tribe in DC, and public transit, but I like money too.

I am in my 30s. I like warehouse parties, live music (rock, post rock, experimental), house and electronic music, cultural activites, fitness, yoga, and like be around zoomers, Millenials, and later Xers. I am pretty open minded and progressive.

DC has a reputation for being kinda stuff and boring and full of yuppies. It is kinda true, but its so big it has a lot of cool people, and I am linked in with the creative class, artist, and people in the service industry. I go to a lot of dope parties. I am looking to form new connections with people, whether it be friendships, polyamorous relationships, or just hook ups.

I like places like Brooklyn and Portland too, I am that kinda person, not a hipster but just a laid back go with the flow and have fun kinda guy. Can Philly compare with these places?

Ideally id like somewhere I can mature a little. I still want to do cool things but I am in my 30s I suppose I should try to kinda be an adult.

The parent has self-quarantined herself and her child. Because of this and any possible transmission to community members, all Cheltenham School District buildings will be closed Tuesday, March 10 through Friday, March 13. This decision was reached in consultation with the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, and made out of an abundance of caution. As of this afternoon, there are only five confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Montgomery County, none in the Cheltenham School District.

In addition, to reduce or mitigate possible exposure by our students and staff, all field trips have been canceled until students return from spring break on Monday, April 13. The Legislative Board meeting on Tuesday, March 10 will be rescheduled. All CSD buildings are closed to co-curricular activities, and outside organizations with events scheduled in district buildings are also canceled until further notice. 

During this four-day closure, maintenance and custodial staff will deep clean all seven schools and the administration building. Cleaning crews will pay special attention to high-touch areas, including door knobs, railings, desktops, student chairs, toilets, soap dispensers, toilet flush handles, faucets, sinks, water fountains, paper towel dispensers, light switches, handles, buttons, sanitary receptacles, countertops-reception, lids and push bars.

The district included four “snow days” in the 2019-20 calendar, and, therefore, these four days will not count against the 180 student days the Pennsylvania Department of Education requires. District administration will use these four days to devise a remote learning plan should a need to close schools arise again. During April’s professional learning day for teachers, remote learning plans will be further developed as a contingency.

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, beginning later this week or next week, Secretary Pedro Rivera will be hosting weekly coronavirus updates via Zoom for superintendents. Some of the issues to be addressed include athletics, PSSAs and the 180 day rule.

Upon their return to school, students will participate in an assembly about appropriate hygiene habits, including washing hands with soap and water for no less than 20 seconds and not touching their face. 

To reiterate the point from my most recent communication, I do not want to cause panic, however, I must prioritize the interests of our students and staff.

For up-to-date information, visit www.cheltenham.org/coronavirus.

As this is a fluid situation, we will keep the lines of communication open and reach out again Friday, March 13 with an update.

Sincerely,

Dr. Wagner Marseille

\- Do any of you fine people have an idea how to deal with this 15' metal fence? Is there a place I can dispose of it... ?  
\- We'd also considered hiring a welder to come and make a gate in it so that at least the rest of the roof could be accessed, even if we leave the big fence in place (for future ability to sell it, I guess).

 I was tasked with a confined space job in one of your ancient storm water pipes. Deep motherfucking manhole, at least 40'. 

 She was a beauty, 100% brick, yall should be proud, the engineering company who hired my services said the pipe was built in the 1800s. 

Here's the area where she roughly lies under your feet. https://imgur.com/a/26pbufN

This pipe had been in service so long that the infiltration from the groundwater made some serious cave type stalactites.https://imgur.com/a/ENAwjFt  

and before you ask, yes I did take some. https://imgur.com/a/DXgpKUu

At some point the city or someone they hired decided to brick up the incoming pipe, and then sometime later the city or someone they hired decided that was a bad idea so they busted through their own brick wall to restore flow. https://imgur.com/a/5JszcN1

Interestingly, the incoming pipe on the 1900s era map the engineers had on hand was listed as 36"", it was the same gigantic diameter as the pipe I was tasked with inspecting so this was kind of a surprise for everyone. https://imgur.com/a/h4Prfgh

So pretty much I just inspected a section of pipe and discovered some things measured things and such. Anyway. 

What I really came here for is to ask about this:

“3.	The marriage license will issue on the third day following application and is valid for only sixty (60) days from the issue date that appears on the license. If the license is not used within the 60 day period, the marriage license must be returned and the application process must be repeated in its entirety and the fee re-paid.” 

So we do what is instructed get the license three days after. Can we just sign the license ourself and we are married?? Do we have to go back to the court house for a ceremony?? How do you “make it official” or use the marriage license?

I do my best to not park in crosswalks and to leave space for the fire hydrants. But I’ve gotten two corner clearance tickets for parking on 5th (Jackson/Moyamensing intersection), when you could literally turn a semi through there.

But the kicker is that all of these tickets were issued around 9:30 am (I don’t fall asleep until about 5 am), except today’s corner clearance ticket, which was was issued at 8 pm last night. Mind you, there are no parking/PPA signs in my area. So now they’re punishing us even more by ticketing at night because they know we have no other options but to park illegally.

I’m so defeated right now. I literally don’t know what to do. Between the construction fences and materials in the street, giant work trucks, and overgrown trees, there aren’t many legal spots to begin with after 5:30 pm. My biggest gripe is that there are 4 cars on my small street right now with inspections that expired 6-12 months ago and have flat tires. Ticket those people. Hell, tow them.

Two months ago, I signed my first ever lease on a studio apartment in Frankford and transferred the PECO Bill to my name shortly thereafter. 

The place is tiny, with electric baseboard heat, an electric oven and range, as well as a fridge and TV that i rarely turn on. Other than that, i charge my laptop and phone and turn on the lights for a few hours max, but thats about it when it comes to my electricity usage. 

My first PECO bill was ~$130, which was a lot more than I expected it to be. The next one was $170 and thats AFTER I started unplugging things when not in use and becoming very conscious how often I turn on the heat and for how long. 

I live alone and am rarely awake at home for more than a few hours a day. I am aware that my electric baseboard heat is a major factor when it come to the amount of electricity that I’m using, but I and everyone I’ve talked to still think that $170 is way too high of a bill for my situation.

I was gonna see my parents after 6 months during springbreak but that’s clearly not happening and  I’m having a hard time dealing with all of the situation on my own in a foreign country. 

After reading a tweet in which a girl explained an older couple was begging for someone to do the groceries for them so they don’t get exposed I realized that after all I’m 20 and very healthy and with a lot of free time for 3 weeks. Going straight to the point, I’m willing to grocery shop for anyone who believes they’re at risk and would like to avoid crowded places such as super markets. 

I unfortunately don’t have a car but I will just go inside the store and get all the food you need. I also understand this might sound like trying to scam people/stealing people’s money so I also don’t mind using my own money at first, or figuring some other way. If you know someone who might need help, or you are someone who needs help or just know how I can also help, please message me or let me know.

They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results. This poll will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

&gt;Dear Students,  
&gt;  
&gt;The University has made several difficult decisions in the past week in the interest of our community’s health and well-being. Included in these decisions was a notice to all students to immediately practice low-density medical standard social distancing.  
&gt;  
&gt;This included a clear mandate to cease all student group activities, on or off campus. No parties. No events.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do not jeopardize your health or that of your fellow classmates. Any failure to follow medical precautions exposes our police and medical first responders to unnecessary risk that can flood the emergency response system in the middle of a global health crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;**To that end, any student, student organization, or group of students found to be congregating on campus, or off campus, will face immediate intervention by Penn Police. Students and organizations violating this directive may face additional consequences, including referrals to the Office of Student Conduct.**  
&gt;  
&gt;This is an unprecedented situation, for our campus and the world. Please join us in ensuring that the health and safety of this community remains our top priority. Do not risk your health or your academic standing with poor decision making at this critical time.

I've lived in several cities large and small on the East coast so I get rudeness but the straight level of selfishness and ignorance today really makes Phillys stand out in this category. Just today alone,

* In the home depot parking lot on Christopher Colombus blvd some guy and his wife were blocking 3 parking spaces while in the middle of a lane loading their car. Just pull into a parking spot instead of blocking the lane and the empty spots.
* Some guy and girl both around 18 were walking down the sidewalk towards me. I heard the guy loudly say, ""Yea I've been feeling kind of sick the last 5 days"" in a joking way and he coughed right in my face. Literally right in my face. Him and the girl were black, (i'm white) I say this because another black guy was walking like 8 feet in front of me and he didn't cough in his face but apparently my face looked like an excellent target. Not necessarily saying it was race provoked but it just seemed very convenient.
* Some guy I was driving behind threw a whole grocery bag of trash out his window while we were driving around 10mph and the bag nearly hit some girl riding her bike. The person literally didn't care enough to make sure there was nobody on the sidewalk where he was throwing the bag.
* A group of guys driving ATVs were weaving through cars stopped at a red light. I happened to be on the opposite street stopped at a red light and saw 2 different ATV riders kick cars as they were weaving through.

My husband will be commuting to McGuire AFB \~3 days per week. He says he does not mind a long commute and would rather have the convenience of the city. Obviously minimizing his commute would be great. This is good news for me, however. I will be going back to school at either Temple or Drexel (or maybe Rutgers, if we decide to live in Jersey). 

We would love to buy if it is realistic to do that in a nice, safe neighborhood for \~250000 or less. We were thinking Fishtown, but it looks like 250K might be pushing the budget in that area. Port Richmond is cheaper, but not as nice from everything we have seen online. 

We are also considering south philly, but that would be a significantly longer commute for my husband. 

I guess I would just love to hear some local opinions on the above neighborhoods, and if there are any areas we should consider that are not even on our radar. Thank you so much for any insight!",philadelphia,Moving to Philly - Neighborhood recommendations?

I’m really excited about the job but nervous about commuting to both locations. I would be moving from out of the area, so I’m not very familiar with the various neighborhoods/suburbs in Philly.

I’ve been reading through this sub and talking with friends somewhat more familiar with the area. So far, it seems like neighborhoods along the main line (e.g., Ardmore, Bryn Mawr) would be my best bet. I’ve had a hard time getting a sense of the real door to door commute for these areas, though, and am also concerned about housing cost along the main line. I was also encouraged to look into Media, which seems like a great spot for getting into Univeristy City via transit, but maybe less great for driving to KOP. Google says it should be a 45 minute drive during a.m. rush hour, but also provides a range that stretches up over an hour.

So, how nuts am I to sign on for a job where some days I’m in University City and other days I’m all the way across town in King of Prussia? Will this kill my quality of life? I’m happy to commute via public transit or drive, whatever is quicker/easier. What neighborhoods could make this commute more reasonable, and what door to door times might I be looking at? Housing budget ideally sub 400k, no kids so school district not an issue for the foreseeable future.

I currently live in Center City and might get a job offer around there, but the job starts pretty early, like at 5AM, meaning I’d be traveling at 3-4AM. I know there’s a late night bus that can take me from CC to Frankford, but there’s no transportation up to Oxford Circle until it hits 5AM, which is too late. This would be around a 30 min walk as a small bodied female. Would you advise against this?

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund.

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.).

If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see.

I know many, if not most people consider us lesser people but we are people none-the-less; and given our pasts and propensity for heart and lung problems related to said pasts, we are particularly high risk. Even ignoring those factors, these are THOUSANDS of people riding public transit every day that are more likely than an average person to be accidental Typhoid Mary disease vectors.

I've got a week or two's worth of it here, but I have a feeling this quarantine will last more than a week, and restrictions will only get stricter. So I went looking. 

I tried the several grocery stores in South Philly and Center City but found nothing. I had to drive to West Chester on Monday to pack up my office so I could work from home for a while, and I found nothing at any grocery store along my way home. I figured maybe I could place an order on Amazon if I needed to, but I was legitimately starting to panic a bit. 

Then I stopped in a small store on a hunch. I walked into a corner pharmacy (Bertolino's Pharmacy, at 12th &amp; Dickinson), and sure enough they were ""fully"" stocked. It's a small store, so they didn't have a ton, but the whole designated toilet paper area of the shelf was stocked. I bought 2 packs of 4 rolls each — just enough to not worry, while leaving the rest for anyone else who might need it. 

So if you need TP or other items that are in short supply, check your local corner store. They're the locally owned businesses who need us as customers the most right now anyway! (Honestly I should've checked there first for this reason, but I didn't think of it.) 

Good luck out there. Stay safe, stay healthy, and stay wiped!",philadelphia,Toilet Paper

Businesses started closing at the beginning of the week but here in Lancaster as of 8pm tonight they're closing even more businesses.

So, come 2 or 3 weeks... will they be shutting down gas stations? Will grocery stores close? Has it gone to that extent in other countries? Is that even allowed for them to close stuff like that? 

I work in healthcare so come a month from now when PA is at peak infection (my nurse manager today told me that her conference this AM talked about peak cases will be in 2-3 weeks and this is essentially calm before the storm) my ass will still have to go to work, just thinking if gas stations closed and my car is empty I wouldn't be able to go anywhere obviously. Just want to know if that's even possible or legal or in the cards.

I wish these topics would be nationally publicized because I know I'm not the only one thinking about this. Luckily enough I am not the type to grab a bunch of buckets and go fill them up at gas stations to stash just in case.... but some people really are doing that. Same with groceries. 

Is this something that should be thought about? Are we facing a serious enough lockdown IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS that could legitimately close gas stations, grocery stores, etc. Idk if China and Italy did that I havent really seen that talked about so please share what you've read/know below.

4347,Averagejoe1982,1584712928,flvigy,Serious :snoo:,"You call 311 or 215-686-8686 for the city of Philadelphia. 
How that process works is that they take down the following information:


The kind of business you are reporting. (Ex. Retail - furniture store.)
The address.
The hours of operation.
And you can give your name and email or you can remain anonymous. 
They will give you a confirmation number that you can track online at phila.gov and look for the button to track a claim.


At this time, they do not know specifics on how the procedure will carry through - the operator just takes down the information and passes it off to License and Inspection where it will be followed through on their end.


Outside Philadelphia:
You have to contact the county's department of health.
For example: Bucks county is 215-345-3318
You call and you tell the operator you are reporting a non-essential business that is still operating. They will ask for the name of the business and what township it is located. They will ask you for your name and telephone number to be reached at.
The operator will then tell you that an agent in the health department will return your call. They do not share your name or telephone number on the report. It is just for the agent to call you back. Takes about five minutes or so for an agent to call back.

Agent calls you back, they ask for the company in question, their name and location.
For example,  I gave them the name of a new furniture store opening up in Warminster. (If you've been following this group for the past week - yup, still me. Still fighting)
So, there have been changes since the governor's speech. Replace non-essential with life sustaining. 
Yes, furniture stores fall under NOT life sustaining but due to it only being open to the workers and contractors preparing for its grand opening - it falls in a loop hole that the state, nor county can enforce since it is ""technically not operating to the public as a fully functioning retail store."" ....""And is subject to the owner's decision to close or remain open.""


So for me - I'm fucked. And since I already took the day off after telling my boss, who chuckled on the phone, the reason why I was calling out. I'm not going in on principal. 


But for you - the agent at the Bucks County department of health will do one of two things - send out an official to mandate the closure and issue a fine for first offence. (Starting Monday by the way ,so those bastards can still make you work today and the weekend)Or, if they fall in that same loop hole as I did then: If you feel your health or well-being is in jeopardy you can call the Bucks county consumer protection at 1800-942-2669.


So, good luck. Be safe. And if you are fortunate enough to take some time off without penalty - please do so. And for those of you that have to go to work due to a loop hole - I feel for you.
And while I'm on my soap box:

I live alone and I’m self quarantined. Not feeling great, low fever &amp; sore throat, but not panicked, treating it like the flu, keeping my contact with others to almost nothing, no-contact delivery for groceries and necessities. Today the building announced deliveries will no longer be allowed to be left at resident’s doors. They’re setting up a delivery table in the lobby  - 1 table, and hundreds of us live here - and we’re to go downstairs and look for our stuff and pick it up. When I wrote to say how unsafe I thought this was, I got a letter saying, sorry you’re inconvenienced (Not. The. Point) but we don’t want delivery workers in the building any more. I do get that as an issue, but they’re eliminating no contact delivery as an option when it’s what we’re advised to do. How is it safer to crowd all our bags together, let the enclosed space elevators become frequently crammed, have us congregating around 1 table, hoping nobody sneezes or coughs all over their stuff or each other? This forces me into the human contact I am purposefully avoiding - I’m sick and it may have nothing to do with covid 19 but if it does, I can’t deal with the smallest possibility that I could infect somebody else.

### What to Know

* A  carjacked SUV ditched under I-95 is believed to have been used in a  robbery spree targeting people in South Philadelphia Tuesday night.
* At least six people were robbed by masked men in about 90 minutes, Philadelphia police say.
* Police hope to capture the trio of thieves before they strike again.

&amp;#x200B;

 Over a 90-minute period, a trio of men robbed at least six people at  gunpoint in South Philadelphia, likely using a carjacked SUV, and police  want to track them down before they strike again.

“We’re looking at serial criminals, serial robbers that committed a  series of crimes… mainly in South Philadelphia,” Philadelphia Chief  Inspector Scott Small said.

The apparent robbery spree took place east of Broad Street between  South Street and Oregon Avenue from 10:30 p.m. Tuesday to midnight.

 “Most, or all, of these six robberies they described three males,  wearing all dark clothing with bandanas covering their faces,” Small  said. “One, two or all three were armed with a gun.”

The victims were all outside on the sidewalk when they were robbed,  Small said. At least one was hospitalized after being pistol-whipped to  the head.

 Investigators didn't reveal exact locations of each robbery. However,  a victim told NBC10 he was attacked by three people at 17th and Johnson  streets. He said his phone, wallet and backpack were taken.

After some of the robberies, the men appeared to get in a dark-colored SUV, possibly a Nissan Rogue, Small said.

Early Wednesday, police found a Rogue parked under Interstate 95 near  Front and Dickinson streets that had been stolen in a carjacking late  Saturday night just a few blocks away. The license plate on the SUV was  never changed and matched with the Tuesday night spree, investigators  said.",philadelphia,"Trio of Masked Armed Men Rob at Least 6 People in 90 Minutes in South Philly, Police Say"

4689,honest_resume,1585081857,focjmy,Nan,"Checked with the mods before making this post, and hope this can be a helpful resource in addition to other pinned resources on this topic. Please not that I am not a legal expert of any sort, but my understanding of PA's legal definition of self-employment, as detailed here, helped me to prove that I was eligible for unemployment benefits during a really difficult time when I needed that financial assistance. The layoffs that people are facing now are cutting them off from essential wages, so I hope that this help you get the financial assistance you need if this applies to you.

So, many people think that just because their work contract with their employer listed them as an independent contractor or self-employed that this translates to the PA Unemployment restriction on self-employed work. In a lot of cases it does not, and despite what your contract says you are still 100% eligible for unemployment benefits.

**Where do you start?** The best place to start is making sure you meet the **financial eligibility** criteria for unemployment benefits.

* You need to have [18 credit weeks](https://www.uc.pa.gov/faq/Employer/Pages/Credit-Weeks.aspx) (any calendar week Sunday - Saturday in which you made at least $116) that occurred within your [base year](https://www.uc.pa.gov/unemployment-benefits/Am-I-Eligible/financial-eligibility/Pages/Financial-eligibility.aspx#by).

Okay, you're financially eligible. **Now what?**   
Now you need to determine if your work meets the the [legal definition of self-employment](https://www.uc.pa.gov/unemployment-benefits/Am-I-Eligible/benefit-eligibility/Pages/Self-Employment.aspx) in PA.

For your work to be considered self-employment, it must meet **two criteria**:

1.  The individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of his/her services, both under his/her contract of hire and in fact.  
2.  As to such services, the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. 

**So what does that all mean? And how do I prove it?**

* **Work that is free from control or direction** essentially means that the your work performance and delivery of services to your employer is free from conditions set by your employer. Examples of this are: you determine where you work, you use programs and applications of your choice, you use your choice of equipment, you determine the procedure by which you work gets completed. 

At the time that I sought unemployment compensation, I was very worried about my work being found eligible since I was listed as an independent contractor who would be filing my wages as self-employed. Despite the title listed on my contract with my employer, my work was not free from control. I was told that I **had to be at my employer's place of business** when performing work or that I **had to be present on a business messaging app** when working from home, I did not have a choice in the equipment I could use when I worked on their **designated work laptop**, I did not have free choice in what programs and applications I could use when they told me which **applications I was required to use**, and the fact that I went through **weeks of training before my employment began** certainly did not mean that I had control or choice over the procedures defining my work performance. 

You can prove most of these with copies of the contract you signed that spell out the terms of your employment, as well as a copy of the Employee Handbook. Any messages you have between you and your supervisor or employer where he or she explicitly tells you how you have to do something is also proof of this. 

* **Being engaged in an independently established occupation or profession** can be a tricky stipulation to untangle, but it basically means that you determine what the work is that you are doing. Example: your employer hires you as a freelance graphic designer to perform services that he/she outlines (logos, business cards, website design) -- this is **NOT** an independently established trade because you are being contracted to perform a predetermined role. Now a different example: you are unicycle performance analyst who reaches out to unicyclists to see if they want to contract you to analyze their performance metrics and...other metrics that pertain to unicycling. In this case, this is a highly specialized trade whose role **YOU** have defined. This is your independently established trade.

When I argued this point for proving that my work was not self-employed, I focused on the fact that I was **trained to perform a specific, predetermined role**; that there were **other people fulfilling the same role** at the company; and that the dynamic of my work was not my employer contracting me to perform my individual services but my **being contracted to perform their services**.

&amp;#x200B;

When I argued both of these points, my work was found to not meet the criteria for self-employment and I was found to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Now, even if you take all of these steps and are found to be eligible for unemployment benefits, your former employer might still appeal the decision and then you'll have to proceed to a [UC hearing](https://www.uc.pa.gov/appeals/Pages/Appealing-a-UC-Service-Center-Determination-to-a-UC-Referee.aspx). In my case, my employer never saw me challenging the definition of my work to this extent so they never even submitted requested documents of proof when asked by the UC office. Although you might proceed to a hearing, this still speaks volumes of the importance of understanding the legal interpretation of your work and putting in the effort to supply proof and prove your point.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope that this is helpful to anyone who has been feeling defeated and thinking that they cannot get unemployment benefits. Again, I am not a legal expert, this is just my understanding of PA's legal definition for self-employment, it helped me get me my benefits and I hope it will help you too.",philadelphia,"To those recently laid off: You CAN file for unemployment even if you were ""freelance"" or ""self-employed."""

4699,melt_into_sound,1585090044,foez9e,Nan,"These are strange times indeed.  Look out for your neighbors and for those who might be in need always.

But this post is more literal.  Most everyone not working an essential job is stuck home, as are all the school age children.  And one of the few legal ways to be not home is going out for a walk.  This means there are a lot of pedestrians and a lot of parked cars around the neighborhoods.  So if you're driving around, please literally watch out for others.

There's probably not a single driver in Philly who doesn't slide through 4 way stops sometimes.  But there are a lot more people walking around  at all times of the day now, so please stop and pay attention.  Look both ways -- the car cross traffic might only come from your right but pedestrians are just as likely to come from your left.  If you're coming up on an intersection crowded with parked cars or trucks take an extra second to stop and look and make sure there is no one standing behind those vehicles waiting to cross.  And if you do see them, stop.  Don't say ""sorry!"" as you hit the gas and continue rolling through.  You're not sorry.. if you were sorry you'd have been on the brakes like you should have in the first place.

We're all hiding out and social distancing to keep the hospitals from being overwhelmed.  Don't put someone in the hospital (or worse yet the morgue) due to your driving negligence.  Slow down, pay attention, and everyone stay safe out there.",philadelphia,Watch out for each other please

My girlfriend's car was stolen last night. She's been running food deliveries with the local pizza shop, since we were both laid off. She went up to a house to make a delivery, then someone ran up and drove off in her car. Luckily, she is safe and not hurt. This occurred around 47th st and Windsor Ave last night just before 10pm.

Valley Forge Response to Coronavirus

Valley Forge National Historical Park is currently closed. This closure includes all park roads, parking lots, trails and open spaces. We have made this difficult decision in order to better protect visitors, park employees and the resources that make this place special. Vehicles parked illegally will be ticketed. Vehicles that block emergency vehicle access (such as on roads or in front of gates) will be towed, as they present a serious safety hazard.

I hope everyone is doing well right now. 

I am not from Philly, but planned on moving soon (end May) for a new job. I was about to sign a lease, but then things really hit with the virus. I don't really know when I will now start the job at this time, but don't want to lose the apartment, but also would hate to sign something and be locked in and pay when I am not even there. I also would like to stay away from the city until this settles down. 

I can't imagine the market is that hot with people looking to move right now.  Has there been any rules/procedures set in regards to landlords/apartments/leases that you are aware of?

§ 459-501. Killing dogs; dogs as nuisances

(a) Legal to kill certain dogs.--Any person may kill any dog which he sees in the act of pursuing or wounding or killing any domestic animal, wounding or killing other dogs, cats or household pets, or pursuing, wounding or attacking human beings, whether or not such a dog bears the license tag required by the provisions of this act. There shall be no liability on such persons in damages or otherwise for such killing.

So why is this important? Because your friendly dog off leash may get excited and want to run to someone or another dog to say hi. That person could pull a weapon and injure or kill your dog. Guess what? See that word *pursuing* ? 

It would be your word against his. Dog was off leash.  Law protects him.

So that would mean there's 3293-530=2763 people out spreading it.

I'm about to graduate medical school, matched into residency in Philadelphia and need to move from out of state in early June. Unfortunately because of current events I am unable to do any in-person tours and will have to sign a lease sight-unseen so I'm hoping I can get some local takes and advice.

 Looking for a quiet 1 bedroom, cat-friendly, with parking, &lt;$1400/month. I'm a runner and mostly looking around East Falls/Manayunk/Wissahickon because of the proximity to trails. I would prefer a private landlord, but I'm afraid of getting scammed since I can't tour in person. It is also harder to find available units because many aren't posted online until they're ""available now!"", and I don't want to put off finding housing until late May.

I applied and got approved for (what seems like) a lovely apartment in Alden Park on my timeline and budget. They've given virtual tours and answered my truly exhaustive line of questioning, but I've still heard and read very mixed reviews and am feeling uneasy about signing the lease this week. On the other hand, almost every complex I've looked at that has reviews has some truly terrible ones, so I'm not quite sure what to listen to. Out of curiosity I looked up my current complex, which has been mildly annoying at worst, and it similarly has tons of one-star reviews about how it will ruin your life. I don't want to discount real warnings though.

I’ll be starting a PhD program at Temple this fall and am trying to narrow my housing search down a bit. 

To begin with: maximum for rent I’d wanna pay is probably $1,400 (would prefer closer to $1,200 BUT); I have a young daughter and a fiancée, and so am looking for somewhere near a decent elementary school, probably not in the immediate vicinity of Temple campus; that being said, this isn’t veiled language for wanting to be in the whitest possible neighborhood - we don’t fit this demographic ourselves, and are young. 

We’re liking some places in West Philadelphia, and it seems like it could be a cool area - esp. In Penn Alexander catchment (correct me if I’m wrong). I wonder though, how inconvenient would a commute to Temple be from here (I’d like to utilize public transportation/walking/biking as much as possible for the first time in my life).

5141,ScottishCalvin,1585624414,fs5bwx,Nan,"Correct me if I'm wrong on the crux of this, but my understanding has been that a sizeable percentage of everyone is going to get the Corona at some point but we want to broaden that timeframe so as not to completely collapse the system over 2-3 weeks. Once enough people have it, 30% or thereabouts, herd immunity slowly kicks in and it becomes harder for it to spread so it dies faster.

But barely anyone in Philly has even had it. Handfuls of cases in a city of half a million. Given that it is a thing now, shouldn't the gameplan be to slowly work our way to that percentage over the course of a month or two? Or is the plan to completely shut the city down for a year, make sure nobody gets it at all, all on the hope that it also disappears at a national level?",philadelphia,"For the economic damage being caused, shouldn't we be having more cases to gain herd immunity?"

Been thinking about this recently, for context I'm from Allentown and I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to locations and culture, etc. I was wondering what you guys consider culturally Philly. I can really only speak for the Northern suburbs. The Lehigh Valley feels like a combination of NYC, Philly, and our own brooding culture here. However Philly feels more ""local"" to me than New York City does, despite not being that much more far away. 

I know tons of people who commute from the valley to places down in Philly, to the point where Montco and Buckco feel super localish. But the valley definitely has it's own culture that isn't entirely dominated by Philly. I see just as many Giants and Jets fans here as I do Eagles fans, and we have our own economic business centers with their own suburbs here. I (personally) do not really consider the Lehigh Valley ""culturally"" Philadelphia, despite being quite close. I kinda view it similar to a Baltimore Washington Situation. 

It's actually really cool because I only have to drive like 10 miles south before I begin to feel like I'm culturally in Philly. Typically around or a little south of Quakertown. Idk what do you guys think?",philadelphia,"What would you consider ""culturally Philly""??"

--------------------------------------



**Food Safety During The Coronavirus Pandemic**

In these crazy days, as we practice physical distancing and self-isolation, food safety is a topic that warrants a discussion. Here's what you need to know.
Here is the memo we got at work. We are a healthcare consulting company and are very close with local insurers and medical facilities. I hope this helps.



**Can I get infected from touching food or food packages?**


According to the CDC, USDA, and FDA, as of today, there are no indications that COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging. That said, the virus can survive for several hours to days on surfaces.



**How do I disinfect food and packages?**


Despite the low risk, you can take certain precautions:

* handle with disposable gloves

* dispose of external packaging when possible

* place package in a ""quarantine"" of a few days before handling

* wash plastic, glass, and cans with soap and water 

* as always, wash produce before use.

Again, these are not recommendations of federal health agencies, rather extra safety measures.



**What about takeaway and food delivery?**


The biggest risk by far is coming in contact with an individual who is symptomatic. Therefore, food delivery is preferred, because you will only meet one human - the delivery person. Leave them a nice tip too!


Another option is doing a drive-thru. Even if the establishment does not normally do drive-thru pickup, call and ask if they can bring your order out to you or your car.



**What happens if I eat food that was contaminated with coronavirus?**


There is no need to worry about this for several reasons:

* cooking food kills the virus.
 
* the coronavirus evolved to attack specific respiratory cells, not the digestive system

* stomach acids will most likely neuter the virus 

* even if they don't, the virus isn't able to infect the intestinal tract. However, the virus has been detected in stool samples. That's why washing hands after a visit to the lavatory is still important.




&gt;*To summarize, hot food is virtually risk free. if a person with coronavirus prepared your sandwich or salad,the chances you will contract the virus from the food is still miniscule.*",philadelphia,Facts About Food Safety &amp; CoViD: I hope this little bit of good news helps someone sleep better tonight.
5164,pianomanzano,1585667160,fsehtg,Question? :snoo_thoughtful:,"See title. Have heard anecdotally of someone who has tested positive but is asymptomatic and is continuing about their daily life (food shopping and whatnot). Don't know the person at all, but supposedly their family has it too and is in the hospital on ventilators. 

Again not sure of the veracity of this account, but it got me thinking - Are those who tested positive being monitored in any way? Feel like that's key to limiting exposure/transmission of the disease. Taiwan actively monitored even those who arrived from overseas (who were required to self-quarantine for 14 days) via tracking cell-phone locations via GPS and conducting checks at their homes, with hefty fines for those who violate those orders. Our health commissioner was on CNN yesterday morning stating that while we have a self-quarantine order for people who've recently traveled to NYC such an order is not at all enforceable, which further makes me think no tracking of anyone is being done. Any thoughts?",philadelphia,"How are people who test positive for COVID-19 at drive-thru testing sites (or any testing site for that matter) being tracked, if at all?"

5332,fichimonz,1585856484,ftszln,Nan,"All public health officials have long advised that people who are sick should wear a mask to limit infecting others.

More recently evidence has accumulated that people can spread Cornavirus even before they know they are sick. The Philadelphia health department now declares this as fact: https://twitter.com/PHLPublicHealth/status/1245112143160229889

Evidence has also been surfaced that any face and nose covering -- even a homemade mask made from a t-shirt -- is better than nothing. Evidence has also surfaced that masks also probably give some protection to the person wearing them. Furthermore, to help overcome shortages, masks can be reused by washing cloth masks in the laundry or by baking a surgical mask in the oven at 160 degrees for 30 minutes. (sources [1](https://medium.com/better-humans/whats-the-evidence-on-face-masks-5f3c27a18cc), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/), [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01428.x), [4](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/us-coronavirus-face-masks.html), [5](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1242894378441506816.html) )

So...given all this new knowledge isn't it obvious that we need everyone to be wearing face coverings when they are enclosed with other people, such on SEPTA or in grocery stores?

It seems crazy to me that we are bearing this tremendous burden of shutting down our city and not seeing friends and family -- and then I go to the super market and dozens of people are mixing in close proximity with no protection. Even if masks aren't 100% effective, if everyone is wearing a mask and it reduces spread in common areas by 75%, that is huge for getting the overall epidemic under control.

In order to get the outbreak under control and start opening up the city again, we need to get R0, the reproductive number for this virus, below 1. Without social distancing, R0 seems to be 3 or 4. If we undergo all the disruption of the shut down, but we end up only reducing R0 to something like 1.3, then despite the shut down the epidemic will still be getting worse and worse every day and there won't be a peak at all until most of us have been infected. But if we can get R0 all the way below 1, we can get it bottled up in a month or two. Thus, it is imperative we do every possible to make sure we err on the side of getting R0 as low as we humanly can.

Wouldn't we feel really, really stupid if a month from now we find the shut-down has only reduced R0 to 1.3 and there are actually more cases than ever -- but that if we had just required everyone to wear a mask at the super market the shutdown could have been almost over?

Let's not be that stupid. Mayor Kenney, Dr Farley, CEO's of relevant companies and agencies, /u/phlpublichealth, please require masks in grocery stores and on SEPTA!",philadelphia,"When will Philadelphia require people to wear masks in crowded areas (on SEPTA, in Grocery stores, etc.)?"

 - **Smiley.** He was a close to middle aged man that would just stand on street corners smiling (always smiling) and staring into oblivion. He had short dark hair and always wore a baggy black bomber jacket, even in the summer. Never really saw him do anything else apart from talking to himself occasionally. Always staring, always smiling.

 - **Sandwich Lady.** She was an elderly babushka-wearing woman who would pace the streets proclaiming something indecipherable, that I always understood as ""Got any SANDWICHES?!"". Truly a sad case, though she seemed to be in her element. She usually hung out around Chestnut/Broad and I saw her get out at the tasker/morris broad st stop a couple times.

 - **The Riddle Man.** Okay this guy was definitely a con artist but he was entertaining. Lanky middle aged black dude that called himself the riddle man. He'd tell you a riddle as a way to justify asking you for money. He had a lot of them and was actually quite friendly and charismatic, could have had a great career somewhere if he wasn't on the streets. The main one I remember was: What's long, black, and in between 2 nuts?...... Sansom street! I lost faith in him after he tried pulling a couple tall tales on me for sympathy money, like needing money for the 2.99 cheesesteak special at Little Pete's. Bitch, a cheesesteak isn't that cheap there. Regardless of his shenanigans, my stupid college friends and I got a lot of entertainment from him.

You’re sitting at home either working, applying for unemployment, or pondering your next GoPuff order (yes, get the ice cream). You’ve been watching Fluffy way more than normal. You wonder if you should finally get that bump looked at that’s been there for four years. Did Fluffy just limp a tiny bit on that front paw? No, she looks normal. But maybe she did limp once! Does her breath smell a tiny bit worse than it did last month? Did she just cough a single time after scarfing down her Kibbles and Bits? Maybe it’s time to get Fluffy’s anal glands done, because she’s been scooting her entire life. IS FLUFFY OKAY??

These thoughts are normal, but I ask you to please not act on them. If you are concerned, call your regular veterinarian and make an appointment. Non-emergent things are flooding the local animal ER’s, which are already understaffed and overworked, and it’s taking attention and time away from critical emergencies. If it’s something that’s been going on for weeks or months and is not getting significantly worse, it can wait.  Your regular veterinarian can also advise you when it comes to vaccines and flea/tick/heartworm prevention, often via telephone (and many emergency rooms don’t carry these products!). 

That being said, here’s a list of things that *should* be seen:

- Toxin/poison ingestion, including grapes, raisins, chocolate, rodenticide, lillies, human medication, overdoses of pet medication, illicit drugs, etc. PLEASE call Pet Poison control or ASPCA poison control ON YOUR WAY TO THE ER
- Trouble breathing, blue/purple gums, choking
- Bleeding that will not stop even after pressure is applied for 5 minutes (time it; it’s longer than you think)
- Intractable vomiting/retching, particularly in large breed dogs
- Inability to urinate, especially male cats
- Broken bones and dog fights resulting in open wounds
- Seizures or other neurological signs (falling over, dragging legs)
- Collapse, loss of consciousness 
- Heat stroke
- Uncontrolled pain (please DO NOT give anything over the counter that has not been prescribed to your pet)

The above are true emergencies. Most other things can wait, but if you’re unsure, call either your local vet or your closest ER and they can often recommend whether you be seen or not. If you do need to be seen, please understand that there will likely be a long wait and you will not be permitted to enter into the hospital, no matter how anxious Fluffy is without you (much of our PPE is being conserved for use in human facilities, and we are doing our best to protect ourselves and you). 

Finally, please STAY HOME. In many states veterinarians have received letters asking for volunteers if physicians become overwhelmed. Veterinarians perform a rectal exam on all patients, and take every temperature rectally. You DO NOT want a veterinarian caring for you!

5484,VanDammeJamBand,1586065480,fv8skp,Nan,"So, like many of you I’m sure, I’m getting a little itchy being inside pretty much all day. My girlfriend and I (don’t worry, we live together) wanted to get out, so we decided to check out Valley Forge National Park. After a quick google check, a PA parks website said that no personnel would be working in any parks, but that trails and such would be open. So we drove the 30 minutes up from South Philly to see that every parking lot, every decent parking shoulder etc all was blocked off. There was definitely a vibe that we weren’t supposed to be on the grounds, although we did see a handful of people walking or biking the paths. We ended up just going back home very disappointed.  

Does anyone have any insight on the legality of going to public parks right now? It was mostly empty so we would definitely be able to walk around there without coming even nearly close contact with anyone else. And if it’s definitely a no-go, do you have any other advice for us, places to go where we can safely check out some nature?",philadelphia,Any advice for a “social distance safe” nature walk?

5547,saco_palm,1586126164,fvmyad,Question? :snoo_thoughtful:,"The office is closed until further notice :) On the website it says the Philly Parking Violations are only ticketing for *Safety Violations* and on the list of examples, there is nothing even remotely close to inspection/registration issues. From what I can deduce, I believe they put an extension on registration and/or inspection.

From the site directly:

""The safety violations that will continue to be enforced include: 

* Zones reserved for people with disabilities without displayed credentials;
* Fire hydrant;
* No stopping in a bus zone or close to a corner;
* Blocking a wheelchair accessible curb cut;
* Loading zones –The truck loading zones restricted from 6 am to 10 am on Chestnut and Walnut will not be enforced, all other loading zones will be enforced per the instructions on the signs. ""

Why am I getting ticketed for something I can't fix? Why can't I talk to anyone about this? And why are we issuing tickets for something that has had an **extension put on it???**

I'm extremely frustrated and don't understand. If I pay this ticket, who's to say I won't receive another one?

I tried calling 311 to possibly get connected to someone I can speak to and the woman couldnt hear me for some reason (I was using my airpods and had literally just gotten off of another phone call where they had worked perfectly fine when I called them, and she hung up on me. When I tried calling back, I was sent to voicemail.

I should add:

I was not parked illegally. My inspection sticker expired in February, and I had just moved here in January. Granted, obviously I had the entire month of February to get it done and update my registration. I should have done it then. But now that I am unable to, why should I get ticketed for this in this situation? I'm not driving the vehicle. It's been parked there.

EDIT: I can't even contest or pay the ticket because the ticket number isn't registered on the website. What the fuck?",philadelphia,Received parking violation ticket for expired inspection sticker? During a pandemic?

I've already printed three here as a backup.

On the tech side: It's a roughly 2 hour print, PLA, no supports. I've been using a Prusa MK3 with Prusament and Hero3D filament. The filter part we're attaching to has a plastic 22mm OD. I've prepared STLs with 22.1mm, 22.2mm, and 22.3mm openings. Unfortunately, I don't have that piece in person so I can't do any fit tests. Another reason why it would be helpful to be local.

I imagine I’m not alone among the car drivers among us, in having occasionally parked my car, and then--the next time I needed it (sometimes even the very next morning)--not remembered where I parked it.  I recently discovered a super useful feature on my iPhone, and though I may be one of the last people to know about it, wanted to share it in case others were also unaware.  Once I park my car, I can launch Siri, and simply say ""Remember where I parked my car.""  It'll think for a few seconds, and will then say, ""Okay, I'll remember that you parked at 1234 Any St. (or wherever).""  Then, when I want to be reminded of where my car is, I simply launch Siri, and say, ""Where did I park my car?""  And she'll tell me.  It seems that it will continue to remember the location until the next time you ask her to remember it, as I've asked her to remind me of where I parked, and then asked again a bit later, and she still remembers.

I assume, but don’t know for sure, that there’s a similar feature on Android phones.
