2,2,The___Great,1577805806,ei46lr,Nan,"I'm visiting your fine state and have been yelled at twice for not wearing shoes. 
I'm staying in a hotel (that does not change sheets between guests) and when running down to the lobby to grab a cup coffee to bring back to my room I've been yelled at. The hotel staff tells me I have to wear shoes, unless I'm in the water of the pool, that it's a law and they get citations for barefoot guests.

This seems crazy to me. Isn't the point of hotels to feel like home? 

Is this an actual law?

I just want to know before I leave a review for this hotel (It's gonna be one star anyway, the staff are bi-lingual and assume their guests arent. I don't appreciate being talked about, especially when I'm present and not quite fluent enough to respond)",illinois,shoe law?

We have drivers licenses from Ontario but will need to obtain licenses here in Chicago. (We don't own vehicles but may wish to rent a car here and there.) What is the process for this? Is testing required for us as Canadians, or can we ""swap out"" our Ontario licenses for Illinois licenses? Where do we go for this? What documents should we bring, as we aren't American citizens?

The company has taken the stance that, since not everyone is able to work from home, NO ONE is allowed to work from home - even people whose work can easily be done remotely (and frankly already has often BEEN done remotely). Most people in my office can do their work remotely. But if we don‚Äôt want to work during this shelter in place period, we either have to use sick time, vacation time, or unpaid time.

First, the pension funds. We've seen a 30% drop in equity values, and that's just the beginning. It's very likely ""Investment grade"" corporate bonds will see many defaults as well. The drop in asset values will result in even more severe underfunding for state pensions. As a result, the state will need to contribute more to ensure pensions are paid in full.

At the same time, state sales and income tax revenue is going to decline significantly as people are stuck at home, unable to work, and retail stores that people spend at are closed.

My guess is Illinois defaults within 10-20 years. The funded % of the pensions will continue to decline, and the size of deficits and interest on debt will continue to rise, until the state becomes unable to balance bond interest payments, pension liabilities, and overall spending. Taxes will likely go up, but that will only exacerbate the problem by weakening the state economy and accelerating the exodus.",illinois,Illinois defaulting on debt seems inevitable now
