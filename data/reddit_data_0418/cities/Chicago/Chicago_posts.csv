Ideas: 
1.refuse/reduce/reuse/ recycle designs
2. basic details on what plastics are recycable in that area. 
3. quotes from kids in the CPS garden talking about food connections. 
4. In season/ local produce details
5. Maps of community gardens in the area 

For it to be effective- I like the idea of a group that makes sure info graphics are up to date and damaged imagery to be replaced/ maintained.

I would like to thank (and gratefully blame) you all and your wonderful city for the inch i‚Äôm about to add to my waistline during my stay in Chicago. I am a native Texan (living in Utah now) and have always just assumed that Texas has everyone beat when it comes to food. The food in Texas is something all Texans very arrogantly boast about. Now that i‚Äôve spent some time in The Windy City and have tasted what i‚Äôve tasted, I would like to share my thoughts with you:

Portillo‚Äôs has incredible Italian beef and hotdogs, but guess what? Their burgers are better than Whataburger.

I‚Äôve discovered that Chicago‚Äôs Mexican food is just as good as what you‚Äôll find in Texas, if you know where to look. Seriously.

The pizza... Deep dish, pan pizza... The only reason New Yorkers are so sour with their ‚Äúit‚Äôs not real pizza‚Äù argument is because you can find good ‚ÄúNew York-style‚Äù pizza just about anywhere in the US. No one can adequately copy Chicago‚Äôs incredible deep dish. (My favorite so far is Pequod‚Äôs, which isn‚Äôt exactly deep-dish, but still.)

Thanks!",chicago,Chicago has better food than Texas. You‚Äôre welcome.‚ù§Ô∏è

I've been riding the CTA a long while, and one transit trick I do occasionally on crowded days is to take a subway the opposite direction, to catch a train, earlier in its run, going in my preferred direction, that has **seats**.

Now that train trackers are more accurate, it'd be interesting if an app could compute when two trains are going to ""connect"" in a station -- i.e., knowing that a southbound train will meet a northbound train (within, say, 1-2 minutes, maybe that's user-configurable) at Roosevelt, or Jackson, or Morse, etc., etc.

I currently eyeball it flipping back and forth between tracker directions, but it'd be a unique feature currently not in an app.  An app developer could probably make a few dollars from the idea ...

I would appreciate your help on the following item I have: 

I may be taking a job in the loop with a finance company that will take me from Los Angeles to Chicago. I haven't lived in Chicago in almost 10 years and then, it was in a southern suburb, I was single and no kids. I know winter is rough, and I must be crazy leaving the over priced chaos of southern California... but, money talks!

fast forward 10 years....Now- I am married with 2 kids.  Who are both under 4. 

I could use some assistance with the following:

What good family neighborhoods with single detached family homes, great schools and relatively close to the various train/CTA lines to allow me to commute into the city would you suggest? Safety of the area is good, too. This job travels about 25%/ month.

I did live in Aurora years ago, and I will not move to Aurora or Naperville- period. I want a town that has character. Aurora and Naperville were just boring and closed minded. (sorry if you feel differently)

Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,
Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;
Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders:

They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys.
And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again.
And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger.
And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them: 
Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.
Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities;
Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness, 
Bareheaded,
Shoveling,
Wrecking,
Planning,
Building, breaking, rebuilding,
Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth,
Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs,
Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle,
Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse,
and under his ribs the heart of the people, 
Laughing!

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

757,757,bzmaker,1578843517,enov69,Ask CHI," 

moving to Chicago from NYC for a new job. I'm 47 but very young in most regards. My new position near N. Western Ave &amp; W. Chicago Ave. Ukraine Village?? It seems like Oak Park has more of what I want in the way of walkability to food markets and hopefully some good gyms. I see that Evanston is popular. Walkability is king to daily life stuff. However I do love to inline skate and being near the bike trails next to the lake looks very appealing too. And I'm painfully single so I'd like to find good odds on meeting a woman in my age range(40's). I'd like to pay no more than 1650 for rent

Any insight will be appreciated. thx",chicago,new guy in town..

764,764,eenixxx,1578847407,enppq0,Nan,"So it really sucks not to see the orange and blue in these NFL playoffs.

But, then again, part of me feels this is poetic justice because I don't think the Chicago press or fandom did enough to denounce the firing of Cody Parkey. I feel this is karma coming back to bite this organization in the keister.

I mean, that last kick was partially blocked. It wasn't a real double-doink.

And they have a guy now who can't even doink. You had a doinker in Chicago and fired him and replaced him with a guy who can't doink. Doinking is fun, especially when you can do it three times in one afternoon and still win a football game.

What irks me is that Parkey's own teammates were so humane that it was inspirational. 

Then Bears' management follows that kindness up with an abrupt firing, so that the guy can't even get a job in the NFL any more (and he was, if I am not mistaken, a pro-bowler once upon a time). Their excuse that he was grandstanding on TV doesn't fly with me. He's a young guy, forgive him for wanting his mom to see him on a TV talk show.

So there's my two-cents that I felt compelled to throw in there after watching a playoff game.

If they fired Parkey, why don't they fire the guys who did such miserable job of play-calling this year on the coaching staff? There's no goofy word (like doink) for their errors, but there should be.",chicago,Cody's revenge

They're great means or transportation for a big city, but the way these companies do things, they get literred all over the place, and on top of that you pay a rental fee every time you ride one. That adds up fast.

I'd rather see us invest in some kind of safe storage/parking throughout the city where we can park our own small engine/electric vehicles without worrying about them being instantly stolen.

I think a lot of people would buy their own electric bikes or scooters if it was safer to park them somewhere and not have to lug them around with them.",chicago,I wish we had places to park small engine vehicles like gopeds and scooters

781,781,mav89,1578857264,ens0ws,Nan,"Just to summarize my situation right now:   
- Early 30's, currently live in Canada  
- Remote (work-from-home) job       
- I have a Visa and can work in either country (in case anyone was curious)  
- Salary about $45k USD      
- Single, no children     

My eventual goal down the road is to:   
- Live downtown or close to in a neighborhood I like (either on long-term rent or purchase)   
- Meet new people     
- Not need a vehicle    
      
 
Given that info, I think I have two small advantages despite my low pay ($3000/month after taxes if my math is right). One, I can work remote and am not locked into a certain area where I need to be near an office. The other, is I have a friend (from Michigan) who would like to tag along for a few months since they work uber and want a change of scenery. They would cover the bills (internet, food), and I will cover the rent. They're a bit disabled so can't work long hours, but it does give me an opportunity to room with someone who has a vehicle and can help with a few expenses, at least for a few months until they move back.  
  
Okay, so beyond that, **my questions to you people are:**
 
1) Would it be smart to seek a short-term rental using something like AirBnb even though it might cost a bit more? If so, how much do you think I should pay max since you guys know Chicago way better than I do in terms of food cos?  
  
2) Is AirBnb/Craigslist the best way of securing such a thing or are there any sites/resources you'd suggest? Is hiring an agent a bad idea to find something for me if nothing good comes up on AirBnb?   
  
3) If my goal is to explore neighborhoods, how far outside of downtown should I go? Yes my friend has a vehicle but I'd really like to get use to taking the subway and moving/exploring the city alone when they're not available. I guess another way of asking this is, given my pay and my desire to explore neighborhoods until I find one I'd like to live in long-term, which neighborhoods or suburbs would you recommend I explore?  
 
4) Is there any other advice or suggestions you can give? You can be brutally honest, tell me if I'm doing something right or if anything here sounds stupid.",chicago,"Wanted your advice on whether I'm going about this right. Would moving to Chi, in the burbs, on a short-term rental while exploring neighborhoods for a long-term deal a good idea?"

I‚Äôve planned a family vacation to Chicago the week of Memorial Day. We booked an Airbnb near the Trader Joe‚Äôs by the Loop. (In the loop?on the loop?) that neighborhood was recommended by several friends who used to live there. 

We‚Äôre going to have 3 full days and plan to do sight seeing in the morning, I was thinking Millennium Park one day, the Navy Pier one day , and Field Museum the third day. We are going to be traveling with a 2.5 year old and a 6 month old. Any other recommendations for things to do? We‚Äôre not planning to rent a car and will rely on public transit. 

I‚Äôm also looking for recommendations for family friendly restaurants. My son is a pretty good eater. We will pick up some groceries for breakfast in the Airbnb.

The next round was a Moscow and a water for my girlfriend, the middle-aged man throws a water bottled and begins to make my Moscow, without asking about the water.

I STILL agreed to this, gave him a 10, and he returns with $8. HE TIPPED HIMSELF. I almost laughed because I felt so bad, I gave another $1 to be cordial and stared him directly in the eyes.

Then she said oh gosh really, I thought it was a bit cheaper (Just to test the waters). He hands the Mug to another bartender, new guy starts making the drink and first guy, acting confused, goes and asks ""How much are Moscows usually?!"" The new bartender says oh yeah these, around here.... $14. I'm like B**** what kind of 20% inflation in 12 seconds s*** voodoo magic are you playing. The new tender POURS the ice with a tiny bit of squeezed lime on it, back into the ice bin when we stated what what did yo raise the price!? Leave it to say I left Play Chicago Kitchen The Club Mixtape Vol. 2 looking a** joint for the last time. I really liked the atmosphere though, the room looks cool RGB lit and has a simple layout. The security and bouncers were friendly. They let's us in free for the McGreggor Cowboy fight which was nice and obviously  short lived then immediately changed the video and sound over to music before watching any congratulatory speaking which looked money thirsty and people ohhed and ahhhed over that for a bit. They turned every screen into a still image and immediately obnoxiouslh loud music without a ease into it after our ears were in a *listening to talking and fighting action* mode. I'm not completely over the place, just the bartenders.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations.

Rather I mean huge increases in property taxes to pay for pensions. Emanuel's deeply unpopular property tax hikes resulted in just $500 million in revenue raised to fund pensions. As big as a number as that is, it's nowhere near enough to cover the billions that must be paid in the next several years. 

I commend Mayor Lightfoot on being creative with raising revenues, and I realize that she didn't create this mess. It's been a long time coming.

It was freezing out but I didn't feel like paying for an Uber or Lyft so waited a bit and walked to Lake Street to have a look at LED display at the bus stop; the LED display had a time of 18 minutes.  Temperature was dropping and with only 15% charge on my phone I called for a Lyft, but before the driver could get to me the cold snap killed my phone.  Then an Ashland bus just showed up so I got on and was able to restart my phone and cancel the Lyft.

The company I worked at was purchased while I was on medical leave, and a couple of months after returning to work I was layed off. Money had already been tight and that didn't help any. 

All of this is to provide background as to why I'm posting. i was evicted from my apartment on Monday, and have been staying at a Motel 6.  I start a new job next week, and family had told me they would help out to keep myself and my cat at the hotel until then. I'm not sure of the reasons but that has now fallen through. 

my dilemma is my cat I can most likely handle having to be homeless for a while, but there is no way I can take him with me. I've called all the shelters I can find locally, and none accept pets that are not service animals. I don't even want to think about having to take him to an animal shelter. The furball saved my life at least twice, and I don't want to reward that kind of love with the only options I have available.

I have reached out to everyone I know to see if they can house him for a bit, but am not having any luck at all.  

I have requests in to all the local housing assistance / financial aid programs, and have appointment scheduled with North Height services on Monday, but that leaves me getting booted from motel 6 today at 11. 

Any suggestions or advice are welcome. Hell, at this point even another human giving a kind word would be great.",chicago,"Recently evicted from apartment, soon to be homeless. Advice, suggestions, and kind words desperately needed!"

1461,1461,sandgroper1968,1579870149,et9zbg,Nan,"Sorry, there‚Äôs not much happening in R/Skokie so I thought I‚Äôd try in here...

We‚Äôve rented in A-ville for many years and are about to, ahem...~pull the trigger~ on a lovely house in Skokie. It‚Äôs on a quiet tree-lined street between Oakton and the yellow line with Crawford not too too far to the east. The area does have a lovely vibe to it but coming from Andersonville I know that just because an area looks nice and feels safe, doesn‚Äôt mean that shit doesn‚Äôt go down here.

I‚Äôve looked at some sites online regarding crime stats for Skokie and they‚Äôre just not consistent and some just don‚Äôt seem believable - mostly the sites where they want you to then pay them for more details...
One site had the area our potential new house is in ranked as the 9th most dangerous area of Skokie (out of 10) and that just doesn‚Äôt seem right to me.

I‚Äôve also been trying to find Skokie on the police scanner apps I use, but without any luck. Does anyone know if I can tune into that?

I‚Äôll be taking public transportation a couple of times a week and I‚Äôm curious about how safe the swift and the swift stations are. My guess is that the Howard station and the redline will probably be more of a safety concern. 

I‚Äôm also looking for recommendations if you‚Äôre familiar with the area, places to eat, things to do etc 

Thanks in advance!",chicago,Moving from Andersonville to Skokie soon and curious about crime stats in the area. Any Skokigians in here?

I get it, if you are working for a medical practice it is extra work to get approval, plan and schedule an observation, not to mention the potential uncomfortability for you or your patient of someone sitting and watching every minute detail of your interaction. But hey, tell me what hours work for you and I'll be there. I'll bring you coffee, and take you to lunch. I'll leave you a stellar review on yelp and every other platform you like! I just really need a more accurate picture of what its like to be you for a day, before I pump $100k's into my education. Thanks!

In light of some recommendations I may receive: 

Yes, I have reached out to 40-50 physicians/clinics/hospitals in Chicago, met with either silence or ""sorry we do not allow shadowing at our practice"" 

Yes, I do volunteer at a large hospital network, and have gained some clinical/patient experience through this opportunity, but this hospital network does not allow direct shadowing experiences and my interactions the physicians has been limited.

Yes, my undergrad institution has ample opportunities for ""current undergrads"".

1639,1639,wolverine4343,1580112876,eul2zk,Ask CHI,"My fianc√© is from Chicago, and she's interested in moving back there once we graduate from college next spring. I would love to as well, and am trying to learn a little bit about schools in the area, as I'll be a high school English teacher once I'm out of school. Specifically, I'm wanting to get a picture of how CPS would mandate my curriculum look and common core be applied. 

Utah applies the core standards, but they're really relaxed about it for the most part. For example, a lot of English departments around here choose overarching goals they see in the standards (e.g. ""critical thinking"" or ""effective communication"") rather than individually addressing each standard. I like this, as I have some of the same concerns with the core as the Chicago Teachers Union lists on their website, worrying that it will keep my curriculum from focusing on anything beyond getting students ready for college and careers. A lot of my most valuable lessons in high school came from class periods where we weren't necessarily hitting a specific common core standard, but were taking a somewhat broader view of education's goals. As one example just to illustrate more clearly, two lessons while reading a book were spent discussing and learning about sexual assault, with simply the hope that we would be better people by the end of it, not necessarily better writers or readers. I know that was a special experience in some ways, as in a lot of states spending that kind of time on a that kind of subject could never happen.

We definitely still hit the standards, ended up with strong test scores and were prepared well for college and careers, those things were never discounted. However, I enjoy the freedom Utah offers to broaden the horizons of education a bit alongside all of that important work. Living in Utah all of my life and watching teachers do this here, I know that it will be possible. But I'm not sure what the requirements and usual practices are in Chicago, especially in a district as large as CPS. If anyone--hopefully teachers in the area--has information or experiences seeing the way CPS or other Chicago districts apply common core standards to curriculum I would be extremely grateful to hear. Thank you so much.

tl;dr: My home state of Utah allows a lot of freedom for teachers to determine their own curriculum. Is that same freedom available in Chicago districts, especially CPS, or are there stricter mandates on how class time can be used and what content can be taught?",chicago,How strictly does CPS apply Common Core?

I thought I would share this event in case people had not seen it and are looking for a free event this Thursday (6pm - Midnight). It is free, which means free entry into the Field Museum!

Whereas TedTalks are all sit and listen style presentations of ideas this Night of Ideas appears to mix several art forms for your ""consumption"". You can attend Lectures, but also performances, panels, workshops, hands-on experiences, as well as discussions or apparently just wander around the Field Museum for free.  Everything is centered around the topic ""ALIVE"", but span gender, disability, philosophy,history as well as the environment, many of them focused on topics relevant to the Chicago area specifically.

The four things my Fiancee loves are me, our dogs, Highlander cows, and most of all CHICKENS! 

This man is absolutely in love with chickens and has been since the day I met him. He honestly wants nothing more than to hang out with them, give 'em some food, and have them enjoy some quality lovings. This has been unfortunately hard because petting zoos don't allow you to get close and none of our neighbors or friends have ever owned chickens in the city. 

 If anyone in the Chicagoland area is willing to let me and my fiancee enjoy an afternoon with your chickens I will happily pay for you and your chickens time. We will also travel to you and work with your schedule. 

Please DM or comment if you can help with this!",chicago,Help for a Valentine's Day surprise!

Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,

Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;

Stormy, husky, brawling,

City of the Big Shoulders:

They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys. 

And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again. 

And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger. 

And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them:

Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning. 

Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities; 

Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness,

Bareheaded,

Shoveling,

Wrecking,

Planning,

Building, breaking, rebuilding,

Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth, Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs,

Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle,

Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the heart of the people,

Laughing!

My boyfriend and I then were on edge for the next several stops -- we didn't want to misjudge him, but we were also worried if something was going on. I was hyperaware of everything so I knew my stuff was ok and not reachable, but I felt some rustling near my hips. Once it got very obvious, I looked over to find his hand partially inside my pocket. I awkwardly told him, ""I don't have anything in there."", though I actually had a bunch of snot-filled tissues from allergies. Once the train started going again (so he couldn't run in case he did have something), I got up and checked my stuff, and then my bf and I got off at our stop. 

My bf didn't quite know what was going on, but was being attentive to things. Now after the fact, I feel really skeeved out and gross. We also have agreed we should just move the moment we feel uncomfortable, rather than give people the benefit of the doubt. Is this sort of thing common? Also as a general PSA, be alert for the people sitting next to you!",chicago,Awkwardly avoided a pickpocket and feel skeeved out

As I did in ages past, I'm throwing another *singles-only* Valentine's Day party on Saturday, February 15th.  Don't laugh - at least one married couple resulted from one of these parties, and the next one could be YOU!

The party will be at my apartment at Diversey &amp; Western.  If you'd like to attend, please send me a DM with your name, sex, and *email address*.  I'll send out a mass email with exact info a day or so before the party.  Please RSVP this way even if you know where I live already - I'm going to be ""curating"" the attendee list to keep the sexes more or less balanced.

Here's the fun stuff: first, there will be a dress code.  Shirts/ties/dresses/skirts...dress to impress your fellow redditors.  Second, bring a dish to share - show off your culinary skills!  Feel free to bring whatever alcohol you'd like, but as this is a *classy* affair don't come expecting to get completely shit-faced.  Drink responsibly, and I reserve the right to remove anyone who's on the verge of behaving inappropriately.

Also, please be reasonably single - if you're poly and have a primary partner already, sit this one out.  If you're in a relationship but looking to cheat, sit this one out.  Let's keep things above-board.

Since space is limited, please RSVP only if you're 95-100% committed to attending.  It'd be a bummer if I turned people away only to have a bunch of people not show up.

This will be a good time in a low-pressure environment, so let me know if you'd like to attend!",chicago,Valentine's Day Party Feb 15 - Singles Only!

I don‚Äôt know what it is, but more and more in the past six months I am noticing drivers continuing to make left turns well after the arrow has gone away, and well after there are pedestrians in the crosswalk with the right of way and the walk sign. 

I have seen people nearly get hit, I have seen two fights nearly breakout between pedestrians that screamed at cars and the drivers who got out to confront them. I have seen cars not hesitate to turn into pedestrians and narrowly missed them by a foot or two, most of them completely oblivious to what they are doing as they make the turn.

Why is this happening all of a sudden it seems, and why am I noticing it so much lately?",chicago,"Is it me, or are more and more drivers rolling left turn signals downtown well after the light has changed?"

I want more announcements automated, and more announcements captioned. It‚Äôs not enough to know the train is going express, for example. I need to know where it‚Äôs going express to. 

Another example:
A few weeks ago, there was a potential bomb threat at Grand that shut down the Red Line. I had just boarded at North/Clybourn when there were incomprehensible announcements made by the driver. After a few announcements that sounds like sewer lids rattling around in a rat-infested dumpster, people departed the train, and then the platform. I assumed a delay. I was willing to wait 10-15 minutes to see if things resume, so I got LO‚Äôs iPad out.

Then, finally, the train operator came up to me and told me to evacuate, but even then I could barely understand her because of the din. Evacuate. Not just a ‚Äúdelay.‚Äù

I felt that much more vulnerable about riding the CTA while deaf, especially with my LO.

\- We like to drink and have fun, but aren't the strip club (or any 'club' really) type of group. Not trying to do our own version of The Hangover.

2845,2845,ahnnuen,1581736301,f43keo,Ask CHI,"Hi,

This is my first time posting on Reddit, so I'm sorry if I format things weird or if this is not the appropriate place for this question. 

I (21F) am currently a SoCal resident. I will have an interview for a very exciting job opportunity in Northbrook, IL in a few days. I am making this post in case I secure the job. If I were to get the job, here is my plan so far:

- Housing: My friend said her parents might be willing to house me at their home in Lincoln Park (35 minute drive without traffic to potential work place).  If not I plan to airbnb. The employer (who has briefly talked with me on the phone) strongly advised that I stay in the city and not the suburbs; she said she doesn't want a young person like myself living in the suburbs. I'm also more interested in living in Chicago as opposed to Northbrook: I was born in Vietnam and moved to the US when I was 14. I've never been in an environment where I am truly a minority, and I'm truly nervous about living in a  town that's mostly white. If possible, would someone please elaborate on their experience living in either of these places?

-Transportation: I'm planning on driving solo in my sedan from SD to Chicago, which is a 30 hour drive. I'm concerned about driving in the snow at this time of year (I've never even touched snow before in real life) and parking in Chicago (I've heard horror stories). I can't think of leaving my car and relying solely on public transportation though, since the job location is so far away. I know I should get snow tires for my car, but do I change them before I leave from SD, or when I get closer to Chicago? (Sorry if this is a naive question)

-Funds: I was very lucky that my parents help pay for my undergrad, so I have no debt to worry about. I also managed to save up from previous jobs in uni. I won't have to worry about healthcare because it is included with the job benefits. 

If anyone reading this is rolling your eyes about how unprepared and impulsive all of this is: Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm freaking out right now. But Chicago is such a beautiful city, and I want to get away from CA which is where I have spent majority of my teen and adult life. The job itself is also incredibly beneficial to my future career route, and I have not seen any jobs posted in California that matched up. I'm worried (maybe rather irrationally) that I will be fired for unforseen circumstances and all this will be for naught. However, I'm also afraid that if I don't make this move, I will regret my decision in the long run. 

If anyone could help this lost frantic young adult talk the logistics of this out, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you!",chicago,"Moving from San Diego, CA to Chicago. Help!"

Part of the problem is that my wife is moving with me and she is a teacher, she‚Äôs starting to look for poss jobs but it kinda looks like there will be more openings/postings toward June.

I guess my question really is: Where can I live that will be kinda near to Rush U med center, but also have lots of schools (mostly elementary or high school) for possible job opportunities nearby? As of this point we might be taking both cars, but we‚Äôre also still debating if we reaaaally need both, I know it‚Äôs expensive to pay per month for a parking space at apts. Also, we‚Äôre not really well off or anything (combined we will have about 90-100k income with lots of student and car loans) so cost will also likely be a limiting factor, but there are always ways to cut down on some of our costs.

I will be moving to Chicago this summer, and I've been searching for apartments for a while now. From a list of 50+, I got it down to two final candidates, [Atwater](https://www.liveatwaterchicago.com/) and [OneEleven](https://www.oneelevenchicago.com/). I will be touring both of them in a few weeks.

For anyone who is living/has friends living in each of these apartments, I was wondering what you think their pros and cons are. I am a big fan of good amenities within the building and proximity to bars/restaurant scenes. Also, if anyone currently lives in either of them, I'd love to give you a referral bonus in case I choose to live there. Please feel free to DM me if this is the case!

Thanks in advance for your insights!",chicago,Apartment hunting - Atwater or OneEleven?

Why are stations on the CTA so ridiculously close to each other?

3191,3191,JohnnyLakefront,1582286538,f7a3tc,Nan,"I **used** to go through a company here in Chicago called ""Insure on the Spot"" to find Auto insurance, until they set me up with a company called United Equitable.

If you have United Equitable, I think you should take a look at their [Better business bureau rating and complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/il/morton-grove/profile/insurance-companies/united-equitable-insurance-co-0654-5437).

I was in an accident while insured with them, and it's hard to describe just how exhausting the process was, and it went on for months.

Just extremely stressful, and it didn't end well. I know dressing with insurance companies is never fun, but this was a whole nother level.

To put it in perspective, the day of the accident, I had just been smashed into by a tourist flying down the road in a rental car, so I'm foggy. I called the insurance company to run me through everything I need to do to make sure I don't go something stupid. I specifically asked if I should or should not file a police report.

The woman on the phone goes ""I can't tell you that. We're your insurance company. But.... You don't **have** to file a report,"" emphasis not added.

I filed the report, and later found out that had I not filed a police report, the company could and likely would have completely thrown the whole thing out and I would have gotten no money for my totalled vehicle and hospital bills.

And it was all down hill from there. For months.

So, check your insurance, and if you use Insure on the Spot, make sure you look into who they set you up with.

Also note, that if you're prepaid for x months, it's state law that you can cancel your policy, and the insurance company has to refund you your money for the remainder of the policy. You are not locked in to anything.

Cheers, and DRIVE SAFE.",chicago,Insure on the Spot and United Equitable

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

Here is what they are trying to distract from &amp; cover up to retain power. $100+ billion in bribes to the highest offices in this country. 815+ deaths from child rapes to prove loyalty!

See the latest PDF updates: FBI Director Wray, AG Barr, SoD Shanahan, &amp; SoS Pompeo each raped boys and were paid billions in bribes for a Soros &amp; Koch funded child rape org. So did Trump &amp; his ""impeachment"" team Nadler,Schiff,Mueller.So did media moguls Redstone,Murdoch,Moonves. What are they trying to set up? **Who can arrest them since they are all bribed and in on it ?**

&gt;With three weeks left before the 2020 Democratic Primary, a new poll released today shows former prosecutor and Naval Intelligence Officer Bill Conway surging in the race for Cook County State‚Äôs Attorney. Conway is now within the margin of error (28% Foxx / 26% Conway / 6% Fioretti / 4% More), narrowing his deficit by more than 20 points after trailing Foxx by 22 in December. Additionally, in a head-to-head match-up Conway leads Foxx by 5 (41% Conway / 36% Foxx).  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúVoters across Cook County are tired of Kim Foxx‚Äôs status quo, where the politically-connected get one set of justice and everyone else gets another,‚Äù said campaign spokeswoman Eliza Glezer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that in Bill Conway they see the change we need: someone with the independence and experience to clean up the State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office so that it works for everyone regardless of who they know or where they‚Äôre from.‚Äù

3695,3695,mrhgibs1,1582921070,fb0vlq,Ask CHI,"I live in an apartment building with six units. Some of our packages have gone missing once they were delivered and I always assumed it was someone from outside sneaking into the foyer and grabbing them. However, yesterday we ordered household supplies, and they were in the foyer. I placed the package by the stairs because it was heavy and my hands were full so I would come back down for it later in the night. 

Well, a couple hours later I went down and it was gone! It was out of sight from outside so if must have been one of the tenants in the building. 

I think I have narrowed down who it is. I am friendly with tenants in two of the units and I highly highly doubt it is one of them. Could be but I really doubt it. Another tenant sent the landlord an email complaining about her missing package in October, so it definitely isn't her. That leaves one unit on the second floor and one on the top. The top floor tenants are brand new so it can't be them. That just leaves the 2nd floor tenant/s. 

I haven't told the landlord because I don't want the fuckers doing it to get spooked. If I confront them they will deny it, and I have no proof. If I install a camera they will be onto me, and that also wouldn't be proof because it could be any package. How can I catch them in the act? I am thinking as creatively as possible.",chicago,How do I catch a package thief in my building?

He has a white beak, Mallards beaks are yellow; he has two yellow check patches on his head, Mallards are all green; and his tail is not curled up at the end like a normal Mallard.  These are possible hybrid combos: Wigeon x Mallard, Pintail x Mallard, Gadwall x Mallard.  He seems to have a little of each bird, very unique for a hybrid.

The American Heart Association states that ""...about 1 in 5 people who have a heart attack [will be readmitted](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/04/04/proactive-steps-can-reduce-chances-of-second-heart-attack) for another one within five years of their first.

Bernie Sanders released numerous letters from his Doctor and Cardiologist where they stated that he has fully recovered and has the same working heart as most men his age.

However, I am troubled that he won't release his medical records to provide the details of the heart attack and the tests completed since he had it.

Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he didn't think Sanders' refusal to release his medical records was transparent, and he added: *""Transparency matters. Especially living through the Trump era.* [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-health/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-health/index.html)

Sanders could do what Senator John McCain did in 2008 during his campaign against then Senator Obama. McCain released 8 years of medical records to prove that he was fit and healthy enough to live during a four year term as President. [http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/24/medical\_records\_state\_mccain\_fit\_cancer\_free/](http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/24/medical_records_state_mccain_fit_cancer_free/)

Of particular interest to me is the issue of his heart's **ejection fraction**. 

For example, in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Post, a retired anesthesiologist named John DesMarteau from Washington stated: ""*As a physician and a voter, I want to know which arteries were blocked. I also want to know what the function of his left ventricle is. His one-year risk of dying from a heart attack is proportional to his left ventricular ejection fraction ‚Äî the percentage of blood that is pumped out of his left ventricle with each beat of his heart*.""

I am doing a research project for my linguistic anthropology class that concerns the use of ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"". I am interested in the demographics of people who use the titles to address others, as well as the circumstances surrounding the use of the terms.

We are seeing major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 develop in multiple European countries now because the authorities let various Carnival festivities occur late last month. The virus spread in China due to the mass movement of people during the Lunar holiday. It should be obvious to any so-called ""leader"" that the holiday mass gatherings of people should be stopped or canceled.

This virus has now caused multiple hospital systems around the world to collapse due to the intensity of infections. It has caused multiple countries to impose lockdowns over large geographic areas and strict quarantine regimens. It would be foolish to have a mass gathering in a city where it is extremely likely that the virus is spreading undetected among the population.

Coupled with the absolute lack of surveillance by public health authorities at local, state, and federal levels -- it is the worst malpractice by political leaders to pretend that the situation is anything close to normal. And it would be criminal to let something like the St. Pat's day parade happen in light of the pandemic engulfing the world.

To my thinking, a *block* is thus fundamentally a measure of distance derived from that basic rule. Therefore, a *block* to me is designated by the beginning of the next sequential ""hundred"" in the city numbering system. In other words, I think of Foster to Berwyn (5200 to 5300 N) as *one block*, even if Farragut runs at 5230 N between them in a given area.

I think this way of thinking helps me make logical sense of the system... but then I saw a comment earlier that Wellington is ""four blocks"" from Belmont. My first thought was ""Nuh-uh!"" but my second was to ask myself ""Why is my way right?"" Existential crisis ensued.

So... I'm clearly an overthinker but, TL;DR: Is ""a block"" just the distance to the next street, no matter if it's a short block or long one?

I graduated with a B.S. in business admin, am pretty much entry level for most things because the jobs I've had until the move were unrelated to my degree  (I was a video editor at a production company).

I really, really need to find a better (And better paying) job. LinkedIn and Indeed are fine and all, but I'm not sure what keywords to give them that won't result in account manager or sales rep. I'm definitely against doing that.

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

The impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) has changed a lot over the past week. The situation has morphed into something that is impacting all of our lives on a daily basis. Our daily COVID-19 megathreads served us well in the beginning but, due to the ever-changing nature of COVID-19, we realize that regulating all coronavirus posts and discussions to a daily megathread will no longer be the best solution in handling the topic.

As of today, COVID-19 posts will be allowed on the main page of /r/Chicago. Please be mindful that our other rules are still in effect and posts that violate those rules will continue to be removed. General conversation posts (such as personal anecdotes, unverified reports of new cases, etc.) will be redirected to our [Weekly Questions/Conversation Megathread.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/fjgwme/rchicagos_weekly_casual_conversation_questions/)

We appreciate everyone‚Äôs feedback, and hope that you all stay safe during this challenging time. Please see below for links to COVID-19 resources that you may find helpful.

It was fine until covid-19 escalated and social distancing became necessary, as he refuses to treat it as such. He's meeting up with random girls on Tinder/Bumble, he's going to grocery stores multiple times per day, he's m. We've talked to him about this, but he refuses to alter his behavior--he claims it's not big deal and we're taking this too seriously. We always thought he was a good guy but clearly, we were wrong. I asked him to move out (he still has access to his home where his wife is staying) but he refused. At this point, he's a health risk to my fiancee and I. The only thing we can think of doing now is changing the locks the next time he leaves and dropping his stuff off at his old place.

Even though he's not on a lease or anything, I'd imagine he still has tenancy rights to the place due to an oral agreement and having been here for 2 weeks already. If I just proceed to remove his contents from the place and lock him out, what legal consequences could we face?",chicago,"I need to evict a friend staying with us because he refuses to adhere to social distancing.

Chicago has (to me) very surprisingly cheap real estate in the Wicker Park, Logan, even downtown etc. areas compared to NYC/SF, etc., such that owning a 2-3 bedroom and be downtown or in a Brooklyn-equivalent area in Chicago suddenly seems within reach given my current career (tech). 2-3 bedrooms for 4-700k just... don't exist in other cities with the cultural, architectural, public transit, and tech/finance vibrance that Chicago seems to share.

What I missing? The taxes, specifically property, or any other gotchas to moving/living in CHI? Specifically given I'm from a coastal expensive city already, so I'm aware of the general COLA increases. I'd love an explanation in layman's terms. I'm aware the IL Pension is dramatically underfunded, and from various comments I've pieced together in here, home owning appears to be a downside in that environment? Just how bad is it?

Also, I work in tech - tech industry and general companies that support those jobs in Chicago, growing or not?

I hope you and yours are safe and well on the cusp of this new moon. My family and I are healthy and whole as of drafting this post. I know we're all worried out there, regardless of where we're from. I wish you and those you wish, strong health and patience. These are interesting times.

I find myself in an odd predicament that has led me to write this at such an eleventh hour. Truth is, I don't have anyone outside of the immediate family members under my roof. I have been at a complete loss as to who to talk to about this.

While I hate to be defined by only categories, I must take them into account when finding a place to live. I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge as well that the things that define me are amongst some of the reasons as to why I have settled my direction on moving to Chicago. 

Is there anywhere in Chicago you might suggest a couple of disabled, LGBT adults and their two, young, autistic kids look into living?

We have suddenly found ourselves in need of housing. We must be out of our current residence by March 30th. We are poor, have bad credit, stellar landlord reference, no evictions.¬†

Thank you for taking the time to read this,

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

I understand that thousands of people are trying to get through, but are we all just screwed right now?

I realize many people are out of work, but their office is closed, they are not answering phones, not answering emails, what are we supposed to do?

For example, a 7-day pass that was activated on March 15 and used only that day, would be eligible for a prorated refund reflecting six unused days. Prorated credits will be issued as Transit Value that is added to the cardholder‚Äôs Ventra account. Transit Value can be used to purchase passes in the future or for rides paid for individually from your value balance.

&gt;To receive a Transit Value credit, send an email to Ventra Customer Service (customerservice@ventrachicago.com) with the following information no later than April 13, 2020:
&gt;1. Account holder‚Äôs name,
&gt;2. Transit account ID number, and
&gt;3. Type of pass (7- or 30-day) in which a credit is being requested.

&gt;Unlimited ride passes (1-, 3-, 7-, 30-day passes):  Passes are only activated when tapped at a rail station or on a bus, so if you do not need to ride CTA using one of these passes, simply save your Ventra Card with inactive passes until things return to normal. You can log in to your account online to see if you have any active or inactive passes. 
 
&gt;**Deactivating autoload feature**: If you have autoload enabled, you can easily deactivate this feature through the Ventra app or on our website (VentraChicago.com). And it‚Äôs just as easy to re-activate autoload when things get back to normal. 
 
&gt;**Pre-tax transit benefits**: If you use your employer‚Äôs pre-tax transit benefits program, you can contact your employer‚Äôs administrator to turn off a 30-Day Pass or Transit Value deposits. These deposits generally occur on 26th of each month. Please note that employers or third-party administrators may take some time to process your request.",chicago,"CTA will be offering a one-time credit for any remaining days left on an active 7- or 30-day pass, based on when the pass was last used"

5944,5944,mcdj,1585162314,fovtf8,Ask CHI,"I am a sole proprietor. I run a photo retouching ‚Äúcompany‚Äù out of my home.  My clients see me as a business, and in fact I have an EIN.  But the fact of the matter is I'm just a dude who has a couple of clients at any given time. I‚Äôm basically a producer. I don‚Äôt do much of the retouching myself. I use freelancers.  

Last year I did well, but I mainly worked from May to November. That‚Äôs just when the work came in.  It was lucrative but not consistent. 

This year so far has been a wash. My main client from last year is a division of a major national retailer. The bulk of their work was photographed in the beginning of the year last year, and given to me starting in May. 

But I have no idea if they'll be back with as much volume this year, or any work at all. I did one or two images for them in January.

I don‚Äôt feel like I can call them in the middle of a pandemic looking for work. I know they‚Äôre all working from home.  It‚Äôs conceivable that they‚Äôre still shooting projects, working with their photographer remotely, but I don‚Äôt really know. 

I reluctantly looked at the Illinois form to apply for unemployment.  The first thing it asks is the name, address, and phone number of your previous employer.  The last thing I want is Illinois contacting my major client from last year and saying ‚ÄúThe retouching company you used last year is seeking unemployment.‚Äù, especially if they had planned to start giving me work again in May. 

And are they even considered an employer? I know the newly announced relief package has some consideration for freelancers but I have no idea how it will work.

I also don't know how it works in Illinois, but I was on unemployment once in NYC and you had to go to all these job sessions and track your attempts to find work and submit proof. How am I supposed to do all that now, on lockdown?  I don‚Äôt drive so a delivery gig is out.

My wife works at a children's hospital so it‚Äôs not like our household has no income, but the future is uncertain. I have no idea if she will be called to work on the front lines. God forbid something happens to her, or she brings the virus home because I‚Äôm over 50, overweight and have elevated blood pressure.

There are also four officers hanging out in front ignoring her.  Loathsome behavior I guess, but not against the law.

Then the passenger of her car just throws a full cup of soda out the window. Then a big paper bag full of garbage, and just kept throwing garbage out the window on the sidewalk. The officers looked up, but ignored them. We walked by the car, I stopped to glare at the two in the car from a few feet away, and they just ignored me, just as the officers ignored them. I was tempted to pick up the trash and throw it back in the car. But I just left it and walked away.

The system is \[b\]garbage\[/b\].  I was laid off at the end of last year and claimed unemployment.  The system is set up where you certify benefits weekly but have a window for only 2 working days a week.  Not sure if it's by design, but my window reported errors every other week.  So I effectively had 2 8 hour windows twice a month. Any time you do something not by the book, you get a generic ""you can't do this now"" error.   So in my case, if I missed one of those windows, I'd lose benefits -- which is what I did.  Every subsequent trip told me ""you can't do this now"" which of course raised no alarms as I had seen it so much.  

After getting the error for several weeks in a row I thought nothing of it as I was living off of the remainder of my severance so didn't need it immediately.  (Stupid thinking).  I was also studying 14 hours a day for interviews (for realz).   I saw devoting an hour plus to dick around on the phone as counter productive to getting employed in a competitive field.  Eventually I just reapplied and bit the bullet and called  As per before if you miss one of your very short windows you're booted out of the system.  You can try to file late, but they apparently don't want to hear that their system sucks shit, so I was denied.  I'm sure my reasoning that I was living off of savings/severance did not help my case. I'm employed now and thankful for it.  Most of my gut tells me to just move on as many more are in shittier situations now w/ the virus.  So, as part of my rage management I figured I'd just post it here and hope that someone else that is unemployed but not with a lot of time to waste can benefit.

**If you have previously been disconnected for a non-safety issue and are at home without power, please contact our Customer Care team so that we can work to try to get you reconnected safely.** Call 800-334-7661 M-F from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

We are prepared to work with every customer on a case-by-case basis to find payment arrangements and identify the best fit out of the many energy-assistance options ComEd has available.

1) We need PPE! The lack of Personal Protective Equipment (i.e. N95 Surgical Masks, face shields, gowns, gloves etc) is quite literally killing healthcare workers. If you or your business has PPE or has the capacity to produce PPE, feel free to reach out to me or provide your information in order to make a donation on this website: [https://sites.google.com/view/getmeppechi/for-donors?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/view/getmeppechi/for-donors?authuser=0)  
2) We need blood! Hospitals and blood blanks are facing an impending blood shortage so one of the most tangible ways you can support is by donating blood. You can find your closest bloodbank at any of the following links  
\-[http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx](http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx)  
\-[https://www.vitalant.org/Home.aspx](https://www.vitalant.org/Home.aspx)  
\-[https://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html](https://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html)  
3) We need support! Whether in the form of donating money to the PPE GoFundMe so we can purchase more PPE or calling your US Reps and Senators and asking them to support the Frontline Health Care Worker's Assistance Act, we need more voices and support in this effort.  


Thank you so much for reading, please feel free to PM me if you have any questions or other ways to help.",chicago,How you can support the response to COVID-19

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

6469,6469,Guinness,1585543363,frkemg,CHI Talks,"I'm just curious what you guys are seeing at your local markets? Now that its been a week or two, are things getting better or worse? I know some theorized (myself included) that there really wasn't much panic buying going on. Just that everyone was doing 2 weeks worth of shopping to prepare all at once. And others thought that the panic buying was rampant.

Target's stock has improved quite a bit. Hand soaps are now 95% fully stocked and the shelves are full. Meats are now 80% full of stock where 2 weeks ago they were completely empty. Canned goods are roughly 85% restocked where they were completely 100% wiped out. Things like refrigerated pasta, frozen foods, etc are all back in stock.

Everything is pretty much close to normal except a few items. Toilet Paper was still all gone. Acetaminophen is 100% out of stock. Dry pasta was still gone. And [isopropyl alcohol completely out](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2). Those were the only things I noticed that couldn't be bought in any quantity from any brand.

I also noticed that Target was almost completely void of customers at 6pm on a Sunday. In the self checkout there was an employee that just sat there and waited for someone to leave their station and it was immediately wiped down. Employees had gloves and masks on.

All things considered, if they're keeping all flavors of Jeni's Ice Cream in stock, I don't think we're going to starve to death anytime soon. And I think that'll be close to the end of panic buying.

What have your experiences been? Are you low on anything and you can't find any replacements?",chicago,How are your respective grocery stores holding up?

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

\------------------

In case you haven't seen these posts yet, I host these events called Skip the Small Talks where I put strangers in a room and get them talking to each other about more meaningful and interesting stuff than social norms generally allow. My background is in social and clinical psychology research, so my approach is informed by the literature on self-disclosure, question-asking, game theory, and some other stuff that I can nerd out about in person if you end up coming to the event and are interested in hearing me ramble for a while. But basically, we use cards with questions written on them and a lot of structure to allow people to open up to strangers more comfortably and quickly than you might usually.

People have reported finding Skip the Small Talks useful for meeting new people, for becoming more comfortable in social situations outside of Skip the Small Talk, and for interacting with humans in a low-effort context. Some Redditors said some nice stuff about us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/b0146n/experience_with_skip_the_small_talk/) if you want to check out other people's take on it.

You can check out all our events [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and you if you want to keep up with our events, you can sign up for our e-mail list [here](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/) (I don't spam, I don't share your e-mail address with anyone, and I really genuinely do hope you'll let me know if the e-mails ever start getting annoying).

If you do end up going and if you're feeling up for it, come say hi to me and let me know what you thought!",chicago,Skip the Small Talk: Upcoming ONLINE events!

I don't know if Jared Kushner knows this, but it's called '**The United States** of America' - and the federal government, which has a stockpile, is supposed to be backstopping the states.  He apparently does not know that.  Now, at the same level, we have stockpiles - at the city level, we have stockpiles.  And, we're using them now.  I don't think anybody expected a respiratory pandemic that would deplete all of the respiratory stockpiles that exist - and that the federal government would **abdicate** its role, and have 50 states and 5 territories on top of that all competing with one another, and competing against the federal government to get the PPE that's necessary.  So, I think Jared Kushner just does not understand this issue.  He does not understand what the federal government's role is supposed to be in a **national emergency**.""

**LL:**  ""And if I can just add - um, and I think the governor just showed incredible restraint under the circumstances - he is 100% right. We shouldn't have to **beg** the federal government to step up and assume its responsibility here. When we hear from the head of the CDC that the **federal stockpile** only has **10,000 ventilators**, the question we should ask is, **'What the heck has the Trump administration been doing over the last three and a half years?'** What that tells me, and I think what that tells public health professionals across the nation, is that the federal government has failed to do the planning that it needs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to be **prepared.** So, we're not waiting for the feds. We're doing what is necessary.  The governor and his team have been working tirelessly to source the materials that we need to bring to Illinois.  **But - my-oh-my - somebody like Jared Kushner casting aspersions on the hard work of governors across this country who have been working tirelessly - night and day - to be leaders, and to care for their residents and their states: that tells you a lot about the character of him.**""",chicago,JB Pritzker and Lori Lightfoot respond to a reporter's question about Jared Kushner's comments on the Strategic National Stockpile - 4/3/20

In this situation, a CDI stands on the podium and is given a ""feed"" from an ASL Interpreter, who is sitting in the front row, interpreting what is being said to the CDI, who then interprets into ASL. This provides a higher quality interpretation into ASL.

I feel like I‚Äôve only seen crime reports and I‚Äôm freaking myself out about the safety of living and traveling in the city. Realistically, how bad/frequent is it? Since I know it affects crime rates to a certain extent - I am female. 
I‚Äôve lived in the Chicago suburbs my entire life, and have visited quite a few times, so I‚Äôm not completely clueless as to how things work (be aware, don‚Äôt hold things out that are easy to grab, hold purses tightly and towards the front, etc.) but I‚Äôm curious how it seems from a less touristy point of view and more from a local point of view. 
Thanks! :)",chicago,How ‚Äúsafe‚Äù are student commutes?

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

What are we actually accomplishing by extending the lockdown? Hospitals were not even close to capacity even at our peak.

I think it's human nature to want to help as much as we can to stop this virus and we always strive to do anything we can to mitigate the damage. Unfortunately people have to understand that at this time there's really nothing we can do. Staying inside would only save lives if the hospitals were overcrowded which they are not and won't be considering we are past the peak. The only thing this lockdown really accomplished is slowing the spread and delaying some inevitable deaths by a few weeks. A vaccine is at least a year away and may never come at all. Herd immunity will likely come first.

Risks are all around us everyday, wether it's driving down the highway, getting the flu, obesity, etc. We could shut down all highways and it would be a guarantee that   accident deaths would decrease, but we don't. We could shut the city down every flu season and I guarantee that would also save lives. We have to look at this from all angles. Let people choose their own amount of risk. Closing small businesses and depriving people of their paychecks is just making this problem worse. 

Feel free to change my view on this matter.",chicago,The Shutdown Needs To End

1056,1056,NaturalDeselection,1587186834,g3i3dn,Ask CHI,"I experienced some street violence in Albany, NY and I wound up moving to Oregon as a result. My boyfriend's mom lives in Chicago and just rented a beautiful house there. We'd have an entire floor to ourselves, automatic managerial positions (she's the hiring manager), and I'd be a bit closer to my family back in NY. The house doesn't appear to be smack in the middle of an urban area, but I believe the job would be. I may have flexibility on which of the 5 Chicago locations I'd work in, but it would be in the nightlife industry doing communications-based work.

But I'm really worried about the environment. It's peaceful here, even downtown. What are my chances, realistically of hearing gunshots outside our window in Chicago? How about walking alone during the day - how safe is that for a smaller-framed woman? Does the crime depend on who you know as opposed to being random? Does all of this depend on the neighborhood (and if so, which areas are the safest or least safe?) Where I moved from, the crime was random - I stayed out of trouble and still someone try to someone kill me in broad daylight.

When I say ""safe,"" I mean things like catcalling, stalking, hearing gunshots, random acts of violence. I don't care if an area is wealthy, low income, or what the makeup of the population is. I legitimately only mean safety being a woman. What do YOU experience in Chicago?

If it's not a good fit for me, I'm not moving. Leaving my boyfriend and housing stability would be just as big of a decision as moving, though, so I need to know how it really is. I know stats can be misleading.",chicago,"My boyfriend wants us to move to Chicago from Oregon and I have trauma from street violence. Ladies, how safe is it ACTUALLY there?"
