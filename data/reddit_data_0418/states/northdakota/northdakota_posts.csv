129,129,FlatAppointment6,1583173243,fcgck3,Nan,"Eugene Butler was thought to be an eccentric man by many who knew him in the small farming community of Niagara, North Dakota. He was known to be a general oddball, but when he began to scream so loud that it could be heard across the fields throughout all hours of the night, his neighbors became convinced that he needed some help. In 1906, Butler was transferred to the North Dakota State Hospital, where he remained until his death in 1913. 

Butler had large swaths of land to his name, and throughout the next few years, his family members fought in court to divide the land up into various sections. After coming to an agreement, most sold the land afterwards for a hefty sum. Some buyers, however, got more than just land.

In 1915, workers renovating the property were digging a basement, when they found the skeletal remains of a human. And then another, and then another, and then another...Remains kept being found until there was a total of 6 bodies retrieved from underneath the building, found in a crawlspace which could only be accessed by a trap door.

Neighbors and local residents came out, some before the police, to see what all the fuss was about. 

Forensic science in rural America in 1915 was unfortunately not up to snuff by modern standards, so the police could think of no other method of transportation than to gather up all the remains that they  could find, put them into a box, and have them sent off to the Sheriff's office.

When the remains arrived, there was something VERY wrong: There were far less than six humans worth of bones in the box. Upon further investigation, the police found out that locals had been taking the remains as souvenirs. To further add to this bizarre situation, the box containing the remainder of bones went missing after a certain number of years, along with the original case file, and all info on the matter. Items that were likely stored in the courthouse basement or police department records room were now gone, either stolen, or discarded when someone thought that they would be of no further use.

There are an estimated 40,000 unidentified bodies in the United States, according to the department of justice. Many of these are buried in unmarked graves, or sitting in evidence lockers and storage in the backrooms of North America's coroner and law enforcement offices. In most states, officials are not required to report their statistics and information on missing and unidentified individuals, so the federal government only has around 13,000 logged in their database, a far cry from what is likely the real number of unidentified decedents in the country.

The victims of Eugene Butler remain an anomaly. In most cases like this, individuals go missing, and are later found deceased, but without their names. In this case, the victims went missing, were found deceased, went missing again to be seen as novelty items by the individuals that stole them, and remain missing.

Butler was a land owner who grew crops. Like many in his position, he hired seasonal workers to help him out with various agricultural duties. Sometimes he hired lone transient workers, small groups of people, and may have even hired a whole family at one point to help with tasks around the farm. It is not known which of these categories his victims fall into. He may have killed workers periodically, killed an entire family, or any other manner of despicable acts committed against innocent individuals. Regardless, someone knew these people. Someone gave birth to them, raised them, loved them, became their friend, went to school with them, married them, worked with them, or any other manner of acquaintance, only to have that individual murdered in cold blood and dumped into a crawlspace with others in an identical situation.

It is impossible that someone who knew any of these people still lives out there today, but that does not mean that they don't deserve a proper burial, and to have their name back. Somewhere, these individuals still exist. They may be sitting in a shed, attic, basement, tucked away in an old suitcase, or any other place that you can imagine. Regardless, they have to be out there, and it is very likely that some of them are still in the hands of the families that stole them, only to be passed down for generations as some sort of sick heirloom. It could be you, your family, your friends, anyone. You could hold the key to solving this mystery, and all that you have to do is pick up the phone.

If you, or anyone that you know, is currently in the possession of any human remains in the state of North Dakota, or surrounding areas, and you have reason to believe that these remains were not obtained through legitimate means, please call the Grand Forks Sheriff's Department.",northdakota,"Are you in possession of any human remains that may have been passed down in your family for generations?

The  authority, government and many organization are hiding a lot of real  info about the new corona virus from the public for whatever reasons  like lose the regime, cause chaos or continue enslave the people, not  just only China, Vietnam must also including USA, Europe, etc. All over  place.

So if you are seeking for  the truth information, real knowledge, uncensored news, open discussion,  cure &amp; solution for the new corona virus named as NCOV, COVID-19 or  SARS-COV-2, then the only webpage online is **theworld.data.blog** and **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

The  fact is that the media &amp; government are toying with people’s life.  They are only promoting fear and scare to face the truth. They were not  telling the real information about the corona virus from the beginning  and probably in the future as well.

Even  I as a Savior want to telling you the truth, real information about  this epidemic with just text-based message, they think me as fear-maker,  and delete all the messages online. Many of my information now even  scientist was confirmed like the started for this epidemic event from  October/November or the real features of this virus, but many still not  yet confirmed and verified yet.

If  they say cannot talk in the public or big media sites, then it would be  ok, but instead they are deny in all fake free speech websites as well.

You  need to understand that even the top government officials, top doctors  who have access to top notch medical care had died because of this new  corona virus, they cannot protect themselves so there is freaking any  reason they can protect normal people like most of you.

The  new corona virus is not yet peak, the full strength of that virus will  only appear in the summer time. The current situation is too dangerous  for normal people to deal with.

That  why from now I will provide free working cure &amp; solution at private  matter for all of you, if you are rich (have more than 5 millions USD  worth of asset) then you must donate money, but all with restrict  conditions and limited time. But only at **theworld.data.blog** or **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

But  if you are willing to open your mind, want to face the scary hard  truth, accept new knowledge then you can visit that websites. If you are  the anti-christ with big ego and do not want to change, then do not  visit.

Remember everything has the limit and I have the final decision of anything on that website.

The  authority cannot save you, only you can save you, and only the savior  can give you real working advice, cure &amp; solution to overcome this  crazy epidemic event.
