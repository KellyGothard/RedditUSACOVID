This is probably a really stupid question and comment so forgive me. One of the reasons I have been interested in moving to Florida is the Oceans and swimming. One of my favorite things is swimming in the ocean and sea. I can't do that in NY its freezing and rough. So my ideal situation would be to live near a beach and be able to swim when the weather is good. I'm not a beach hang out person. I don't like lying on the beach except to dry after a swim. The more I read about Florida the more I realize I can't really find any info on that. I realize vacationers swim but not much info on residents. Also in summer is there relief from the heat in the ocean? Ok thank you for reading my silly question ;)",florida,Moving to Florida Question

Can anyone tell me if Venice FL is a good place to start a family for someone in their mid 30s (and currently single)? I'm researching it online now...it seems like it's a ""small beach town"" -- but how small is small? 

Ideally....I'm looking for a safe city that has at least 125k residents. That's not too big and not too small in my book. However, I could go smaller if there's ample shops like Best Buy, Target, and the other big box stores that make modern life possible in America.

I currently live in a desert city and I hate it...it's so arid out here. I was born/raised near the ocean and I require humidity, fog, clouds, water, salt in the air, and rain to survive.

Politics-wise...I'm pretty much middle of the road. Sometimes lean conservative on things like finance and immigration. 

Can I get someone's thoughts on Venice--or a nearby area on the gulf coast that has the above qualities?

It appears as if a 2 bedroom apartment in Venice runs for about 1,400/mo. which is nearing my upper limit of what I would like to pay in monthly rent. I would be in the market for a new home in a few years if I like the area. I'm also self-employed and that's another reason why I'm considering this area...as long as I have an internet connection and cell phone service I'm good to go.

As far as entertainment goes...I'm very easy to entertain. Don't require much more than my Playstation and some cool places to go hiking and sight-seeing. 


thanks

Oh also...are there a lot of assholes in Venice or nearby areas? That would be a deal breaker for me. I like friendly people as I'm friendly myself.",florida,Venice FL?

On my way out to AZ I was rear ended and my car was totaled. The person who hit me's insurance paid off the car and cut me a check. I bought a new pickup to replace it.

Now I get a note in the mail from the state of Florida saying my insurance company notified them that I had cancelled the insurance on that vehicle and that if I didn't show proof that I had sold it or that it was no operational that they would suspend my license and that it would cost $150 to have it reinstated. I now have my AZ license but I don't want anything bad to happen or if I ever moved back to Florida wouldn't want something weird to pop up.

There were no phone numbers to call in the letter and my only options were submitting proof of sale or new registration in new state. The insurance company didn't give me any proof of sale and it was never registered here.

Upon first glance the hotel room was older but had a fresh coat of paint and a newer looking flat screen. All was well until I opened the fridge. From the fridge came a terrible odor and a small roach.

I am planning to hire an attorney next week, but looking through their various websites, I see some push some services over others and if it is most likely out of reach, I'd rather not waste everyone's time by calling a diversion mill, first.

Several advertise getting clients into a pre-trial intervention or diversion program which would be ideal, but it's limited to first time offenders and those with just one conviction. A couple of the websites say that the state attorney will run a background check to verify eligibility. I assume this would be a nationwide criminal record search, but can anyone attest to this and whether it is a lifetime search, or would a 20+ year old, out of state conviction not show?

Before I start by calling a firm which specializes in diversions instead of an attorney who looks from their advertising to be better suited to represent a client in court, I thought I'd ask the sub for their knowledge and experience. Also because the situation is rightfully weighing on me, I am interested in any info that could tide me over for a few days.

**Tamara Lush**

ASSOCIATED PRESS

ST. PETERSBURG — In 2019, Florida Banana managed to eclipse Florida Man. From alligator antics to naked people doing wacky things, Florida did not disappoint in the weird news department this year.

(So many naked people.) In December, a Miami couple spent more than $100,000 on the “unicorn of the art world” — a banana duct-taped to a wall — during Art Basel. The piece was widely copied and mocked on social media, and then someone at the art fair ripped it off the wall and ate it.

Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan sold three editions of “Comedian,” each in the $120,000 to $150,000 range.

“We are acutely aware of the blatant absurdity of the fact that “Comedian” is

SIOBHAN MORRISSEY VIA AP

an otherwise inexpensive and perishable piece of produce and a couple inches of duct tape,” one couple that purchased the banana said. “Ultimately we sense that Cattelan’s banana will become an iconic historical object.”

Florida is known for many things. Sunshine, beaches and oranges. The magic of Disney and the glamour of South Beach. It’s also known for having the most bananas news in the United States.

As they often do, alligators topped the list of odd stories. Perhaps the most visually interesting happened in October, when Paul Bedard, who is contracted with the state’s nuisance alligator program, responded to a call of a gator in a swimming pool in Parkland. Bedard “played” with the 8-foot long reptile until it became tired. Then he lifted it out of the water and held it over his head for an Instagram photo.

“I haven’t had a good-sized gator in a swimming pool in probably a year, so I was kind of looking forward to this when I got the call,” he said. The alligator was relocated to a wildlife park.

Humans tangled with gators in a multitude of other ways. One reptile knocked on a woman’s door the night before Thanksgiving in Fort Myers. In Martin County, two men poured Coors beer into an alligator’s mouth. They were arrested.

Alligators weren’t the only animals making headlines in Florida.

In August, a restaurant in Stuart canceled its “Monkey Mondays” when a 9month-old capuchin named JoJo bit a child’s finger.

Also in August, a Lake Worth Beach man began feeding a kinkajou (a raccoon relative with a prehensile tail that’s native to Central and South America), but one day, it attacked his leg. “It was not a nice kinkajou. It was super aggressive,” the man’s girlfriend told The Palm Beach Post.

And a Labrador retriever somehow got behind the wheel of a car and did doughnuts in Port St. Lucie.

Some claim Florida’s weird news surfaces because of the state’s open public records laws, while others chalk it up to the fact that it’s the third largest state, with more than 21 million people packed on a peninsula – many wearing scant clothing because of infernal heat most of the year.

Whatever the reason, taking stock of the year’s strange stories in Florida is a time-honored tradition. This year’s no different, because the unusual is met with a chuckle and shrug precisely because it’s so normal. (Honestly. In 1986, the state’s official tourism slogan was “Florida … The Rules Are Different Here”).

Consider Patrick Eldridge of Jacksonville, who parked his tiny Smart Car in his kitchen because he was worried it would blow away during Hurricane Dorian.

The owners of a Port Orange funeral home gave away a free cremation as part of its grand reopening.

A toilet exploded in Port Charlotte when lighting struck the home’s septic tank. No one was injured, and homeowner Marylou Ward expressed relief: “I’m just glad none of us were on the toilet.”

Folks attacked one another with all manner of items, including (but not limited to): pancake batter, Pop-Tarts, a fake Christmas tree, swords, McDonald’s condiment packets and roach spray.

In the city of Port Richey, two mayors were arrested in the span of 20 days – one on charges of obstruction of justice; the other, on allegations he was practicing medicine without a license in his home.

Lest you think all Floridians are strange, a few did some remarkably kind things.

Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack went to his hometown of Fort Pierce and stopped by a Walmart store in December. He paid off all the layaways, to the tune of $80,000, according to the Chicago Tribune.

A Florida 9-year-old gave his third grade teacher all the feels when he offered his $15 of birthday money as a solution to the problem of teachers being underpaid.

In Gulf Breeze, a 73-year-old man wanted to “take a little bit of stress out” of the season for his neighbors and secretly gave $4,600 to help 36 families pay their water and gas bills.

But it’s the weird that attracts the most attention here. A number of people were nude, or partially nude, when they made the news.

In Polk County in December, a Florida man was “buck naked” when he showed up to the front door of a home where an undercover sex sting operation was being conducted, sheriff’s officials said. A naked Florida man burglarized an elementary school in Apopka and spread feces throughout the building. Cops chased a lot of naked people through parking lots, swamps and stores, too many to list here.

In Miami in March, motorists captured on camera a nearly nude man wearing hot pink socks, sneakers, skimpy underwear and a pink headband, bicycling backward down I-95.

Tl;Dr - 19-01 guts or outright eliminates Section 8(a) of Article 1 which was drafted into the state's Constitution to specifically protect firearms rights. This proposal, if voted on in the general election all but turns Florida in California Lite™. AG Moody has spoken out against this amendment to the Supreme Court. Hold your breath and wait to see what the Supreme Court rules on this one. While it appears to have lost steam there may be large batch submission closer to February 2020.

Per u/GunnyMcGunsmith on 21DEC19 - ""Regarding 19-01 A source close to me attended a briefing which said they’re transitioning out of signature collection and into getting people to vote for it on the ballot. This seems to suggest they’ve been banking signatures and we likely need to work now on preventing this from being passed here in FL.""

""They also suggested that there’s a lot of Bloomberg money behind it. I hate to say it but we might be set to be a repeat of Virginia here in a moment.""

19-03 has been listed as 'Closed'. It will not make an appearance on the 2020 General Election ballot.

19-05, though not directly firearm related, if passed, would provide a buffer to the previous two amendments. It has begun certifying signatures as of 24July19 ~~but only two remain verified.~~ Recently it has dropped a signature and is back to only one verified signature.

19-08 is growing by leaps and bounds and at times by 10k signatures between Politics threads. This amendment has been reviewed by AG Moody 11OCT19 and is on it's way to being scheduled for the FLSC's docket. Of all proposals being covered here this one appears the most likely to show up on the ballot. As of 12NOV19, it has been sent to the Supreme Court.

* The day before she was found, she was seen walking northbound while hitchhiking on US 1 at about 6:30 PM.

* She had multiple earrings in each ear, which were pierced four times.

* She may have been pregnant at some point in her life.

* She had been strangled with a bikini top and beaten, possibly raped
* The day before she was found, she was seen walking northbound while hitchhiking on US 1 at about 6:30 PM.
* There was a sign that she did try to fight back from her attacker meaning she was trying to defend herself. This means her attacker may have had scratches or other wounds on them.

309,309,Distressful,1578800157,eniaix,AskFlorida,"Greetings Florida folks, a native Hoosier here. I've lived in Indiana all my life and its been good but I've really begun to dislike living in this yearly cycle of weather that comes with the region.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt like I'm a ""cold blooded"" type of person, and I really thrive in the summer when the weather is hot and the days are long. I love going to concerts and traveling during the summer, and make it a point to attend as many events as I can. Fall is okay here, very mild. Winter can be a very brutal, disheartening time for me. It feels very oppressive, and I suffer from seasonal depression for many months until spring brings me back to life. As I've gotten older, now 23, I have begun to get more and more disappointed during winter since I feel like I'm just waiting for the weather to improve so I can simply get out and start doing things with life again. There are essentially 3-4 months of the year which are unusable to me. From what I understand, there is less of a vast difference between seasons in Florida, which sounds absolutely amazing. I would like to move ANYWHERE in Florida, and I have family who currently live in Sebring, which from what I've gathered is a retirement type of place. I've been to tourist destinations in Florida 3 times, and really admired the state.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would like to get some info on, is where some good starter places to live at would be for someone transferring from a place like Indiana. I'm not specifically looking for a place near the beach or anything too fancy, but would like a place with good job options, something casual. My career revolves around manufacturing and quality assurance, which is a pretty ubiquitous type of work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started feeling like life is too short to waste time not doing what you want to do, and I feel ready for a change. If things went well I could enjoy the 2020 summer/fall here in Indiana and then have enough info, savings, and a decent plan to move somewhere that suits my situation. That's the only thing I'm really lacking on: is information/guidance. If anyone on this sub could help me out with at least getting an idea of locations of interest or relatable experiences, that would be amazing. My relatives currently will also have some ideas for me so I will be studying if I get a reply or not. If anyone does have personal suggestions, feel free to shoot me a PM! I would love to join your state.",florida,Moving from Indiana to Florida

Tl;Dr - 19-01 guts or outright eliminates Section 8(a) of Article 1 which was drafted into the state's Constitution to specifically protect firearms rights. This proposal, if voted on in the general election all but turns Florida in California Lite™. AG Moody has spoken out against this amendment to the Supreme Court. Hold your breath and wait to see what the Supreme Court rules on this one. While it appears to have lost steam there may be large batch submission closer to February 2020.

Per u/GunnyMcGunsmith on 21DEC19 - ""Regarding 19-01 A source close to me attended a briefing which said they’re transitioning out of signature collection and into getting people to vote for it on the ballot. This seems to suggest they’ve been banking signatures and we likely need to work now on preventing this from being passed here in FL.""

""They also suggested that there’s a lot of Bloomberg money behind it. I hate to say it but we might be set to be a repeat of Virginia here in a moment.""

19-03 has been listed as 'Closed'. It will not make an appearance on the 2020 General Election ballot.

19-05, though not directly firearm related, if passed, would provide a buffer to the previous two amendments. It has begun certifying signatures as of 24July19 but only two remain verified. Recently it has dropped a signature and is back to only one verified signature.

19-08 is growing by leaps and bounds and at times by 10k signatures between Politics threads. This amendment has been reviewed by AG Moody 11OCT19 and is on it's way to being scheduled for the FLSC's docket. Of all proposals being covered here this one appears the most likely to show up on the ballot. As of 12NOV19, it has been sent to the Supreme Court.

328,328,tallyho347,1578863242,entgu0,Nan,"I see these posts a lot. People asking advice on moving to Florida. Figured I'd just put this out there. I can't speak for North Florida, I've never lived there but have lived in south and central Florida and moved from NYC.

Let me start out saying Florida is an awsome place to retire. It's not great for people trying to build up and start out though. The pay is extremely low and the cost of living is extremely high. A trend you will see down here is retirees and people who made money up north and out of state then moved saying ""it's great, it's so cheap ect. 

Unfortunately the pay to cost of living is atrocious. Central Florida rents in osceola and orange county are about 1200 for a 1 bedroom right now. For comparison you can get a similar apartment in the NY metro area (north Jersey, lower Westchester, and parts of the outer boroughs) for 1600. Utilities (water electric) are about 150 a month in Florida. NYC you're looking at 250. You're car insurance is the same, car payments are the same, food you might save 100 a month if your lucky. So to be generous let's say you're saving $1,000 a month on basic necessities. Plus your state tax (I'll get in to that more later)

So you've saved 12,000 a year moving to the sunshine state. This seems great. Unfortunately you're not saving anything. The pay is different. NYC sanitation workers (garbage men) make about 80k without over time. Skilled trades can easily bring in 120k without overtime. Even unskilled labor like flaggers for construction workers make about $30 an hour. These high pays are to offset the cost of living. And don't forget over time Is time and a half. Meaning the more you make the better the overtime. Alot of the jobs in NYC are also offering pensions. 

In Florida these jobs pay sooo much less. Sanitation workers are making $17, skilled trades are paying low to mid 20's, and unskilled labor you can expect $8.46-12.50. This pay was decent 10-15 years ago when cost of living in Florida truly was cheaper. $800 rents, 150k houses ect. 

The reality is alot of people move to Florida for a better life and not all but lot dont know what they're getting into because the old Florida is not here anymore. Rents are high, houses are just as expensive as NYC when you compair cost to the pay, rents are even higher, and national/global companies don't reduce the cost of their products in areas where people make less money. You might save 12,000 a year but you are going to 1/2 the money or less. The state tax in NY, one of the highest taxed states, is 4% to 8.5% . The bracket you fall I to under 215,000 a year is 6% meaning on every 100k you 6,000. So you're saving as a garbage man about 18k a year (with cost of living savings) but making 44k less. Meaning you're loosing about 26,000 a year. 

You can get cheap housing in Florida, but be prepared to live in the ghetto. NYC ghettos and Florida ghettos are very very different. Mayor Giuliani really cleaned up NYC. The crime rate is historically low even with the mentally disabled mayor running the show now. Florida hasn't had that same cleanup of crime. Florida has open air drug markets which haven't been seen in NYC since the late 90's (open air is selling drugs on the corners freely). The murder rate and violent crime rate are higher down here. 

Another one is schools. If you have a family or plan on having a family, remember public schools suck in Florida. It's partly because we don't have a state tax and relie on federal funding and the lotto to pay for students. If you don't use public schools private or home schooling is the only option because there aren't charter schools. Essentially the underfunded schools in states with a state tax are even more poorly funded without the state tax. The road work is paid for by toll roads which are EVERYWHERE! Not to mention the TRAFFIC!!!! You haven't seen traffic like Florida before! I promise you it's some of the worst in the country, if not the world. 

Oh I almost forgot!!!! Moving to Florida with the same company and the same pay can end very badly. Don't forget large companies operate their branches under different management. I know a few people who moved with a New York salary and were fired not too long after because they made too much money. One was a secretary for a large corporation. She was offered the transfer with the same salary. When the company looked over their expenses they seen she was very generously compensated compaired to her co-workers and fired her and replaced her with a cheaper employee. Same for a friend who was a retail manager. He was a top performing manager in his district for many years. As a result they asked him if he would move to Florida to help with the opening of a new branch in Maimi same pay as NY. He accepted and was fired 2 years later, which he says was around the time it takes to establish the store and when it started actually turning a profit. The reason they can do this is Florida is an at will state and your employer can fire, repremanded, or demote you at any time for any reason. That's 2 examples. I know more. They've found Jobs since but at a reduced salary. 


So now that you know a little more, remember that more people moving here makes things even more expensive. If you still want to move here cool, but don't say I didn't warn you. I'm moving back to NY in March because the civil servants exam is open and its triple what I'm making here. It's a heavy tourism based economy. So hospitality, service, food, retail, and theam parks are where the majority of jobs are. Over 30% of all the money coming into the state of Florida is from Disney, universal, sea world, and other theam parks. They don't provide quality jobs but are the biggest sources of employment. Corporate may be different idk. 

Also I used NYC as a reference because it's a place I've lived and have personal experience living in. Its also considered one of the most expensive places to live. I could go in into high rates of scams, fruad, poverty, hidden homelessness of theam park employees. But I think I've given you enough of a base to start looking in the right direction. Use google and be skeptical and honest when making a pros and cons list. Otherwise you'll be like me and a lot of others who move/live here and end up working 2 jobs, overtime, w.e and still coming up short. I didn't and took my job opportunities for granted and bought into the lie the sunshine was selling. It took me 2 years to save enough to move to Florida comfortably. It took me 3 years to scrape together enough to get to move to my cousins couch in NY very uncomfortably. So remember its easier to get in then get out.",florida,Advice for anyone planning to move to central/south Florida.

Not that North Florida is vastly better but for some folks it could be.  I have a feeling that the Southern culture of North Florida, and the slower pace of life, combined with the cooler temps in the winter, might be reasons why North Florida isn’t on the list of places to move to, even though it might be a far smarter move for people who aren’t bringing a cushy financial situation with them.

There is a *massive* influx of people coming to the state, more than ever before, wages are some of the lowest in the nation, and the only industries with a high salary is the military contractors throughout Central Florida and medicine with the former being a complete boom/bust industry. You could argue banking as well, but that is not nearly as high paying as the other two in this state on an average. Tourism is the number 1 employed job market here, and its pay is laughable. Teachers have the lowest rated salaries in the nation, and cities are not seeing the financial support to acclimate to the changing climate in a timely manner. Housing and rent prices are skyrocketing, and land as well as entire ecosystems are constantly being torn down to put up more cookie cutter housing with outrageous prices in areas that don't have the job market to support it.

The entire state is setting itself up for a massive failure the likes no other state has ever seen. When California had its massive boom, it at the very least had the Silicon Valley to support it. When New York boomed long ago, it had the financial industry and Wall Street to support it. When Texas said its influx, it had the oil and gas industry as well as the reach of the Dallas and Houston economies to support it. Florida does not have that support. 

This state is a ticking time bomb, and it is absolutely terrifying.",florida,"Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but Florida is on the path to economic disaster."

Every time I go to Florida, I never want to leave! I am highly considering moving to Florida for at least a year while I'm still young. single, and don't have any real commitment to stay in Jersey. That being said, I've only ever visited Orlando. I really like it there and would consider moving there but I've heard mixed things. I'm considering Tampa as well but I'm definitely open to suggestions. I am most likely going to sublease. I currently have $5,000 saved and am saving more. What's a good city to live in for a young single in Florida? 


Things I'm looking for (but am able to compromise) :

- Would like to be less than an hour from the beach

- Ideally would like to be less than 2 hours from Disney World / Universal  (more willing to compromise on this one)

- Decent nightlife

- Ideally would like to be around people in their twenties  

- An area that I'd make decent money bartending

360,360,VirusMaster3073,1578967231,eoeegk,Nan,"Forgive me if this sounds dumb

The main reasons that area attracts me are:

* I'm a big city person, and I feel like Charlotte is too suburban for my tastes (especially since I currently live in the actual suburbs)

* I want a tropical climate (I hate winter, and I would much rather be blazing hot than blazing cold. Also I get to go outside in shorts and sandals every day, even in January)

* Miami in particular has EDM festivals (big EDM listener)

* I really like the beach, so I want to visit it more often

* As an extra plus, my cousins live in Florida (lakeland or near there) and my Parents often visit florida since they like cruises a lot

* I'm currently learning Spanish, so moving to primarily Spanish-Speaking Dade county doesn't bother me

So, anyway, I am considering moving to either Dade or Boward County (anything north of Boward is probably too suburban for me)

My main criteria for which area in either of these counties specifically are as follows:

* Not too sketchy (but hopefully not ridiculously expensive)

* Walkability and Decent public transit for minimal use of car (I do intend to take my van with me but I want to use it as minimally as possible)

So, yeah, what advice do you have?",florida,"After College (I know, long time from now), I might be considering moving to South Florida (either Dade or Boward county) from the Charlotte NC area. Any advice?"

*Timing - Aiming for around a week in early April, I think I just miss spring break and the weather is getting nice?

*Travel - Linked to location I guess, but I'm wondering how easy it is to get around in terms of public transport as I don't plan on renting a car. Like how easy is it to visit all these fantastic looking nature preserves from fairly central locations?

I just want to say that I love Florida. I'm a native Floridian currently working in Seattle for work (been here for 2.5 years with another 2.5 years to go...  it's so depressing and soul crushing with the dreary cold) but I love all the pictures and videos y'all post about our beautiful, diverse, weird, hilarious, and flawed state.  


They are the sunshine in my cloudy days here and keeps me going and excited to eventually be able to return to a place with bright colors, heat, practically no winter, sunshine, crazies, lazy Spanish moss, palm trees, gators, humidity hugs... and be around people who also enjoy that as well (for the most part, I know there are some people who dislike heat and Florida the same way I dislike the cold and Washington state here).  


I've been listening to the podcast ""Florida is Sinking"" by 2 dudes in DeBary and although sometimes I disagree with some of what they say (one isn't even a big fan of Florida, lol) it just makes me happy to hear about a typical Florida experience with a humorous spin by 2 random white guys just living their Florida lives. It makes me feel more connected to a community than what I feel here. (If anyone else has other Florida-focused media suggestions, let me know!)

I don't need or want a fancy expensive house. Something small/modest that is clean is fine for me, but I do want a big yard, and I don't really want a condo situation.

So I'm only searching these RE websites for houses below $300K, and I'm seeing a lot of houses even under $200K (there is nothing in my own city below $500K just for comparison). 

It has me wondering, are houses in Florida priced below $200K likely to have issues? Such as... were they flooded in a hurricane? Hidden mold? Other issues?

Tl;Dr - 19-01 guts or outright eliminates Section 8(a) of Article 1 which was drafted into the state's Constitution to specifically protect firearms rights. This proposal, if voted on in the general election all but turns Florida in California Lite™. AG Moody has spoken out against this amendment to the Supreme Court. Hold your breath and wait to see what the Supreme Court rules on this one. While it appears to have lost steam there may be large batch submission closer to February 2020.

Per u/GunnyMcGunsmith on 21DEC19 - ""Regarding 19-01 A source close to me attended a briefing which said they’re transitioning out of signature collection and into getting people to vote for it on the ballot. This seems to suggest they’ve been banking signatures and we likely need to work now on preventing this from being passed here in FL.""

""They also suggested that there’s a lot of Bloomberg money behind it. I hate to say it but we might be set to be a repeat of Virginia here in a moment.""

19-03 has been listed as 'Closed'. It will not make an appearance on the 2020 General Election ballot.

19-05, though not directly firearm related, if passed, would provide a buffer to the previous two amendments. It has begun certifying signatures as of 24July19 ~~but only two remain verified.~~ Recently it has dropped a signature and is back to only one verified signature.

19-08 is growing by leaps and bounds and at times by 10k signatures between Politics threads. This amendment has been reviewed by AG Moody 11OCT19 and is on it's way to being scheduled for the FLSC's docket. Of all proposals being covered here this one appears the most likely to show up on the ballot. As of 12NOV19, it has been sent to the Supreme Court.

I understand that at least some portion of other drivers are tourists, but I wonder if it is them or native Floridians that do it this way. No other drivers give right of way, Everyone tries to cram in and cut off on the highway unless I’m on the bumper of the car in front of me, speed limits appear to mean nothing, there are no turn signals in any form, and besides the drivers the roads are insane. Why is every turn a left? I’ve driven several hours a day for three days at least each time I visit, and I can count every right turn I’ve made on my two hands.

Obviously some of this is frustrated exaggeration, and I truly can’t speak to cities other than Miami, but I really want to know if this is tourism, just the way people in Florida operate, or something else entirely.

566,566,The-Sigma,1579583858,erpzm0,Nan,"Why is it that so many bodies of water in FL are so murky? For example, the Indian River Lagoon. Is it caused by shallow water? The wind kicks up and causes the silt on the bottom to mix in? Perhaps, it's from the vegetation along the banks of the rivers. Is it from stagnation? Only so many inlets for fresh water to flow in and out. Pollution, algae, etc? 

I've noticed that some parts of northern FL have really dark colored rivers. I assume the flatness plays a role. The rivers are slow moving. 

Along the beach, I find that the water clarity can vary a lot. Some days it's crystal clear, almost Caribbean like. Especially down in the keys. Other days, after wind, it's the complete opposite. 

When I lived up north, there was variation in water clarity and color but not like down here. What causes the water in the keys to turn that beautiful clear blue?

Second part of this question: does the stained water have any affects on health? If the water is really dark one day, is it bad to go wade fishing? Any chance of getting an infection? Are the fish okay to eat provided there isn't any active red tide? 

Thanks for your comments.",florida,Why is the water in FL so cloudy?

One of the Front Desk agents at the hotel I work at found a frozen iguana in the grass on her way into the building. Our team decided that in the name of hospitality this iguana deserved a nice warm bed like our guests. She was treated to a fresh bed near the dryer output in the back of the building - probably the warmest spot in the hotel today. As you can see in the pictures after a little rest and relaxation she was warmed up enough to get out and back to her day of whatever being an iguana entails.

my family (me,wife, two kids age 0 and 3) are going to Florida for four weeks in March/April. We're Europeans and it will be our second visit to the US. Our planned route is basically

1. Orlando: we land there and want to experience the theme parks and outlets for a few days
2. Tampa Bay: we plan to stay in St. Pete and enjoy the beach. Tips for the area are highly welcome! Also, is Clearwater very scientology-y or is it basically a normal town?
3. Boca Raton: I actually don't know much abbout Boca Raton so I would be thrilled to get suggestions on what to do there when traveling with little kids without breaking the bank. I read there's a music festival every second sunday of the month? Anything interesting an a third sunday?
4. The Keys: Marathon, Key West - that's the plan. Stay for a few days, relax in the sun on the beach, enjoy the caribbean flair. 
5. Miami: You can't go to Florida for the first time without going to Miami, right? Right? We plan on seeing Wynwood, the Frost Sience Museum, and of course the beach (again). What else is great with kids there?
6. The Everglades: that's actually a maybe. We're not sure if tey are suitable for such small children. Also, our older one doesn't like alligators...
7. Cape Coral: that one's non-negotiable because we meet traveling friends there. Nonetheless would we love suggestions on things to do without going bankrupt.

I know, we could / should maybe switch Miami and the Keys but this way we avoid visiting the Keys during the weekend and our hotel in Miami is much cheaper. 

So if you've got any insider tips on what to do and what to avoid we would be very thankful. Of course we read books and guides but that's nothing compared to first hand knowledge.

you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

It is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

That is unfortunate in and of itself, but my question - for anyone know might know for sure - is about eligibility for someone providing care to an elderly parent. There is a chance I might have to move to Florida to become a full-time (at my mother's house, where she lives alone) caregiver. The other options are way too expensive - like assisted living facilities which cost a fortune.

854,854,floridaman15,1580416526,ewbt28,Nan,"Long story short I came down here 4 years to visit with family and ended up staying here in the SWFL/Cape Coral/Naples area. I enjoyed and still enjoy the warmer temperatures compared to the cold I've experienced living in VA and New England. I want to stay in FL but move somewhere that makes a bit more sense for me in my early 30s.

When I moved down here I didn't choose where to go, just where there was family that could get me acclimated. I knew nothing about Florida only that it's hot, where older people retired to and it's got Disney.

I want to move up north for several reasons:

1. Smaller wealth gap, age gap. I realize this is FL so it comes with the state but if there's an area where it's less in your face everywhere you go I'd feel more comfortable. I'm college educated but lower class background but I'm from NoVA and NE so I don't have the Southern lower class thing going in the slightest and often feel out of place for it. I work but no where near being able to buy a nice house, vacation, start a family and go dining so I'd be renting a 1 bdr apartment.

2. Closer trip to family/ties in VA and New England. Not much of a difference but one thing I didn't know when I first drove down here 2k miles along the highway is that when you enter the Florida border you still have a 6 hour drive to get to Cape Coral. Being in Northern/Central florida would greatly reduce this and give access to more airport options as well.

3. East Coast. I grew up going to the East Coast for my beach vacations and would like to be closer to the open ocean again. There's something different about it from the Gulf I can't put my finger on and also the rise of flesh eating bacteria on the Gulf side has me scared.

4. Job/career/business opportunities. There's more job opportunities in the Central/NE FL areas.

5. Couple degrees cooler? Can anyone confirm this. Comparing comfort level here https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/daytona_beach_fl/naples_fl/climate there's a pretty big difference. I don't know if that's because less humidity? The avg temperatures essentially look the same so I can't tell where the difference in comfort comes from.

Requirements:

1. Still has palm trees, I know a lot of Northern FL is an extension of Georgia and there are very few or no palm trees there. Seems silly requirement but I like them.

I've thought about Orlando but the crazy 2 hour traffic to travel 30 minutes and high cost of living isn't very enticing. Which has me looking at Daytona and surrounding areas, still close to Orlando without everything that comes with it and even closer to the coast. I'm not currently a nascar fan but could see myself becoming interested in it and going to the races. I'm sure Daytona has more to offer than only racing as well, like surfing.

Any thoughts from personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",florida,"Moving from SW FL to NE Coast or Central FL, should I do it? Recommendations?"

We were planning to hire car seats but have now found out that the hire company only do harnessed seats up to 18kg which obviously won't be suitable as she's above that weight. According to the law in Florida, she can't go into a booster seat until age 4.

We then thought about getting a taxi from the airport and buying a car seat over there, but we would obviously need a car seat for the taxi journey. It seems from research that we can't take a UK seat with us as they aren't approved for use in the US.

So now we are left wondering what to do...

Are there any car seats which can be bought in the UK which are federally approved for use in the US? Or should we pay for a car seat from the US to be shipped over here and take with us? Or our final option would be to maybe get an Uber with a car seat which seems to be an option and then buy a car seat there.

Got permits and such, let everyone know where he was going to be, because that way if something is going on in an area the parks dept will know who they have to contact or make sure is safe.  Like, for instance, in case of a controlled burn.  In fact, I remember him discussing that with me over the phone from Florida, since he was having to get permits for essentially an empty area--we were wondering why the permits were necessary.  Guess that's why.

&amp;#x200B;

So I get a call today at 1pm Florida time to let me know they tried calling my BF but they can't reach him (no shit sherlocks, he's on the fucking trail right now) to let him know there's going to be a controlled burn today and tomorrow right on the trails he's going to be hiking.  So, like, be careful.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuckers!  I seriously hate people, for this reason.  They had one job.  Make sure people don't hike into areas they are going to burn.  What's the fucking point of that permitting system if they don't actually make sure people know a burn is going to be happening until the moment it happens? 

&amp;#x200B;

And you know the only thing that will prob happen?  I'll spend the day worrying.  Those fucking pieces of shit.

This massive white mastiff/pit type mix latched onto my dog’s neck and my dog started screaming bloody murder. 

The neighbor ran out and jumped on their dog and we both tried and tried to pry it off my dog. Eventually, the attacking dog let my dog go and we both ran inside. 

My question is in regards to use of force in such an instance. Would it have been legal or illegal to shoot, stab, or otherwise injure the attacking dog to get it to stop hurting my dog, who I love more than my actual family?

Also, my dad and I agree that the next time we see this dog out of their own yard and not n a leash, we’d call animal control, would animal control even care about such a call?

Every show I do this year raises money for dog rescue. We're at over $15,000 and climbing!

I am doing this because of how important my dog was to me. Walter traveled with me to 48 states, and was my constant companion on the road. So I decided to help save a few more Walters.

We donate 25% of every show and the charities I choose in each city don't know I'm doing this til after I announce it - makes it more fun that way. I will also post a screenshot of the donation afterwards to appease any skeptics.

I just wanted to confirm something and see if anyone has had any similar experience. My sister in law moved from Miami to Kansas last year with her mother and her new stepfather. Her parents are divorced and her father still lives in Florida (been living there since 1993). She absolutely hates Kansas and can’t wait to leave (no surprise) and now that she’s 16, college is entering the picture. 

She is adamant that she wants to go to school in Florida - UCF, FSU for example. Mainly, she wants to be closer to her friends and family she left behind. The thing is, she’s an average (perhaps slightly better than average) student, so she’d be relying primarily on FAFSA and some loans. 

I’ve explained to her that *IF* she wants to go to school in Florida she would need in-state tuition because her family cannot afford to pay out of state tuition. I’ve done research and I think that *IF* her father claims her as a dependent in his taxes (currently he does not) for the next 3 years, then she would qualify for residency. 

Is this correct? Is there anything else we should be aware of? 

Thank you",florida,In-state Tuition w/ Divorced Parents

He was born and raised there and my dad’s side of the family lives there so it’s not unfamiliar territory to us, but we are still struggling to find a place to live.

We’re looking at the St. Pete/ Clearwater/ Tampa area for a small place that will allow our dog for under $1,000 rent. Problem is, we’re having a hard time finding legitimate listings without being able to drive by or tour. None of our family lives close enough to the area that we could ask them to check spots out for us. We were aware there was a huge problem with scams and bogus listings, but this is getting ridiculous. It’s also tough finding places that don’t have a steep application fee, which is something that makes us both uncomfortable (again from the potential scamming perspective). We don’t need one of those fancy complexes with the pools and gym and rec rooms, in fact we’d prefer NOT to live in one of those, but that’s really the only kind of places we’re finding at the moment.

We’ve been scouring Craigslist, Zillow, and apartments.com to no avail. So my question is: what kind of advice can you give for finding honest listings from a distance? Any tips for things we should be aware of?

&amp;#x200B;

We have chosen a few spots so far..

&amp;#x200B;

St. Pete- Haven't looked into it much yet, hows the food scene? 

Fort Meyers/Naples- most intriguing for me.  We have been to Fort Meyers and loved it, kind of looking at Naples this time

The Keys-  probably our favorite, but we're not crazy about the logistics of getting from the airport to our desired spot (Duck Key).  We only have 8 days off of work.

Destin- most intriguing for her.  I just can't decide what else there is to do there.  Seems like a ""family"" destination, we don't have any kids just yet.

St. Augustine- Seems perfect for us, but we prefer beachfront, and it seems most hotels are downtown 

Clearwater- Same as Destin, seems more like a ""family"" destination

&amp;#x200B;

Usually the way I decide where to go is how the food scene is.  We love trying new food, not afraid to spend $100 per person, not afraid to go to a dive bar if it's good food.  We don't care much for super touristy spots, but as I said, we loved Fort Myers Beach (there was plenty of spots to get away from the crowd).",florida,Need some help planning a romantic couples vacation!

Do people always ask questions about why women choose to work at a strip club and expose their intimate body parts to strangers?

It turns out to be cogent reasons yes quite a lot of females opt to work because it enables them to earn more than would be otherwise possible 

and striping in Miami is hard but the pay is often in 100’s and thousands of dollars 

**Some feel that it an art**

People think that its art they might be right taking off your clothes smoothly skillfully showing off your assets and getting everyone within view painting is not easy to do and yet precisely 

**Medicated bills**   


The girls who are working as strippers it is not possible to totally avoid sickness. A hospital bill is recommended that is why they have to work for their family it is an unselfish act.

**Jobs and more Jobs** 

Yet another reason because in this industry there will be no effects on job opportunities. You can always find a job as a stripper",florida,Working At A Strip Club Why Women choose this

°I'm from Atlanta. I'm convinced there is no traffic worse than what I've experienced.

*posting for a friend in attempts to help her get her cat back. Initial event and updates 


Hello, my name is Ashley. Im from Crestview in Northwest Florida. I have a cat named ""Titania"" that is 6 months old that had come up missing last week.


This was unlike her to wander far off. I know something bad had happened. I posted listings on Facebook and flyers with no luck. I started researching online and local sites to see if she was picked up. I came across a site called ""Socks"" which stands for ""Saving Our Cats &amp;Kittens"", http://www.saveourcatsandkittens.com/ . It's a foster rehoming group for just cats. I was in complete shock to discover her photo with the new name they gave her on the site, (Gypsi). My heart sank where you could tell by looking at the picture she was confused and scared of being held in a completely different environment with strangers. I had learned through my investigation that a neighbor of mine that's two doors down is associated with ""Socks"". She helps by bringing in young cats mainly females and assisting with fostering and rehoming which she receives a cut of the money this organization makes of selling the cats to families wanting to adopt a cat. I had been informed this woman is well-known to coax the cats with food in her home. I was furious and shocked to think of a neighbor to go that low to do something like that especially knowing how much Tatiana means to me. I was informed she was involved with Tatiana's disappearance. I had left her with multiple notes on her door and had tried to contact her which she completely ignores me. The only response I have gotten from her is ""where's your proof"" then slams the door on vme. I called and received advice from other local shelters that had learned my experience to promptly have local authorities involved. I had first contacted ""Socks"" to inform them about everything that's going. Assuming they would be more than willing to assist me with knowing the new cat that they just listed is my stolen cat. I sent them emails of photos and videos of the cat. To my surprise, they were not willing to corporative. They wouldn't even allow me to even see the cat. I can tell that they know it's my cat by speaking to them, but they aren't willing to work with me in any way to have any chances of getting my cat back. That's losing profits in their eyes. I just couldn't believe they were like that based on what I read on their site about what they stand for. Then I decided to call my local police department and told them the story and shared the photos of Tatiana and me The officer was more than willing to help, especially since his daughter had her cat stolen so he was compassionate with my pain. ""Socks"" is located in the next town over from me so my local police department was unable to provide their service. They were willing to at least allow me to see the cat and its reaction to make a determination. I was advised to call the police department in the town where Socks is located but they told me their procedures are different in their district and they would not be able to get involved since it's considered a civil matter. When I called the directed of ""Socks"" that I'm going to have no choice but to have the police involved, they basically said go for it and even if the police orders us to return your cat you have to pay us $500 since it's now considered ""their"" property. Now she denies ever saying that when others address her. Now I wish I had everything recorded.  The director of Socks ""Nancy"". claiming since the cat wasn't chipped and they had chipped my cat themselves it's now considered their property. I regret now not chipping my cat. I just never never never would have ever thought I would have a situation like this in the area I lived. I had never experienced a situation like this in my life. Since the police are unable to get involved I'm now left with no other choice but to basically pay their ""ransom"" which is what it seems like. I regrettably didn't have her""Tatiana"" chipped which is what Socks is used against me. This is an insane heartbreaking mess. My perception of some people has drastically changed to think there are people, (even neighbors) And organizations out there that will do whatever it takes to make their money without giving a care. I never would have thought a neighbor would commit something like this for a few dollars. I'm furious and devastated at the same time. I had exhausted every possible measure to fight to get her back. I'm trying to raise $500 to get my baby back. I understand it's just a cat but I couldn't describe how much Tatiana means to me. I had saved her life at birth when the mother had umbilical cords wrapped around her leg losing blood flow. Our bond is so unique and precious to me. She is always there to greet me after work, follows me around everywhere I go. We are inseparable. I can't go a day &amp; night without thinking about her.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Updates as of today: I'll copy and paste discussions of what I have told others about Ashley and Tatianas current . Thursday Ashley hopes to hear a call back from Nancy on what's next.. here are the events that has led up to now....
----


**when Nancy while I agreed to let her come down to look at her cat she failed to tell her that she would have requirements that needed to be met. that wasn't brought up until she had put her to tears saying she can't have her cat so she called the sheriff when they showed up Nancy decides to make up a list if she wants the cat and told her she can't gaurentee the cat will still be there by the time she returns with everything she listed. cop said he wishes he could intervene but can't at the moment since it's consider a domestic matter but agrees that everything Nancy is doing is completely wrong but if she gives what Nancy demands and still won't give the cat up then they will get involved and take her to court. . the very next day she met every requirement Nancy demanded which Nancy probably wasn't expecting for her to get it done so quickly. so at this point she still hasn't given her decision I don't know what Nancy is planning.

**when Ashley came out to socks on Monday for the first time when Nancy finally agreed to let her see her cat it got pretty disturbing. I was furious when I heard about this. They kept the cat in the office by itself from the rest of all the other cats. I don't know what their reason is for doing that maybe to hide her from view in case ashley popped in before they were willing to let her see the cat.
Nancy and the nurse spent about five minutes in the office alone with the cat. 
Ashley said her cat appeared drunk and kinda wobbling and stumbling around and looked like it was on the verge of falling asleep. They didn't want the cat to have a reaction to when she sees her owner so it's looking like while they were in there for five minutes they were drugging her cat up with some type of sedative. when ashley came in the cat snapped out of it and was trying to break itself free from Nancy while she kept holding her cat down so it wouldn't start  to crawl to ashley.

Her cat eventually broke free from Nancys hands  and starting crawling frantically crying for Ashley. Tatiana, her cat, was at the edge of the table wanting to jump to her. That's when that Nancy stepped in and picked up the cat and told her she couldn't hold it. even their nurse had to say something like are you serious? Ashley was like your not going to tell me I can't hold my cat. she finally gave in and let her hold it. that cat was crying leaching on to just begging to stay with her. The nurse was deeply ashamed she had her down and couldn't say the word and had to leave the room.. 

the fucked up part is Nancy went to the back to  typed up some papers to where she couldn't take it at that moment. the sheriff was so disturbed and furious because he knew he couldn't do anything about it . that's when ashley called me crying about it. mardi said if you want the cat then I guess you better have those requirements in tomorrow because I'm not going to guarantee it will be there incase someone else comes along and adopts it.

the sheriff was shaking his head while taking to his partner when they went back out side with ashley and said this is a pretty messed up situation and expressed how angry he felt about Nancys attitude and actions and prays she gets that cat asap. they are willing and can legally step in if Nancy refuses to give her cat back even after all the requirements Nancy told her to do are met. sheriff said they will support her 200% in small claims court. I hope it doesn't have to go that far but whatever it takes I'm willing to do for her so she can finally get her baby back from this crooked and twisted so called pet shelter



**the officer even though we have pics and videos it's hard to do much since we don't have any paper work of ashleys name and her cat and we didn't have the cat chipped. it's like even though they know clearly it's her cat they are basically being technical about everything which I'm just so confused on why they are being like this in the first. it's a very nice looking cat so it could be all about profit. but yea the cop said if we had any type of paper work showing their names then would walk right up in there and take her cat back from socks...


**her mistake was that it she didn't have her cat chipped. she had intended to. it's about six months old. but she wasn't in a hurry we never ever would have thought a situation like this would happen. the neighbor that lives a doors down helps foster some of their cats  before they are sold out had claimed she contacted the owner and they refused to want their cat basically. Basically just made up complete bull in hopes to get away with this. we confronted her about it. she said at first she doesn't know anything about it then eventually said where's your proof and now completely avoids us now. but we will definitely call them and find out every law and see what we can do from there. I'm glad to hear you do so your very familiar about what you can and can't do. it sounds completely wrong and so confused how they are getting away with this even with having photos and videos of her and the cat as proof. Crestview police said they would get involved if socks was in Crestview. Fort Walton said they can't at this point because it's a civil matter. hopefully animal control will help us out with their info...


**exactly. well the sheriff did say if it comes down to it I could take them to court and they will have our back 100% and will do what ever it takes to get the judge to return our cat back but I'm really not wanting to take it that far but I guess we will if we have to. would that be a costly for us to do something like that? I have never taken anyone to court or have any experience being involved with something like that. do you know?..


-----I don't want anyone to say anything yet. just wait until we hear what she has to say in the morning. if she says no there is going to be some major problems I don't know what is wrong with this lady..

**I don't want to say all this in the public for Nancy to read and make things more difficult..


Hope everyone has a good idea based on my conversation. Now seeing what's going to happen tomorrow morning, Thursday. 

Thought, advice, tips, experience. Please share. I don't know what to think at this point. it's insane I can't believe this is reality. I don't know what to expect now.

Florida was once was a Democrat controlled state voting Democratic nominees for 5 years straight that stopping in 1928 when the Republican nominee Herbert Hoover won Florida. After that Florida went back to being a Democrat state until 1952 when Dwight Eisenhower won Florida. Florida voted Republican for the next 3 years, the last time that happened was in 1868 and ended in 1876. Since Eisenhower there's been a large amount of Republicans that won Florida with a few Democrats mixed in, but the last time a Democrat nominee won twice in a row was in 2008 and 2012 that being Barack Obama. Florida was one by Republican nominee Donald Trump in 2016 (currently president of the United States of America). That brings us to the current voting year of 2020 with Donald Trump being the most Likely Republican nominee and so far an indecisive Democrat nominee, that brings up the question who will win Florida this year? Honestly who knows Florida has flip flopped on both parties meaning it could be anyone's win.
Florida facts #1 Florida was won by Zachary Taylor in 1848, with his party being the Whig party, the whig party only won once in Florida.
Florida fact #2 Florida didn't vote in 1864 because they seceded from the Union (also known as the USA) but returned as a state on July 25th 1868 just in time to vote for Republican nominee Ulysses Grant.",florida,Who will win Florida this year?

&gt;“There are a lot of dissidents imprisoned in Cuba,” Cooper said to Sanders.

&gt;“That’s right. And we condemn that,” Sanders responded, before contrasting his views on authoritarianism with Trump’s. “Unlike Donald Trump — let’s be clear — I do not think that [North Korean dictator] Kim Jung Un is a good friend.

1643,1643,3SensitiveQuestions,1582704860,f9q2pr,Politics,"""I am the son of Cuban immigrants. I grew up in South Florida.

My grandfather was a political prisoner under Fidel Castro in 1961.

He passed away in 2017, and before my grandfather left us, I sat down with him to listen to his stories about his time in the prison camp.

That was a deeply emotional conversation, and a day like today makes those memories flash back into my mind. These disingenuous attacks against Bernie Sanders have been deeply offensive and hurtful, as I see these political hacks using my grandfather’s suffering and that of other political prisoners to advance their cynical political agenda. 

In an 60 Minutes interview on Sunday with Anderson Cooper where he was asked about a comment from 40 years ago, Sanders made it clear he condemned the authoritarian government and use of political prisoners, and was only commenting on the improvements of [social welfare programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Literacy_Campaign) in Cuba.

At a CNN town hall on Monday, he was asked again, and Bernie reiterated his condemnation of the Cuban government’s authoritarianism and restated his comment that a literacy program is good. His response was right again.

I’ve had it with people speaking for our Cuban-American community and simply using us as a political football to hurt Sanders, an honest and genuine candidate fighting for democracy and better living conditions for all of us. This is really just about undermining Sanders after he wiped the floor in a landslide victory in Nevada, where he won 70% of the Latino vote.

The establishment and political opponents are nervous because Sanders has won the vote in the first three states and is firmly on his way to win the nomination. The timing of these attacks make it clear that these are motivated by the fact that the rich and powerful are threatened and they believe these cheap political shots will work.

Politicians like Marco Rubio have sold out our community and built their whole career by stocking anti-Castro sentiment while voting for policies that have also hurt us. Their latest attacks are just a ploy help re-elect President Trump by fear-mongering...

...As a young Cuban American like many others growing up in the United States, we realize that politicians who have claimed to be for our community because they condemn the Cuban government, have actually never done anything to improve the standards of living of our families. They have called any programs or plans to help the working people “Socialist” or “Communist” in order to silence any sort of change. Our generation, along with other Latinos, have seen how disingenuous these politicians are while we look at the profound injustices in our society and the gross levels of wealth and income inequality that has occurred.

Growing up, we saw how hard our parents worked and struggled to give us a better life in this country, living paycheck to paycheck, and now we have an uncertain future, when we are projected to have a lower standard of living than that of our parents. We are also experiencing and increasing amount of anxiety and fear about our existence in this country as racism against our Latinx community ramps up with vicious rhetoric from Trump and his supporters, immigration policies, and violent hate crimes like the El Paso terrorist attack targeting our community.

However, even in the midst of all of it, we are given hope by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who speaks to our needs and articulates a very different future than the scary one we are headed towards. When he talks about Democratic Socialism we know it’s not the spooky Castro Communism that our family members ranted to us about over lunch and dinner as we drank our café con leche, but instead a social democracy of the likes of Finland and Denmark where everyone is guaranteed basic economic and social rights such as healthcare, education, a living wage, housing, and a strong democracy. Sanders also talks about bringing people together, no matter our race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation in a movement of compassion and solidarity.

In Bernie’s agenda, we see what our parents came looking for in United States—the American dream that they were promised but were never granted. Our generation understands this, and we realize the power we have our voices heard in the political process.

With four more years of Trump likely leading to the final death nail on American democracy, we need to unite and come together as a nation to achieve the values we profess to the world. All of these politically-motivated attacks against Bernie Sanders fall flat to me and tens of thousands of other young Cuban-Americans who realize we are no longer in the Cold War era, and that it is our turn to decide our future—one that works for all of us and not just the wealthy few.""",florida,"As a Young Cuban-American, I’m Defending Bernie Sanders (OPINION)"

1701,1701,sleepapnealpd,1582866718,fapmm8,Nan,"Loud snoring should never be ignored. It can be a signal of a severe health issue. Extreme night-time grunts and snoring can be a symptom of sleep apnea, particularly if your snore is coupled with recurring interrupted breathing that sounds like choking or gasping. It will disturb your sleep and your partner’s, and it can even bring about health issues like heart trouble. You need to visit your doctor straight away if you happen to notice such symptoms. 

https://preview.redd.it/rxy8yviellj41.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5dfef92a1ab2ad4127efc0734dad6d02cbdf594

The physician would often recommend a therapy of utilizing a device known as CPAP \[continuous positive airway pressure\] for treating sleep apnea. You need to wear a mask when you are asleep, as it blows air in your airways to ensure they are open so that you don’t experience breathing interruption and snoring. 

**Mouth exercises**

You can do some mouth exercises besides wearing this mask to help strengthen your muscles surrounding the airways. It involves swallowing and chewing motions and some particular tongue movements. When you practice these exercises for 30 minutes every day, they have been found to help reduce the sleep apnea severity, enhance your sleep and alleviate snoring trouble. Playing some instruments that help strengthen your airways like the didgeridoo has also been found to assist in the treatment of sleep apnea. 

* Push your tongue tip over the mouth roof and slide it backward. Repeat it for 20 times. 
* Suck the tongue in an upward motion. Ensure the tongue lies over the mouth roof. Repeat the exercise for 20 times. 
* Force your tongue’s back part downwards over your mouth floor while still keeping the tongue tip touching the front teeth bottom. 

If you have sleep apnea or snoring issues that interfere with your sleep, get in touch with your doctor and ask him/her whether mouth exercises are the right ones for you.

Based on true events, the film was filmed in the very inhospitable South Florida Everglades. Featuring a direct descendant of Seminole Chief Osceola as the Native American Guide. 

A band of outlaw bird poachers who live deep in the Glades are pursued by an Audubon game warden while clashing with the South Florida land developers. 

The producers wanted authenticity and it shows. Many native Floridians (non actors) were used for roles and it really is a fantastic film.

The director was fired during filming, after weeks of odd behavior seemingly related to heroin and drug use. The film was finished by the producers. This is evident during the last third of the film but I feel it adds to the intrigue of the story.

As a native Floridian, I very much appreciated a look back into the history of our state and to see how life was like before developers took over.

Mixed in with the film are some utterly gorgeous documentary style shots of the animals of the Florida Everglades in pristine condition.

I started wheezing; everytime I breath, it hurt. I’ve had bronchitis before, but this wasn’t bronchitis and I know it wasn’t. Then came sore throat, coughing and I started running a mild fever. Our eyes actually started watering up after the fever symptoms went away and we started sweating a lot, but nothing too serious.

My mother, brother, and myself all decided to self-quarantined immediately. We basically washed everything of our own separately from each other, bath in a bleach diluted bath and invested into disinfectant/germicide/virucide and so forth to use around the house and in our areas. 

We went to the hospital and they called the CDC and wanted to test and they didn’t do so and sent me home.

Neither of us don’t have the sore throat symptom anymore or the wheezing, but we still have the runny nose. We feel way better than we did three days ago, but don’t plan to risk..infecting anyone else. We took the stuff we had in our house and so forth and it actually helped. 

From what we read, it affects kids and elderly people differently than a 19 yr old, a 21 yr old and a 42 yr old. 

Before anyway asks, “How do you know its not the flu?” We got our flu shots well over two months ago and didn’t get sick or anything. Just got these symptoms three days ago, but we’re doing fine.

Just think its pretty messed up how they aren’t testing people.",florida,Florida &amp; A Lot of Other States Have People With the Coronavirus and the CDC is not allowing them to test individuals who display some symptoms. This is my story.

1746,1746,soylamulatta,1583020797,fblifi,Nan,"I just got back from the Florida Strawberry Festival today. Although my boyfriend and I had fun, we both felt as if something was missing from the whole thing - STRAWBERRIES. 

There are food stands EVERYWHERE which serve up typical fair food. Corn dogs, burgers, cheese fries, and anything they can possibly think to put on a stick (and fry of course). While this is something I would 100% expect, I felt disappointed that there was a lack of fresh food. Many stands advertise fresh squeezed juice and fresh fruit smoothies, however at one point I got to front of the line and was about to order a frozen mango smoothie when I saw the person mixing them up plop a plastic tub of a powdered form of mango on the counter. I expected more strawberry centered food items to choose from. There was ""strawberry lemonade"" that was really just powdered lemonade mix and a few pumps of concentrated strawberry syrup. While there are stands that offer strawberry shortcake, I didn't see any other did stands incorporating fresh strawberries except was a topping on funnel cakes.

I guess I was expecting too much and remembering it differently from when I went as a young kid. I thought there would be more activities based on our state's strawberry agriculture. Most of the stands seemed to be owned by the same company and there were very few stands that seemed to be run by locals. 

I suppose it's fun for kids and it's fun if your expecting a fair/carnival experience. It was very crowded, squeezing sideways through people most of the time but I'm not complaining about that, it's just a warning for anyone thinking about going who might not like crowds. Am I remembering it differently from 15 years ago or has it changed a lot?",florida,I wish the Florida Strawberry Festival had more of a focus on strawberries.

My husband and I (both 25) have recently been considering a move to a few different states (North Carolina, Texas, Florida). We currently live in Missouri, we've lived in Missouri our whole lives, and we just really would like a fresh start somewhere new with better weather. 

My older brother and his wife have lived in Dunedin for 9 years, and my parents have a condo in Safety Harbor, so I'm pretty familiar with the area. My best friend is also considering a move to the Clearwater area, so Florida has been on my mind, and I've decided to throw it into the mix of moving considerations. 

My husband and I are very outdoorsy and into hiking, going to parks, and just generally being outside. My fear with Florida is that it will be too, too hot to do outdoorsy stuff. And that there won't be opportunities to hike because of a lack of trails as well as a fear of alligators and snakes and the like. But on the other hand, maybe we could make up for the lack of hiking with things like swimming/fishing/biking?

We're both in the tech/banking industry and would likely be looking for new jobs as well. I'm a Tech Writer, and my husband is a Software Engineer. I'm also curious about the job situation in the Clearwater area.

Really, I was just curious to hear some opinions from people who aren't my family who already live there lol. Any advice would be much appreciated!",florida,Should I move to Florida? (Clearwater area)

As you can probably see from my post history, my girlfriend and I are going through a bit of a rough patch, and are looking to get our own place to pool our resources and get by.

We are right now located in the West Palm Beach area, but as you likely know, it’s a pretty expensive place to live.

We are looking for a place for us two alone, preferably with a month-to-month lease as we are still getting our footing in terms of providing for ourselves and there’s no guarantee we will be staying in one particular place long term. We don’t care about the size just that it’s in a somewhat safe area. We would be open for just a room to rent, but we would definitely need to meet the landlords first as we want to stay safe.

We have a vehicle so distance isn’t an issue, although we would prefer to stay on the east side of Florida.

Dolphins a lot of great history and things seem to be turning for them, they're probably one of the few that are represented well and have decent support even though mediocrity.

Panthers, Rays, Marlins are just pathetic. Not sure about Ray games but the other two are basically free to get in. Panthers haven't won a playoff series in like 25 years.

Lightning get a lot of support they're fine. Same with the Heat, have had some mediocre seasons but South Florida supports this team usually.

This is one of the most beloved animals on the planet… sea turtles.  Discussions and debates over all sorts of local issues occur but when sea turtles enter the discussion, most agree – “we like sea turtles”, “we have nothing against sea turtles”.  There are nonprofit groups, professional hospitals, and special rescue centers, devoted to helping them. I think everyone would agree, seeing one swimming near the shore, or nesting, is one of the most exciting things they will ever see.  For folks visiting our beaches, seeing the white sand and emerald green waters is amazing, but it takes their visit to a whole other level if they encounter a sea turtle. 

They are one of the older members of the living reptiles dating back 150 million years.  Not only are they one of the largest members of the reptile group, but they are also some of the largest marine animals we encounter in the Gulf of Mexico.

I've witnessed family and friends run into a number of issues while trying to vote over the past few years, and even though I've been voting in Florida for over a decade now, I wasn't always sure of how to solve their problems. So I looked up the answers to my questions, and I'm compiling the basics here in hopes that I can maybe help some of you out.

(please be patient if the formatting is weird, the preview is looking a little funny &amp; I'll edit after posting if needed)

I'm no expert, but I'm willing to try to assist in finding any answers you may need. Let me know if you have questions or corrections. I recommend double-checking info with [your county's Supervisor of Elections](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/) just to be safe. Most of the information in this guide comes from the [Florida Division of Elections](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/), with some cross-checking and supplemental info from several Florida counties' voting guidelines and poll workers, as well as [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page) and Wikipedia wherever I've linked them.

For Spanish speakers, there's a [voting guide available at this link](https://www.dos.myflorida.com/media/699607/voter-registration-guide-spanish.pdf). Florida's Voter Assistance Hotline (1-866-308-6739) can also help.

**Stuff You Probably Already Know**
Florida is having a [Presidential Preference Primary election](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/quick-facts-presidential-preference-primary/) on March 17, 2020. This means Florida's major political parties (Democrat and Republican) are choosing the presidential candidate they want to represent their party on the ballot this November.

**Who Can Vote**
You need to be registered to vote in the state of Florida, and you need to be affiliated with a major party. [Click here to look up your current registration info.](https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus)

Democrats can vote in the Democratic primary, Republicans can vote in the Republican primary. Florida has [closed primaries](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voter-registration/closed-primary-party-affiliation/), so (barring certain local elections) you can only vote in your own party's election. Independents will not be able to vote for a presidential candidate in this primary.

If you're a 17-year-old who will turn 18 before the general election (November 3, 2020), you can participate in this primary as long as you've pre-registered to vote!

**When &amp; Where You Can Vote - Early Voting**
Early voting is open now in every county and will remain open until at least Saturday, March 14. (Some locations may be open on the 15th &amp; 16th as well, but many aren't.) You can vote at any early voting location in your county. [Here's a list of all locations &amp; operating hours in the state.](https://dos.myflorida.com/media/702721/2020-early-voting-locations-and-times-master-20200302.pdf)

I strongly recommend early voting! The polling places tend to be centrally located and the lines tend to be short. I voted on 3/8 and had maybe a thirty second wait. It's great if you're anxious or new to the process because you'll be able to take your time and ask questions if you need.

**When &amp; Where You Can Vote - On Election Day**
On election day (Tuesday, March 17) the polls will be open from 7am to 7pm. **Everyone who is in line by 7pm will be allowed to vote**, no matter how long the line is or how much time it takes.

Whereas early voting can take place in many locations, you should vote at your designated polling place in your precinct on election day if at all possible. This will be a public place near the address you listed on your voter registration. [Find your polling place here](https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus).

If you can't get to your designated polling place for any reason, you can still vote. Scroll to the section below titled Voting While Away From Home.

**When &amp; Where You Can Vote - Absentee/Vote-By-Mail**
You can request a vote-by-mail ballot from [your county's Supervisor of Elections](http://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/). We're past the deadline to request that a ballot be mailed to you for this election, but you may be able to arrange to pick one up in person. There are also some [special circumstances for military and overseas voters](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/military-and-overseas-citizens-voting/).

If you already have your vote-by-mail ballot, it must be received by your county's Supervisor of Elections by 7pm on election day (3/17) to be counted. Send it out ASAP to be as safe as possible! You can check your ballot's status [here](https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus). 

If you requested a ballot but decide not to mail it, bring it to the polls with you. You can drop off your filled-out ballot there, or turn in your blank ballot and vote in person instead. If you've lost or forgotten your ballot, or if you mailed it but believe it won't arrive in time to be counted,  **you can still vote!** You may be asked to fill out a provisional ballot, which basically means that they'll check to be sure you've only voted once before counting your vote. [Click here to learn more about voting by mail](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/vote-by-mail/).

**What's On The Ballot?**
[You can find a list of the candidates that will appear on your ballot here](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_in_Florida,_2020). Note that several of these candidates have dropped out of the race. You can find a list of the [Republican candidates currently in the running here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries#Declared_major_candidates) and the [Democratic candidates here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Active_candidates).

There were no other elections on my ballot, but it's possible that you may see candidates running for local office on yours. [You can look up a local sample ballot here.](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Sample_Ballot) Anything you don't want to vote for can be left blank.

**What To Bring (And Not Bring) To Your Polling Place**

Bring a valid photo ID with your signature on it if at all possible. In Florida, **you are still legally allowed to vote without showing ID**, but you will be asked to fill out a provisional ballot, which means your eligibility will be double-checked before your vote is counted.

You CAN wear shirts, buttons, etc featuring your favorite candidate to the polls in Florida. However, you may not do anything that could be considered campaigning within 150 feet of polling places, so it's best to avoid bringing signs, leaflets, and so on past that point. At the location where I voted last weekend, there was a sign indicating the 150 foot mark.

As of this year, [it's ok to take a picture of your completed ballot](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/politics/2020/01/22/heres-how-the-primary-election-is-changing-in-florida-in-2020/) in Florida! You still can't take any other type of photograph at your polling place, though - no selfies with your ballot, no photos of friends voting. 

It's fine to use your phone for anything aside from photos, just keep the volume off to avoid disturbing other voters. You are allowed to use your phone (or notes, or a sample ballot, etc) to help with marking your ballot in the photo booth - so if you need to do some quick last minute research on an unfamiliar candidate, that's ok.

It's ok to bring your kids along! As long as they're able to wait in line without being disruptive, kids can come into the voting booth with you. Some counties even have sample ballots kids can fill out to practice voting.

Disabled voters who need assistance at the polls can bring along a person of your choice to help. While polling places are legally required to be accessible, I would recommend that you contact your Supervisor of Elections in advance to be 100% sure your needs can be met in your precinct. [More info on voting with a disability here.](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/accessible-voting-for-persons-with-disabilities/)

**What Is It Like To Vote?**
Speaking as someone who's pretty anxious about new situations, especially when I don't know what to expect - in my experience it's been easy and low-stress, and the worst problem I've ever faced was a longish line. I didn't turn up any videos on voting in Florida with a quick search, but if you're looking for an overview of what's involved, [this video of the voting process at a Tennessee polling place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVkIsLyaz6w) is very similar to what I've experienced.

If you have any questions at all, no matter how silly they may seem, ask away!

**Voting While Away From Home**
If you're registered to vote in Florida but will not be in Florida for early voting or election day, vote-by-mail is your only option that I know of. If you're in Florida but away from the city or county where you're registered, you have several options.

You can change the address on your voter registration at any time, even on election day. [Click here to do so](https://registertovoteflorida.gov/home). **You are legally allowed to vote even if the address on your ID doesn't match the address on your voter registration.** If you're in college, for example, you can use your current address on your voter registration even if your driver's license still shows your parents' address. 

**The purpose of showing ID is to verify your identity, not your address. If a poll worker tells you that the address on your ID makes you ineligible to vote, they are wrong.** 

If you're away from home but don't have a local address you can use, you can vote without changing your address. If you're in a county other than the one where you're registered, you can vote using a provisional ballot (meaning your eligibility will be verified before your vote is counted). 

If you're in the correct county but in the wrong precinct you can also use a provisional ballot, [but your vote may not be counted](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/contacts/frequently-asked-questions/faq-voting/). (I haven't yet been able to figure out exactly why this might happen.) It's best to get to your assigned polling place if possible - jump to the next section for suggestions. 

**Help Getting To The Polls**
Vote early if you anticipate having any transportation issues! You can do so at [any early voting location in your county](https://dos.myflorida.com/media/702721/2020-early-voting-locations-and-times-master-20200302.pdf), and these locations may well be more easily accessible via public transportation than your assigned polling place.

If you aren't able to vote early and need help getting to your polling place, Lyft is partnering with nonprofit organizations to give some voters free or discounted rides. [Consider reaching out to one of the organizations listed here for help.](https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/expanding-voting-access-in-2020) If you aren't eligible for this assistance, [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/promo-coupon-code-free-rides) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/promo/) also provide some decent discounts to new users. 

As far as I know, no current campaign is able to offer official help in this area, but local volunteers are sometimes able to organize carpools and rides. Check your preferred campaign's list of events near you - and if you don't see anything, consider reaching out to volunteers or political organizations in your area to see if they can connect you with any resources. 

You can find (both official and volunteer organized) campaign events for [Bernie Sanders here](https://map.berniesanders.com/) and for [Joe Biden here](https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/). (Consider volunteering for your favorite candidate too - it's easier and more fun than you might think!)

**If You're Not Eligible To Vote In This Election...**
Don't be discouraged. You can still volunteer, encourage others to vote, and get a head start on preparing for next time. 

Florida is having another primary election to select candidates to serve in the House of Representatives on August 18 (check out current [Republican candidates here](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_elections_in_Florida,_2020_(August_18_Republican_primaries) &amp; [Democratic candidates here](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_elections_in_Florida,_2020_(August_18_Democratic_primaries)), and the general election where we'll vote on candidates chosen in both primaries is coming up on November 3. [If you aren't registered to vote, or if you want to change your party affiliation, click here to do so now](https://registertovoteflorida.gov/home) so you're ready to go when the time comes! If you're at least 16 years old, you can pre-register now so you'll be eligible to vote once you turn 18.

If you are homeless, you are still legally allowed to register. Check with your county to be sure, but you may be able to use the address of a shelter, church, post office, or even a public place like a park on your voter registration.

If you're ineligible to vote due to felon disenfranchisement, you're not alone. [Florida has the highest rate of disenfranchisement in the country, affecting more than 10% of our population.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felon_disenfranchisement_in_Florida) To find out if you can restore your voting rights, start by contacting the [Florida Commission on Offender Review](https://www.fcor.state.fl.us/clemencyOverview.shtml). The [ACLU of Florida](https://www.aclufl.org/en/restore-your-rights) may also be able to help you out.


**TL;DR:** If you're registered to vote in Florida, affiliated with a major party, and currently located in Florida, odds are you **WILL** be able to vote in the March 17 election! Even if you're away from home, even if you don't have your ID on you - get out to the polls and try. If your eligibility can't be confirmed, ask to fill out a provisional ballot (and find out what you need to do to be able to cast a regular ballot next time).

Voting matters. [There's no shortage of elections that have been decided by a fraction of a percentage, or a handful of votes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results) If you were around for the 2000 presidential election, you know that for sure.

I'm Florida-grown and I'm moving away very shortly after. I am not planning on a going away party so I want to make my birthday a silly event for my close friends/family that have an equally weird sense of humor. I know I'm probably too old for themed birthday parties, but *who cares*, it's my birthday and I want to have a Florida themed party. Idk what the hell that entails though. 

  
 I was trying to think of ""florida themed"" things to eat and do, Such as Publix Subs, Orange Juice, Key Lime Pie for Cake, maybe go to the beach or go on the boat, and end the night bar hopping local breweries ( I looked up Fl things to do and apparently breweries aren't something most states have a lot of?) and trying local beers and maybe a Hurricane or two. What other signature Florida things are there to do? Forget how to drive? Maybe dress up as old people and play bingo? I'm really struggling and am more than open to suggestions!

  
I wish I could make it crazier but I can't think of other funky ""Florida"" things to do??",florida,Trying to have the most ridiculous 21st birthday ever. Suggestions?

But my retail store has something called ""meal violation"" if you work longer than 5 hours, you must take a 30 minute break.  So...is there some law I'm not seeing?

I ask because, I'd rather work 6 hours before requiring a 30 minute break.

I have a husband who is a stay at home dad to two elementary aged boys. We have a family friend who lives in Jacksonville and is trying to convince us to move there... but to be honest, it seems like FM in Florida sucks- everyone I’ve talked to seems like they only see adults and even if the population is younger, people go to pediatricians. 
I trained for rural FM and would love to continue to see newborns on up. I probably will need to be in a town of 20,000-80,000 - small enough that I’m not fighting for pediatric patients with large practices but big enough to support families, etc.

Mental health laws and procedures and protocols that didn't help a women like me 


The law states that the only people who have the right to determine whether a person should be observed 72 hour holds the police have documented that I have been a baker act since the first time I brought myself to the hospital voluntarily. My doctor can confirm that I went and asked for help bc I had PTSD flashes I never had before since then I it was documented and I was no matter what sent to the emergency room where I wasn't seen by anyone until on the unit where I didn't need to be bc I was high or even if I felt that I would get better help in the hospital .They don't put me on my medication I need anyway so they don't treat me for anything .

Then, I went to treatment, where I didn't get the medication I needed again plus the doctors see you 5 minutes a week if your lucky and they diagnosed me with major depressionsymptoms which even my therapist said to the doctor what are we talking about the same person ? my therapist said to him are u talking about the same stephanie wachman because she is not depressed and I have years and years of documentations that provide back that it never has been a problem with me before but they wanted to treat me for these things they don't know anything about me.

I then was given three shots of medication to sedate me one is enough 3 at once when I didn't need to get medical attention I needed help with abuse from REAL life issues .


I hope you know that I haven't seen in three years and I don't tell anyone where I live i called them up and the asked where I was and I told them I don't give out my home and she told me where I was and then called my father bc he doesn't listen to me anymore because he doesn't remember that I was a Gov. employee for years and I know how to make sure that HIPAA and medical records are correctly are written they then don't treat me like a person who experiences mental illness and substance abuse

Even the paper work is in correct I had a ticket for speeding and when the court date was sent it said stealing 

I called up and the REAL reason was driving aggressively but still the courts put me on probation for speeding and they charged me like 600$ in fees which how do I live on ssd's and pay these bills

I was planning on visiting florida 3/26 to 3/29, just for a weekend. I hadn't decided where exactly or bought tickets/Airbnb's etc yet. I live in New England. I'd still like to go but a lot has happened the last few days, as I'm sure everyone is aware. Lifes gettin kinda weird.

I mostly just want to go to the beach, maybe kayak, hike and see some wildlife and eat some good food and maybe go to a bar one night.

 I know this is vague but I'm looking for advice if the virus may affect my ability to do these things. Since I'm not planning on going to a large event or Disney etc (which I saw is shutting down) I just have a few questions,

1. Is it an ok idea to still go to FL with everything going on? Are there areas I should avoid? 
2. Where would you suggest in FL to go? What's your favorite part/things to do and see?

They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

I hope all responses will actually cite a source or share sub rules many may not know about. Does Florida still issue a part time resident drivers licenses or regular drivers license without surrendering a previous states drivers license? At one point in time it was possible to posses a Florida Drivers license and another state's, I guess this was done away with in 2009 because the ID would state ""Valid in Florida only"".

I work for as a server for a Flanigan's location in South Florida. Today (St. Patrick's day) is our biggest event of the year. We typically see 200 people at a time in the restaurant during prior holidays and are at full capacity for 6-8 hours. Simple math says that 1000 people or so will come in close contact over the course of the day.

I spoke up, but they won't change their plans. In fact, they are encouraging all employees to come in and work. In fact, in a management email they urged locations to ""keep everyone working.""

South Florida is a massive retirement community.

I was wondering if anybody knew about asking the city to cut down trees. Out of everyone in my development, we're the only ones who have trees hanging over our backyard fence and dropping leaves into our pool. Our neighbor's pool is flawless, not one leaf.

The leaves, other than looking terrible, are clogging our pool filter and vacuum and I have to go out there every few hours to unclog it manually. We pay someone to clean the bottom once a week and it gets costly. It's just such an unnecessary added cost to maintaining our backyard when nobody else has to do this but us. And we have to spend at least an hour each week sweeping the deck and picking up the leaves, as we don't have grass in our backyard.

We did cut down the branches closest to our fence but the trees are so big, it didn't even help.

Any advice?",florida,Can I ask the city to cut down trees causing leaves to fall in my pool?

We are academic researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and would like to invite you to **participate in our research study in return for scientifically valid personality feedback.**

In the last few decades, psychologists have rigorously developed empirical tests that assess the core aspects of personality. **You will receive scientifically valid feedback about your personality after taking this short survey (less than 5 minutes).** The feedback will be customized to your responses using the scores of thousands of people who have participated so far.

The test is non-commercial, entirely free, and as anonymous as possible. And, you will have our gratitude—this research is not possible without the help of people like you!

\*As a quick aside, we know that there are communities for survey-takers (e.g., [r/SampleSize](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/)); however, sampling only groups that are designed for survey-takers would introduce sampling bias and threaten the validity of any results.

I am waiting for my house to be built here in Florida. The majority of the other people here are Canadians. None of them want to leave until “their visas expire”, “the rental month” is over, and the “weather is too nice to leave for winter weather”. 

I am concerned for all these people for whom Coronavirus care is not a part of their temporary health insurance policies (no one seems to know) and if I’m being perfectly honest, according to them “Canadians have the best free healthcare in the world”.

Right now there are over 100 Canadians still here in this little community. Should Coronavirus hit us hard, the shortage of medical care will be devastating. There’s not enough room in our hospitals for us...let alone our visitors and tourists. Since businesses aren’t closing and restaurants are still in full swing here in Central Florida, there’s no sense of urgency for the tsunami that’s coming in 11 days or so...which is when their “monthly lease” almost runs out.

I urge local lawmakers to tell our tourists, “Thanks for coming and see you next winter!”",florida,"Canada, your Prime Minister told you it’s time to come home days ago - there’s a reason for this. It’s time to leave!!!!!"

The cost of living in Florida along with the cost of literally everything has increased exponentially in that time. However, the $275.00 a week unemployment rate  has never changed. Given the recent push to a $15.00hr living wage, the $8.46hr FL minimum wage How can the state of Florida get away with paying $6.46hr before Federal Taxes? We are in a global pandemic and with that there is the prospect that 1000s of Floridians will be unemployed. How can this be allowed to continue? How can any human being in Florida and especially S. Florida afford to eat let alone survive and pay bills on the meager $275.00 a week? This is a travesty and should have been addressed long ago, but it needs to be addressed NOW! 

Thankfully, I am gainfully employed. However, I have been there myself and given the circumstances and number of people that will be affected I just cannot imagine having to live on this pittence.

Notes:

* The victim was found in a steamer trunk in a wooded area in view of a busy restaurant parking lot of The Oyster Bar.
* She had been wrapped in plastic with masking tape.
* The Trunk was manufactured by Nonbreakable Trunk Company and was 35 ½  x 16 ½  x 20 ¼. The plain black steamer or foot locker was new.
* She had brown to black hair, about 8-10 inches long, in bobby pins.
* She had brown eyes.
* She had given birth to at least one child but not in recent year.
* She suffered from a mild gallbladder disorder.
* She had 3 small hairless moles: one on the left cheek of her face, one on her right forearms, and one on her left thigh.
* She did not have any tattoos, scars, and her ears were not pierced.
* She had well kept and clean fingernails.
* She possibly had small, partial, upper front plate for four missing teeth. She had poor dental hygiene. Her teeth appeared crowded.
* She was wearing the top part of a green “shortie” type nightgown with a floral design and lace at the top.
* Near the body was also found a red or maroon, approximately 20 inch, Bolo tie cord wrapped around her neck at one to two times.
* Chemical isotope testing indicated she was not native to Florida. The tests showed she was likely born in the Southeastern part of the country and lived in the northern Southeastern states for several years preceding her death.

2624,2624,FloridaMJ420,1584708176,fludxi,☣️ CORONAVIRUS/COVID-19 ☣️,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about closing beaches and how that would work.

The main focus of beach closures should be the beaches in front of all the beachfront condos and hotels which become packed like a sardine can with tourists each day. Those tourists generally leave the beach and attend other entertainment and I would guess a majority of them eat out at restaurants or fast food for many of their meals. They definitely spend a lot of time shopping in Wal Mart, grocery stores, and local shops.

So you have these huge groups of tourists intermingling and mixing together and then with us locals in the stores and restaurants. This is like a supercharged engine for spreading a virus.

Can you close down every inch of beach in Florida? No. But we are not really that concerned with someone who drives 20 minutes outside of town to go stroll on a deserted beach. They are not that much of a danger. It is the huge dense groups of tourists who move around in flocks intermingling with locals in our community that need to be stopped NOW.

If people from out of state see announcements that all of the beaches are closed down, they will start cancelling. I would guess that only a very small percentage of tourists are determined enough to book a vacation where they will have to travel to an out of the way beach access outside of town just to have a day at the beach. The vast majority of tourists stay very close to the beach they will be enjoying on their vacation and a large amount of those prefer walking distance.

Here, for instance, the sheriff's department patrols up and down the beach all day in SUVs behind all the high rise condos. They do this every year as a matter of course. If the beaches are closed and tourists start ending up in jail the majority of the problem will solve itself fairly quickly.

2695,2695,rayraywill99,1584790981,fmdqsq,Nan,"Publix has issued a policy that bans employees from wearing medical masks to protect themselves from COVID. From what I gather, this isn't an old policy that was grandfathered in -- the administration actively came to this decision during the middle of this pandemic. An employee on another subreddit commented, ""I tried contacting OSHA and they said while it is immoral, it is not illegal.""

My  dad is a Publix cashier in the most infected county in Florida.  He is  in his 70s and has severe cardiovascular disease. I've tried to get him  to take time off, but he doesn't have the money to. I have begged him to  let me help him out for a few months but he is adamant that he won't  take ""handouts"" from his kids. I've suggested he try to get a position  like stocking where he has less customer contact, but he says the  manager likes him at the register.

I  told him he should wear one of his medical masks to work. He has about a  100 of them that he bought a while back for a time just like this. I  work as a medical provider and we're putting these same masks on both  ourselves and on patients when they have a fever/cough. I, unlike him,  have the luxury of medical assistants who will call and prescreen every  person I interact with.

Unfortunately,  Publix has made a strict policy that employees can't wear protective  masks to keep themselves from getting infected. Getting infected for my  dad means having a pretty substantial risk of dying. It also means  breathing COVID viral particles on a hundred people a day before he  becomes symptomatic. While other companies are bending over backwards to  protect their employees as well as their customers, Publix's leadership  has made a decision to do the exact opposite.",florida,XPost: Publix bans employees from wearing medical masks

They need to stop this hysteria nonsense. Unlock the beaches, open all the bars up and wait this shit out. This is exactly like the flu idk why we don't quarantine when the flu goes around.

From the most read newspaper in Florida. No paywall for virus stories

Governor needs to close all nonessential businesses and people need to stay in their homes. My wife and I started prepping in early February and have been at home exclusively for over 3 weeks.  Did go for a nice drive yesterday but did not get out of car.

Florida is 3rd largest state but has not followed lead of NY and CA.  This will be a disaster within a week.  FL needs a governor like Cuomo  or Newsome who are very proactive.  This is not a political issue or even a 2 week ordeal.  For many Floridians it is a matter of life or death or having irreversible lung damage. It affects the older persons and even the  invincible younger ones. This is not the flu  but rather a horrible disease. 

 Publix and Trader Joe's are not permitting checkout people to wear gloves or masks because it will make customers scared.  Are they kidding.  Checkout people see hundreds of customers a day and  handle cash and  groceries.  China was burning cash to stop the spread of the virus.

I work for local county government in the permitting department. On Friday we shut our doors to the general public. However, the commissioners are still requiring employees to come into the office. I am one of the lucky ones. I was picked to work from home, for the first two weeks that is. We are going on a rotation. Anyhow, there is absolutely no reason why everyone should not be able to work from home.

We started medically screening everyone entering the building this past Thursday. Many where sent home due to either a fever, coughing, being around 250 people in the last 2 weeks or traveling. Friday, the sent even more people home, people that where there on Thursday, not to mention earlier in the week. That means everyone was potentially exposed, anyway. 

Oh, and one of our inspectors was isolated earlier in the week because he was potentially exposed. His wife shared the same doctor's room with the first confirmed case in our county. He was at our employee appreciation handling food and some props used for games we had set up. So, needless to say, there is growing concern about the reason why employees still have to come in.

This brings me to my wife. She is a manager at OneBlood, our regional blood center. They are on the front lines. However, most of her work can be done from home. OneBlood refuses to allow them to work from home. Mike Rodgers, one of the big whigs ups there, stated that everyone was going to catch it anyway, so all hands on deck. I bet him and the others are sitting around in the safe and isolated spots. 

We have two small children who are now out of school because of the shutdown (which I am all for, by the way). Our 5 year old son just finished a really bad 2 week battle with a nasty type A flu. He is still on breathing treatments, so I believe he would not fair well if we were to bring the Coronavirus home. And, of course do not want to run the risk of our daughter getting it, either. 

What can we do, though? If my wife doesn't go in, she stands the chance of losing her job and the same goes with me once my two week rotation is up. It is ridiculous that we haven't shut everything down. It is like our governments and our jobs are not taking this seriously. They are toying with life and death in the name of stock markets and profit. It is insane and I am going crazy because I feel there is nothing we can do. 

I am sorry, but I had to find an outlet somewhere. Are there any of you in a similar predicament?

Thank you in advance for your time and responses.",florida,OneBlood is not allowing employees to work from home.

This is happening in Jacksonville / Duval County

I’m writing in regards to the unethical business practices conducted by my former boss/client.

I was hired on as a 1099 contractor at this software firm as a junior developer.

I quickly discovered that my employer was misclassifying me as a contractor to not have to pay taxes or provide benefits, even though he was treating me in a way a W2 employee would (I am pursuing legal representation for this issue)

With the executive order issued by mayor Curry that was effective Tuesday morning, I emailed my boss and said that I would be working remotely to avoid fines for either myself or his business, and I’d be more than happy to correspond over email or video chat to continue projects.

He terminated me immediately.

Even ignoring the extreme unethical practices he is conducting, both in regards to tax avoidance and the executive order being ignored by him, he is even breaking my contract by terminating me immediately when my contract stipulates a written two-week notice that must be paid for by the employer if a termination is pursued.

He has refused to pay me or let me work for the last two weeks.

Does anyone have any advice? I’ve reached out to some lawyers but the consultation fee is expensive and most pro-bono firms seem to have a waiting List :/

Her mom gets home at around 6pm, and that's when she takes over and makes my girlfriend begin to make dinner for the family. Her mom has taken control of my girlfriends OBGYN appointments, making them joint sessions. The first appointment, when it was our turn; we asked questions. Her mom didn't like that and said verbatim, ""I appreciate you guys wanting to be involved, but let me do the talking."", she also told me I wasn't allowed to ask questions. Fast forward a bit, my girlfriends about 26 weeks. We decide that we want to have our own individual appointments. We even refer to statute 743.065 and her mom says, ""...I don't care about the fucking statute, I will schedule her appointments.."" pretty much saying that she will do it on her time even though I have to drive 2 hours to be there. Her mom also made it clear that she ""wouldn't watch my girlfriends kid, and she's got her messed up if she thinks she's gonna"". Despite all of the stress, I have been to every single one of my girlfriends appointments even though her mom has tried her hardest to make it so that I'm not ""allowed"". My girlfriend has stayed over a few nights before, she has a great relationship with my mom. She wants to move in. She doesn't have a job. In the present, she is 15. I am 17, about to graduate highschool. Our daughter is due in June after I graduate. We don't wanna do this separate, but her mom is not giving us a choice. Is there any legal way she can leave? Feel free to ask any questions about something, so that I can elaborate. I've left ALOT out because it's beginning to be too much to type. If you're in family law or have any experience with this, please, please, give me some advice.

Also, this is my nuclear option in regards to emancipation; I have a good amount of money in a trust from suing my school board because I was abused by teachers when I was younger. Can I put that in a bank account in her name to prove in court that she can financially support herself, would this be legally sufficient?",florida,(Florida)I need actual legal options on what me and my girlfriend can do in our situation.

Can someone explain to me how the unemployment process works in Florida? I am a recent grad into the workforce and don't fully understand. I saw that the max cap is 275$ per week, and is calculated by your previous earnings. With the coronavirus stimulus plan, the government is also adding an additional +600$ a week, for four months. So in theory, can a worker who gets laid off or forloughed be earning 875$ a week or close to it? x4 is 3,500$ a month and x4 months is 14,000$? 

That is currently exponentially more than I make in a month, as I am technically still ""employed"" but am being forced to use my PTO to cover me being out of work right now. Is this too good to be true for those who are currently facing unemployment? Do these people who qualify have to pay any of this back? If not, how is this being paid for exactly?

At the same time I can only self quarantine out of fear for family and personal safety for so long without a check. But I guess that's the idea behind it? Make it hard to get unemployment/government assistance so they can squeeze as much out of you during a pandemic?

Seems like a huge backlog and the line will only get longer. My main worry is I file the claim and then because the national emergency aid package hasn't kicked in yet it gets declined, because Florida. If it reaches my employer before they close business, furlough the workers and THEY are forced to pay the uninsurance then I know they would find a way to fire me because Florida is right-to-work. I filed partial unemployment on an employer a few years ago because they reduced my hours so low I couldn't meet bills and they eventually found a way to fire me. Like, I didn't even know it was billed to the employer? I thought the government pays that.

I also just can't ask them because they would think I'm lazy and find a way to fire me before I even file. I want to keep a good rapport in case I continue working for them after, which is very likely.

But now with this new stimulus bill they will be adding $600/week on top of that $275, so we would be pretty comfortable living off that until we can return to work.

 My question is, if I accept a job making significantly less than I was making before would I still qualify for partial unemployment?  Would it be better to just stay home until we can return to work?

I’m a nurse in the Fort Walton/Destin area and my husband is active duty military - we have two toddlers. So husband was supposed to deploy beginning of April. The plan was to move out of our current house while he is gone for a few months while I move with family out of state. Well with the coronavirus going on, his deployment has been cancelled. We found out only this week. 

Our problem is, our lease is still ending on the 31st. We are absolutely stressed trying to find a place to live for the next couple months while we get our ducks in a row to buy a house. A hotel for a month is just too expensive and anything we’ve found on AirBnB is a little above what we can afford. We are paying for a storage unit until we find a house. 

Does anyone know of affordable places to live for at least the whole month of April? We are absolutely desperate at this point. With the cost of the storage unit, our price range for the month is $1,000-$1,400 for the month.

**The County issued an order on March 26 strongly suggesting that county residents stay in their homes, unless they were engaging in essential activities. (Name) College's work is essential**. The reason private colleges are specifically mentioned, while public colleges are not is due to the limited jurisdiction that  (Name)County has on the College itself. (Name) College has a unique constitution under Florida law as its own political subdivision of the state. While (Name) College is primarily self-governing as a political subdivision of the state of Florida, we heavily consider guidance from the Governor and the Department of Education, among others, in order to make decisions about operations such as the remote and on-site work of our employees.

Thus, (Name) College will continue to serve students in this remote learning environment. The county's order does not impede (Name) College's ability to provide services by appointment to support students at identified locations, which is still essential to ensure academic continuity.  

(Name) College encourages all its students and employees to maintain social distancing practices and follow the guidance from the county about personal activities.

Hello.  I’m currently working part time in a Florida Hospital/Nursing Home as an Activities Coordinator.  It’s my only source of income as I also take care of an elderly family member.  

I get checked (temperature) before entering my facility and they just started doing random temperature checks for both staff and residents during shifts.  I feel lucky I haven’t gotten sick or shown any symptoms yet but my biggest concern at this time is being a carrier and infecting all the residents I care about at my job as well as my mom that I take care of.

Our state’s governor hasn’t shut the state down and left it in the hands of the counties.  My county delayed the vote for Shelter in Place 5 days and is reconvening next week.  

I’m afraid to tell my employer that my job isn’t essential during this pandemic and I’m possibly putting the nursing home residents at risk every time I need to go to the grocery store or stop to put gas in my car.

I’m unfamiliar with unemployment and how it works.  At this point I doubt I’ll be furloughed and I don’t think I’ll qualify for unemployment if I just stop working.  I’m only part time and don’t have vacation or sick days to use.  

I have a financial obligation towards my mom and want to work but I feel like I have an ethical obligation to all the elderly residents I try to bring smiles and enjoyment to at my job.  I don’t want to be the cause of anyone’s suffering. 

Is any one else in a similar position?  Any insight on potential options would be appreciated.",florida,Question about unemployment

Hey reddit! Hope y’all are staying safe. I spent the good part of this past week building a website ([dothyhaveit.com](http://dothyhaveit.com/)). It lets you **search across major retailers** like Walmart, target, etc. and get the **inventory for the item** you’re looking for. As of now, you’ll be able to search for products in Walmart and Target. 

The other day, I had to go to a couple of different stores to find a jug milk.  This only increases the risk of you getting exposed significantly, and realized it’d be so much better if I could check for it beforehand. Social distancing is how you **flatten the curve**. With the website, you could see if it available before you go on your grocery run. Visit that one store instead of many. 

Please feel free to send me a message if you have a question, suggestion, etc. 

Disclaimer: With Walmart, the stocks are either not updated in real time, or they just don’t maintain it. I’m not certain at this point.

The parental consent bill for minors seeking an abortion passed both the House and Senate. 

HB7067 expanded school vouchers but did little to nothing to level the playing field of accountability between voucher schools and traditional public schools.

The Legislature also found time to impose more restrictions on citizens’ ballot initiatives, making it more onerous for Floridians to amend their Constitution.

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Although the media started to broadcast that the law included unemployment benefits for self-employed individuals whom have lost their job of $600 weekly for 4 months, jumping the horse as they always do, careful reading of the text shows that it may not be so black and white. It seems that states may need to ""Opt-in"" and make agreements with the Federal Department of Labor to provide the assistance funds. Florida has a bad record of accepting federal assistance and instead allowing it all to go to other states which already have wide and plentiful assistance programs, while allowing its residents to be left out in the rain. As Governor DeSantis has himself stated, Florida residents require emergency assistance in this time as they have been effectively prohibited from earning a living on their own. Businesses have been forced, by government order, to shut down and therefore not pay their workers. These workers in turn have liabilities they must respond for such as rent, mortgages, bills, loan payments, not to mention food, healthcare, medicine, etc, etc etc. In this unprecedented time, when the government has, for better or for worse, caused the sudden spike in unemployment, it would behoove the State of Florida to provide assistance to the individuals affected by these closures. Florida has previously denied medicaid expansion and other federal assistance offered to it. Let's not allow our representatives to do the same once more with this bipartisan law supported by the whole of congress and the President of the U.S. for the good of the American people during this crisis. My analysis is below:

Section 2101 states the title ""Relief for Workers Affected by Coronavirus Act""

Section 2102 states:

    (3) COVERED INDIVIDUAL.—The term “covered individual”—

    (A) means an individual who—
    (II) is self-employed, is seeking part-time employment, does not have sufficient work history, or otherwise would not qualify for regular unemployment or extended benefits under State or Federal law or pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under section 2107 and meets the requirements of subclause (I); and

    (4) SECRETARY.—The term “Secretary” means the Secretary of Labor.

So we have established that a self-employed individual is a ""covered individual"" and ""Secretary"" is the secretary of labor.

The section goes on to state:

    (b) Assistance For Unemployment As A Result Of COVID–19.—Subject to subsection (c), the Secretary *shall* provide to any covered individual unemployment benefit assistance while such individual is unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable to work for the weeks of such unemployment with respect to which the individual is not entitled to any other unemployment compensation (as that term is defined in section 85(b) of title 26, United States Code) or waiting period credit.

So this section is stating that: the Secretary of Labor SHALL (not may) provide to an Covered Individual unemployment benefit assistance while such individual is unemployed.

Now how long do they receive it for?

    (1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in paragraph (2) (Maximum 39 weeks), the assistance authorized under subsection (b) shall be available to a covered individual—

    (A) for weeks of unemployment, partial unemployment, or inability to work caused by COVID–19—

    (i) beginning on or after January 27, 2020; and

    (ii) ending on or before December 31, 2020; and

    (B) subject to subparagraph (A)(ii), as long as the covered individual's unemployment, partial unemployment, or inability to work caused by COVID–19 continues.

So now, how MUCH shall the the Secretary provide to Covered Individuals? 

    (d) Amount Of Assistance.—

    (1) IN GENERAL.—The assistance authorized under subsection (b) for a week of unemployment, partial unemployment, or inability to work shall be—

    (A) (i) the weekly benefit amount authorized under the unemployment compensation law of the State where the covered individual was employed, except that the amount may not be less than the minimum weekly benefit amount described in section 625.6 of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto; and

    (ii) the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 2104 ($600 a week); and

    (B) in the case of an increase of the weekly benefit amount after the date of enactment of this Act, increased in an amount equal to such increase.

Now we get to the fuzzy part. Previously the law is written to say the the Secretary of Labor SHALL provide this assistance to covered individuals. Meaning that it must be done according to federal law. However, now it talks about agreements with states. This is because unemployment funds are not distributed federally, but at the state level. This creates a flaw in the law because although the Secretary is required by law to provide funds to the Covered Individuals, it lacks the infrastructure to do so; so it must make the states do so in order to be compliant with the law. 

    (f) Agreements With States.—

    (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall provide the assistance authorized under subsection (b) through agreements with States which, in the judgment of the Secretary, have an adequate system for administering such assistance through existing State agencies.

Here it states that the secretary shall provide assistance necessary to states through agreements that have an ""adequate system"" in the opinion of the DOL to administer the funds though existing state agencies. What this sounds like to me is that for the Secretary must provide assistance in the terms of funds and infrastructure to states which the Secretary believes already have a good infrastructure to distribute funds. However, for states that lack this infrastructure, it does not relive the Secretary of Labor form the responsibility of distributing funds to Covered Individuals as required by federal law we saw above. Meaning if unable to distribute funds through a state, in order to comply with the law, the Secretary of Labor would need to distribute funds of their own accord and the only way I can see the department doing that is by establishing a federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance office and website to process and distribute the assistance at the federal level. Something like Healthcare.gov for example. 


Now we get into the other section which is a bit redundant and makes things fuzzier.

**SEC. 2104. EMERGENCY INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION BENEFITS.**

    (a) Federal-State Agreements.—Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the “Secretary”). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days’ written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.

So here again we see ""agreements"". What does the agreement consist of?

    (b) Provisions Of Agreement.—

    (1) FEDERAL PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.—Any agreement under this section shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of regular compensation to individuals in amounts and to the extent that they would be determined if the State law of the State were applied, with respect to any week for which the individual is (disregarding this section) otherwise entitled under the State law to receive regular compensation, as if such State law had been modified in a manner such that the amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) payable for any week shall be equal to—

    (A) the amount determined under the State law (before the application of this paragraph), plus

    (B) an additional amount of $600 (in this section referred to as “Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation”).

    (2) ALLOWABLE METHODS OF PAYMENT.—Any Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation provided for in accordance with paragraph (1) shall be payable either—

(A) as an amount which is paid at the same time and in the same manner as any regular compensation otherwise payable for the week involved; or

    (B) at the option of the State, by payments which are made separately from, but on the same weekly basis as, any regular compensation otherwise payable.

So here it states that States which WANT TO make an agreement wit the federal government may do so and provide their normal unemployment benefits, an addition $600 weekly and they will be 100% fully compensated for it with federal funds. 

Yet it states nothing about what happens in regards to states which do NOT enter into the agreement. This section applies to individuals who qualify for regular unemployment already and is an increase of their assistance. 

**THEN** SEC. 2107.  comes around titled PANDEMIC EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.

This section is a word-for-word repeat of Section 2104 except that it applies to individuals who do NOT qualify for regular unemployment according to state law because they are self-employed or have exhausted their regular benefits.

    (2) PROVISIONS OF AGREEMENT.—Any agreement under paragraph (1) shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who—

    (B) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law;

    (C) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada (WTF is Canada here?) ; and

    (D) are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.

Again, it states nothing about what happens in regards to states which do NOT enter into the agreement.

The verdict is that the law is a clusterfuck and they didn't realize that they wrote a loophole into it OR, they purposely wrote a loophole into so Mr. Krabs states could wiggle out of it, and, as always, all the money ends up in the hands of the Northeast and California.

I started to file a claim on the NC website, but its base period for work was before I moved. So it was asking for my work history in 2019 and 2018, not 2020.

I just thought I read  somewhere that you file in the state you last worked in, but  when I  was filling it out it said...

""If  all of your work in the  base period was performed and  reported in a  state other than North  Carolina, you will need to file in  that state.""

Then

""Your base period is from 10/01/2018 to 09/30/2019""

I used to have asthma as a child and I have some heart/lung problems, I don't have many regular asthma symptoms anymore but I still have trouble occasionally and can't do physical activity for longer than about 5-10 minutes before I have to take a break. For my other problems I'm not sure what I have, but at times I can't breathe because I get a sharp pain in my lungs/heart areas for about 7-10 minutes at a time. I'm scared to get sick, and all of my brothers and most other family members aren't in the best shape either. Even if I didn't feel at risk because of my past/current problems, I still don't want to bring the virus home to my loved ones.

A few days ago I let my job know I didn't feel comfortable coming in because of fear of the virus and haven't been back since. I kind of want to work to help out but I'm not working without proof I'm gonna be helped if I get the virus and my McDonald's afaik isn't helping their employees. They also aren't being very understanding emotionally (they weren't before either, but I couldn't do much then, at the moment being abusive is absolutely inexcusable), because not everyone is going to be 100% okay and working capacity right now, we are in the middle of a major historical world event.

A: Individuals are still required to log onto the CONNECT system every 2 weeks to complete their request for benefits.

However, you must fulfill the work search requirements for any weeks prior to March 15, 2020. When completing the request, you will be asked questions regarding looking for work, your ability and availability for work, and any work and earnings for the prior 2 weeks. If you answer in the negative, that you did not search for work, you will not be asked to complete a work search log. You may be asked additional questions regarding searching for work; if you did not search for work due to the waiver in Emergency Order No. DEO 20-11, you may put not applicable or not able to search for work and proceed through to the next step in the request process. You may be asked additional questions that need to be answered to proceed to the next step in the request process. If you did search for work, you may be asked to complete a work search log.

(Univ of Washington, funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation)

If you pull up the IMHE website, you can select predictions for Florida and all of the other states.

Because it is updated every day, last week it showed fewer overall deaths in Florida and we were well within all of our hospital and ICU bed supply, while today all of the numbers are lower than they were yesterday, but higher than they were last week.

(As of today, the model continues to predict that we could have enough hospital beds as a statewide count -- metro needs would likely be different -- but at peak hospital usage, we may need almost 300 more ICU beds. Last week, they had us only needing half of the available ICU beds and a little over a quarter of the bed total, but that has changed. Though again, yesterday the numbers were higher than today and pretty much every day, the predicted peak day changes)

It is certainly worth watching. I personally have looked at it several times since it was published.

This creates the illusion of a downward trend on the Florida Health website and allows the state put out bogus totals for new cases each day that are off sometimes by hundreds. If you look at Florida Health's daily graph it makes it look like cases are starting to decline even though their own new case totals don't add up to the total cases they're reporting. If you add them up it's still hundreds short of the actual total they reported (a difference of 259 as of writing this).

They claim that ""Cases entered after 5:00 PM EST will be added to that day's count at the next morning update."" But if you actually do the math it's a different story. Yesterday (3/30) as an example Florida Health is currently showing 772 new cases but sites like [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) actually add that number up to 1,037 new cases on 3/30 using Florida Health's own numbers.

Also the less looked at Florida Disaster data reports (also part of the state gov) have solid numbers that don't quiet lineup with Florida Health's except when it comes to total cases and total deaths.

[https://floridadisaster.org/covid19/covid-19-data-reports/](https://floridadisaster.org/covid19/covid-19-data-reports/)

Even more suspicious is that Florida Disaster removed non-Florida residents from their new confirmed case totals on 3/27 (these are people in Florida with Coronavirus that any other state would be counting). Florida Disaster stopped counting these to help reduce the number of new cases. Then the next day when cases started to skyrocket they just removed the number and graph altogether.

I'm sure if they get confronted they'll either say A) ""*it was tough to update the daily totals""* ...which no, it's not. Every state just tallies total cases and looks at the difference between the previous day... or B) they're trying to ""*accurately report new cases retroactively""* even that doesn't matter since symptoms show up anywhere from 2-14 days after people contract the virus, people get tested at various time after those symptoms become severe and tests vary from hours to days before returning a result. So using the excuse of retroactively updating totals doesn't really matter when those results already have a range of weeks depending on when people contracted the virus.",florida,Florida Health's website is retroactively updating totals to make daily new cases look like they're declining.

“Something to consider: please avoid grocery shopping on April 1-3 unless you have a critical need. Many WIC/SNAP benefits come to low-income families at the first of the month and there will be a surge as these families redeem them. Many of these families' benefits were depleted more quickly because children are staying home from school and some families are going hungry right now. Also, please respect their needs by not buying items with a WIC shelf tag unless you absolutely need them. They cannot simply substitute these items with others; they would go without.

This will also help to keep some of our city's most vulnerable safer by not adding to the crowds in the stores unnecessarily.”

Being salaried, I haven't had my hours cut, nor have I been laid off or furloughed. I still report to work (from home) 5 days a week, but with a 20% reduced gross paycheck.

I'm not even sure where to begin looking into this - I don't know if I'm even eligible, and if so, how I go about signing up for this assistance.

First of all, we truly hope that you are well in this moment of uncertainty.

Secondly, we are contacting you because you have a current or upcoming Airbnb reservation in Florida, which is currently under an emergency order.

As of March 27, 2020, the State of Florida has ordered commercial lodging establishments, including short-term rentals, to immediately begin to cease operations due to coronavirus (COVID-19) concerns.

The order mandates vacation rental operators to refrain from accepting new guests or making new reservations for stays for a 14-day booking period commencing on Saturday, March 28, 2020. There are some exceptions to the order, including:

•	Long-term rentals (30 days or more)
•	Rental stays where guests are currently staying in a vacation rental or have previously booked a stay with a scheduled check-in date of March 28, 2020.
•	Rentals to persons performing military, emergency, governmental, health or infrastructure response, or travelers engaged in non-vacation commercial activities.
You can read the full order here.

Your host has received a similar email from us as well. Please coordinate with them accordingly. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but appreciate your support in ensuring compliance with these regulations as local governments address COVID-19 public health concerns.

Cancellations will be handled according to your host’s cancellation policy or, if booked on or before March 14, 2020 with a check-in date between March 14, 2020 and May 31, 2020, under Airbnb’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy.

For more on Florida’s COVID-19 guidelines and information, please visit their website. Our thoughts are with you and our community during this time.

Thanks,
The Airbnb Team

I don't mind a 20-40 minute commute. Gives me time to listen to audio books.

Florida I have some family that actually just moved there before this whole scenario took place.

Nevada I have no family but some friends in LA.

From what I see in terms of outdoors life, Nevada is great.

 Let your landlord threaten you all they want, they cannot legally evict you without a writ of possession signed by a judge and served by law enforcement. 

If they try to evict you by force or changing the locks, this is an illegal ""self-help"" eviction under Section 83.59, Florida Statutes. Call the police and record everything with your phone. You can sue your landlord and if you win they will owe you 3 months rent. 

Keep in mind that this should be a last resort because you can still be evicted later for failure to pay and this will affect your rental history. However, it is better to be evicted in two months than be homeless now during a national crisis.

I would also implore that you say  in your speeches that not everyone that wear masks and gloves in public places, like grocery shopping are sick.  Most of us are just trying to protect ourselves from getting the virus.  PLEASE tell the people of WPB that to PROTECT themselves with wearing masks and gloves if they have them.  If you look at China when people when grocery shopping, you would see people wearing protection.  If they didn't wear anything, Police would to immediately return home and not to leave their house without mask and gloves on.  Honestly its just  common sense to protect oneself by wearing mask and gloves.  I understand there is a major shortage on gloves and masks, but if you have them, wear them !!!  I was appalled that President Trump and Surgeon General Jerome Adams were telling the public NOT to wear masks and to stop wearing masks about a month ago.  The public listened and believed every word.  I understand that the Doctors and Nurses need them first, but it would make sense for people to wear the N95 or P100 masks so that the hospitals don't have as many people to treat for the virus.  Makes sense, doesn't it ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Also,  the ones that have masks and gloves and wear them out  in public are getting dirty looks constantly.  While in Walmart I was grocery shopping, had my 1/2 respirator and gloves on.  A man walked by me TWICE in an aisle and coughed near me !  People are being intentionally rude and deliberately trying to spook others.  In Publix yesterday I was waiting to check out, and there was a man 2 people ahead of me who started preaching the bible to the woman directly in front of me.  He didn't have mask  or gloves on.  There were 10 people in line and we were all waiting on this guy to stop preaching.  The cashier told him to pay his bill.  I spoke up politely and said to him, can you please pay your bill so that we can get home to our families please?  He said I had devil eyes and wouldn't care if I had a gas mask on and that he was going to finish preaching.    STOP HOLDING PEOPLE UP AT GROCERY STORES !!  You could be holding up a DOCTOR or NURSE that is trying to get food, go home and rest or go back to work !!  THIS IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL  AND PEOPLE ARE NOT TOLERATING THIS BEHAVIOR !!

He texted all of us yesterday saying he got a small business relief thing and got extra money to pay staff to help out. But he said if we take any money from him, we’re legally not allowed to apply for unemployment. So if we don’t take the money, does he get to keep extra money that’s supposed to be for us?

If we take the money, can we *never* file for unemployment or is there a time period?

I’ve been trying to apply like the rest of you with no luck after almost two weeks and I’m officially maxing out credit cards just to buy food. With the $1,200 stimulus check probably never even getting to any of us until June, I’m desperate but don’t want to accept money from the small business thing if our idiotic governor fixes unemployment issues in the next month.

**What I tried:**

* Logging in and trying to get through the app at all times of the day around the clock (6 AM to 5:30 AM the next day)
* Two different computers, an newer ASUS laptop and a Surface Pro
* 2.4 GHz WiFi and 5.0 GHz WiFI
* Several different WiFi connections - At home, McDonalds, and Taco Bell

I finally completed my application today, Friday, from 4:30 AM to 5:45 AM. It was still really slow, but it was reliable enough to upload all the documents I needed, submit the app, and deal with requests for info.

**What finally worked:**

* Definitely use a 5.0 GHz WiFi connection - this was game-changing. It seemed much more stable. I never was able to finish on a 2.4 GHz and first time I used 5.0 on the Surface Pro it worked
* A fully updated Firefox browser (Internet Explorer is also listed as compatible on their website, but I never tested it. I would stay away from Chrome)
* I used an average, Xfinity home WiFi connection with 20/2 down/up speed. The 4/1 down/up speed I was getting at McDonalds seemed way too slow to get the job done even at early morning hours
* Early morning hours when everyone is sleeping - you'll notice the speed and reliability difference
* If you hit a Runtime Error, copy and paste the URL into a new tab and it will often come back

Get your app in before this Saturday at midnight when the effective week ends. This entire week from Sunday, 3/29 will count if you submit by then.

After trying for the last few nights, and constantly getting booted out of the system with runtime errors after the third step (while trying to reset pin), I finally got in at 2:37am this morning, and stayed in until finishing the process at 4:04am. Yes, it actually took that long, but I was just grateful to make it through.

Incidentally, I was filing as a self-employed person. It appears that they've updated SOME of the site to take this into consideration - whereas, in the past, I don't believe the option to specify ""self-employed"" was available. Still, once I got to the point of providing info about my self employment (which was required), it was obvious that they either hadn't updated that page for self-employed people. For example, the form asked for the business name and address (I used mine, even though I don't actually own a business; I work in entertainment, for many people, at many places). 

At the conclusion of the application submission, you're told to login again in 72 hours to check the status of your application.

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Since the order, in my normally quiet and slow county, all the businesses have been packed with cars and people. Our local law enforcement has been complaining about how bad the traffic is now and how many extra people are walking around town. At my own workplace, I’ve had people lining up out the door an hour before we even open! My workplace is considered an essential business, however, 98% of the things we do is completely and utterly non-essential. The majority of people coming in are here for the most ridiculous, unnecessary reasons. It’s all elderly folk too! It’s like people are rebelling or something because they know there is no way to enforce the order.

My coworkers and customers have told me that they’ve been intentionally going to “essential” businesses for no good reason just because they’re bored at home. One person told me that they went to the store just to walk around the home decor section for over an hour. Another person said that they went to target just to smell all the candles. 

It’s kind of ridiculous that we are letting people do this. It’s a huge risk for people to be congregating, touching surfaces, and spreading germs for non essential goods. In my opinion, if fashion and home decor stores have been forced to close their doors because they don’t offer essential goods, shouldn’t we force stores like Walmart and Target to pack away their fashion and decor sections as well?

I know it seems impossible to ask businesses to stop making a profit off of useless shit but they don’t have to stop selling it. Just take it off the shelves or rope off the areas. If a customer comes in and insists that buying the perfect wall art is an essential need for their household, then they can go over to customer service and request the item. There’s no need for rows and rows of non essential goods to be placed out for people to spread their germs all over and treat as a hang out spot. It’ll force people to go into the store, grab what’s essential, and leave. It will probably drastically decrease the lingering, excessive touching, and useless outside trips. Plus, it’ll make cleaning a lot easier too.

I’ve been looking at the predictions models and, with the way things are going now, Florida is predicted to have our hospitals overwhelmed within a month or two. I think the “Stay at Home (but only if you feel like it) Order” has made crowds worse than before. We need some kind of solution to this madness that will actually be enforced.",florida,We really needed to tighten the rules on what’s considered “essential” during this outbreak

Hello all,

I just want to offer some encouragement as I know many of us are beyond stressed with this whole unemployment thing. Last Monday I was furloughed and after 5+ hours of trying, I was luckily able to submit my application.

HOWEVER, my dad needed his PIN reset/identity verified so that is when my daily calls started. I woke up early every day to start calling, and called all day long. Today, a week later, I finally got through and got to hear the actual hold music. After a bit the recording said I could leave my number and someone would call me back. That was around 8 am this morning. At around 2:30 pm I received a call from a 407 area code number and it was a ""kid"" asking me if I needed my PIN reset. It did not sound official at all, alarm bells were going off, but I was desperate. He offered to attempt the verification with just the last 4 digits of my dad's SSN, he hadn't tried it before but thought it would work, but his page kept freezing and logging him out and after a while I gave in and said ""Let's try to whole SSN"" it kept freezing after that but eventually he got it to work and he told me my dad's name and asked that I verify if he had it spelled correctly, then he asked for his phone, email, and mailing address to match it with what he had on file. He gave me a temporary PIN and told me I had to go online and reset it within 24 hours. I did it immediately and bam it worked! 

He was beyond nice and patient and said it was his first day and that he was working from home. So, please know there is hope! He said they're adding more and more people and that things should be a lot better by Friday.

That was just resetting the PIN part though... tonight I get to stay up late and attempt the actual application part of this nightmare but at LEAST the hundreds of calls a day part is over.",florida,UPDATE: I got a call-back from DEO and got my PIN reset!

135,135,my_data_repository,1586271112,fwlu0v,Nan,"In Florida, it could be a month or longer before many people actually start getting approved. The $1,200 stimulus checks may arrive in late April or early May. We still don't know yet, but I couldn't see it arriving any later than that. That could help many continue to survive before unemployment kicks in a worst-case scenario of perhaps even 2 months down the line from now.

Given that the state is great about giving back pay for SNAP Food Benefits, I fully expect them to send a large back pay check when they're finally approving applications. So, it's worth it in my opinion to brace yourself through to the end.

**So, here's how I did it. Fortunately, a lot of companies are offering the following for bills if your income has been affected by Covid-19:**

* Complete waivers (no balance due in the future)
* Interest-free forbearances
* Loan extensions (placing a payment at the very end of the term, but interest accrues)
* Extensions with no late fees you will have to pay back later (like with Geico)

**Here's a list of my savings:**

* $150 - Spending $5 less a day on food (I still eat take-out every meal so it's easy to track)
* $202 - Car loan extension from Capital One (they've told me I can do this for up to 3 months)
* $182 - Navient student loan forbearance
* $40 - Adobe - I have two subscriptions and they offered complete waivers for both for 3 months
* $7 - Microsoft - They gave me a promo code for 3 free months 

**I chose to cancel the following outright:**

* $15 - Audible - I have a lot of credits racked up anyways
* $25 - Car Wash membership
* $15 - Amazon Prime - I'm using someone else's account that lives with me

**My personal choice to keep paying:**

* AT&amp;T - No waivers or discounts. I'll have to pay everything back later
* Geico - Same scenario, but they offer payment plans after you're ready to start paying again",florida,How I'm Saving $630 a Month While I Wait for Unemployment to Kick In

-it was like a small mall or store and i think also a gastation
-it was on the left side of the freeway if you were driving from orlando to miami
-there was a sign that read: north south, but it the arrow was pointing north, so the sign was pointless as it was not pointing south only north

Here's my problem though. When I got laid off and did my application that night, I put my previous 2 jobs from the last 18 months and reported the gross income. However...I completely forgot to list my money from YouTube (AdSense) that I got recently before everything went to shit.

I monetized my YouTube channel in January and have gotten 2 checks from them so far, once per month, for a couple hundred each. I would not consider it a job, since I'm actually not making content right now, and it slipped my mind to try to put this as income on my application. I don't have any tax forms or anything for this money. I'm guessing this would count as 1099 self employed income if I were to file it.

The thing is, I can't find anywhere in the UI website to add this to my application, and obviously the phone lines are inaccessible. I don't know what to do. I'm REALLY worried that this is going to bite me in the ass extremely hard later on when I have to file my taxes next year.

Should I be worried? My revenue is actually going down by a lot right now due to the fact that my highest viewed videos aren't getting many views anymore after last month, so my future income is going to be significantly less than it was when I got those checks.

322,322,ExCap2,1586597498,fz169y,☣️ CORONAVIRUS/COVID-19 ☣️,"Welcome to Florida Unemployment 101. My objective is to give you concise and educational information so you are well informed on how Unemployment works in Florida State. I am NOT an employee for the Florida Department Of Economic Opportunity. So first things first. Hey ExCap 2, how does the entire process work in a nutshell? I'm glad you asked, here we go.

1. You file a new claim on https://connect.myflorida.com/ If there are issues with your application, there will be a notice on your home page, email, or a letter will be sent.
2. Wage Determination is made and a letter is sent out if you qualify based on wages. The letter contains the weekly benefit amount, the balance and the wage history that was used. If you're ineligible a letter is sent with the reason why. You have 20 days from the distribution date of this letter to appeal it/ask for a monetary reconsideration if you think it's missing wages.
3. A Notice of Reemployment Assistance Claim (UCB-412) will be sent to your employer and they have 20 days to respond. If they don't respond; you're automatically awarded Unemployment. However they can appeal this decision. Also there may be a fact finding questionnaire that's sent asking for reason of seperation, return to work, severance pay, etc.
4. You should be claiming your weeks during this entire period that is going on.
5. You're approved! Your employer didn't answer within 20 days or they answered and confirmed that you were laid off for the reason you specific on your application. Keep claiming your weeks every 2 weeks. You're good to go.
6. You're disqualified! Oh no! The employer is appealing the determination. No need to panic. What happens now is you get to go through an appeal hearing!
7. Appeal hearings consist of a Judge, yourself and the employer. Before the hearing both sides have time to submit documentation supporting their sides. After that time you're both sent a letter.
8. The letter has a place to go with a time/date or it's done over the phone with a time/date. Don't be late, call the number when it tells you to. Pretend it's like a court. Show respect, your honor/yes sir/yes maam and don't interrupt the judge/employer when they're talking.
9. Congratulations! You've both explained your sides and now the judge makes a decision within a few days. I believe the decision is reflected on your CONNECT account and they also mail you a letter. If I'm not mistaken, the decision in the hearing is final and can't be appealed.

Did you read all that? Whew. This is just a general write up of how the Unemployment process works. There may be some stuff I left out and may need to touch up. Outside of this COVID-19 crisis, it could take 3-4 weeks to even find out everything. With this COVID-19 going on... it could potentially be double that but it seems the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity is doing what they can to shorten that time.

Alright so there's a few major issues that are affecting a lot of people right now and I'll go through each one and give information on what you can do about it.
1. PIN# Resets - This seems to be a good chunk of the issues I've seen people having. So, on the website you'll see there's a way to reset your PIN# manually. You enter your Social Security # and then hit ""Forgot PIN"" to reset it. This isn't working for everyone so they're telling you to call. Here are the numbers for a PIN# reset that we know of so far:
1-800-204-2418 - Main phone line - Good luck getting through.
1-800-297-0586 - Hang up and try again if it doesn't go through.
1-407-965-2547 - Leave your number and get a call back.
1-866-352-2345 - Option #7

Hopefully this will work out for you. I'll add more numbers as I see them on Facebook/Twitter and they're confirmed by multiple people.
2. Identity Verification - This seems to be he second biggest issue. So there is a number strictly for this which is: 1-888-993-9713 - I was never able to get through on this in all my attempts but some have on Facebook/Twitter. Now on to the other methods, Fax and E-mail. You have to send a copy of your SIGNED Social Security Card, Valid Driver's License/State ID and there has been letters sent asking for Birth Certificate (send this if you have it).
Fax: 321-332-6608
Email: identityrequest@deo.myflorida.com

3. @#%@#% website is a piece of @#%@#% - Alright. So the best advice I can give here is to use Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer and to go on the website between 11pm-5am for the best experience when you're claiming weeks/filing a new claim/checking your account.
There's a new website that's taking applications. This website doesn't seem like it's connected to the main one and they're doing it just so they can copy/paste information over to the main website to get you in and it probably establishes your claim date. Definitely put your application in if you're having PIN# issues and can't get through on the phone numbers over a few days.
As to whether or not you should still try on the main website as well; that's up to you. I would if you do it at night it may be a little easier. I'm sure if they see your informaton on new website and old; they'll cross check everything.
4. Oh yeah this issue. The work search requirement and how to answer your questions. Here's an example: 
http://floridajobs.org/docs/default-source/reemployment-assistance-center/ra-covid-19-faqs-eng.pdf?sfvrsn=805543b0_14
1 .See page 3 of the above FAQ on how to answer 'Did you look for work?'
2. Did you look for work? YES (You can say NO if you read FAQ how to fill it out)
3. Did you make an in-person contact at a CareerSource Center? NO
4. Were you able and available to work if work had been offered? YES (Never say no to this)
5. Did you refuse any offer of work or referral for work? NO
6. Did you work or earn any money? NO
7. Did you receive or apply for income from any other sources that you have not previously reported to us? NO
Obviously answer these with what is going on in your own individual situation but generally most people choose the above I would think.
I believe that's everything I can think of right now. I'm going to have to wait until the website comes back up to show you some things to check out for on the main website in the different menus so you know what's going on.

351,351,aeneva,1586633527,fzfvat,Nan,"[The unemployment website was a $77 million project implemented by Deloitte](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/03/31/ron-desantis-was-warned-about-floridas-broken-unemployment-website-last-year-audit-shows/). As someone who works in the software industry, I believe the website is failing to scale (i.e., failing to meet the demands of large amounts of traffic) because of poor engineering. 

I don't expect government officials to be experts on technology, just like I wouldn't expect a software engineer to understand how to write a bill and present it to the state legislature. I would pin a lot of these issues on Deloitte, as much as I would any company hired to fulfill a contract. 

But here's the difference when it comes to software. If a firm is hired to design and build a bridge, and decides to use subpar techniques and materials to cut costs, they are held liable if the bridge fails. Unfortunately, software engineering is not so tightly regulated, so companies feel free to cut corners and do the bare minimum when it comes to development. This results in software failures like the Boeing 737 MAX, the Equifax data breach, and now this. Contractors essentially have no incentive to go past fulfilling the bare minimum specifications, and I think that's what Deloitte did.

(As a sidenote: where does the money go when companies do this? Most likely, it gets sucked up along the management hierarchy.)

I'm seeing a lot of discussion about whether the state government intentionally wanted to make this software work poorly, so I'd like to touch on that. While so-called ""hostile UX"" and [""dark patterns""](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22115951) do exist in software engineering, I do *not* think that the website was intentionally implemented in a way that would prevent it from handling a large volume of users. When it comes to government contracts, all the specifications are documented extensively due to the negotiations that have to occur when planning out the scope of the project. I doubt Deloitte would accept the liability of intentionally implementing specifications designed to make accessing government services difficult. 

To be clear, the application being complicated (e.g., too many questions, documents, and steps required) versus the application being inaccessible (e.g., the system going down, showing error messages, needing to submit forms multiple times) are two entirely different issues, and I do not believe the latter was intentional. As for the former, to me it seems like the typical bureaucratic process that you'd encounter in any government agency, and for that, we can definitely blame the state.

What about the other bugs that the audit caught? Were they intentional and, if not, why weren't they fixed? Again, I don't think Deloitte would intentionally put bugs into their software because that would've been documented in the specifications and they wouldn't accept that liability. The bugs are simply a result of poor engineering. So, why weren't the bugs fixed? For a lot of software, development teams are totally aware of the problems that their systems have, but they simply don't have the resources to re-engineer them. So, when a user runs into a bug, they may choose to handle the user's request manually, i.e., wait for someone to call support and then process their request manually. This can work fine for a really long time when your software is low traffic.

But when you have a huge influx of traffic, it all falls apart. That's probably what happened with the unemployment website. The state government was aware of the bugs, but whoever was maintaining it didn't have the resources to fix them, so they opted to handle them manually for the time being instead of trying to explain why a $77 million project **still** needed more money thrown at it. It was the path of least resistance and it ended up being a bad call. But to be fair, who could've predicted that 10-30% of the workforce would be needing unemployment benefits in such a short period of time?

As for why these bugs weren't caught before the project was handed off to the state, I'm sure Deloitte demonstrated the software met the specifications outlined by the state. However, users interact with software in ways we don't expect. Software also may malfunction when it doesn't have enough hardware resources to perform the tasks it needs to do. So, Deloitte doing a demo for the state government might go swimmingly, since it's one person interacting with the system in a scripted way, but when you have 20,000 people trying to submit their documentation at once, and maybe some of the scans are huge... things could break really quickly when the system isn't built with quality and best practices in mind.

If you are furious about what's happening, demand better [regulation for software development and engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_professionalism), especially when it comes to who the government can hire. That's the root of the issue and that's the only thing that will keep this from happening again. Most states don't regulate it as a profession in any way. Texas appears to be the only state that does and, technically, [Florida does limit who can call themselves a software engineer](https://fbpe.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Chapter-471-as-of-07-01-19.pdf). However, I've never seen this enforced in Florida.

And by the way, most companies **do not** want regulation for software development. They like being able to hire the cheapest developers and holding zero liability for the unmaintainable, barely modifiable, buggy code they write. And many developers like this, too. The change must come from the people who are sick of online services that don't work, having their data compromised again and again, and being subject to unsafe technology in our critical infrastructure.

I don't think there's any established movement for this, or any petition you can sign, so for now, I'd say try to raise awareness with your family, friends, and local legislators. Maybe we can get something started in Florida since we've been so profoundly affected by it.",florida,"The unemployment website is not a failure of government, but of software engineering."

Knowing that, can I eligible for PUA? If so, how can I file for PUA? Would filing for PUA have an impact on my state unemployment claim? Should I request benefit payment on Connect as requested on 4/14?

Thanks a lot for your help!

Overall, Florida is looking much better off than a week ago. New cases and new hospitalizations per day have slowed down or is decreasing. Deaths per day is also decreasing.  It's interesting that we are seeing this now with the decrease of confirmed cases and not in a few days or so. But we've had some decent reports that this might be due to the lag in testing. Total active infections is still growing albeit slowly right now.

**The Moderation / Mod Action Process**

1.	The first step for minor rule infractions will result in a warning and a removal of the offending post and *may* include a 24-36 hour temp ban. This is entirely up to the mod team who will decide on a case by case basis. [Petty slapfighting]( https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slapfight) may result in an automatic 36 hour ban for both parties.

2.	If you've previously been warned about anything, the next offense will result in a temp ban that can be from 3 to 10 days. The previous warnings do not have to be related to the current offense - we assume that if you are warned about something, you will be smart enough to read the rules and avoid breaking them again. And yes, we do keep a record of warnings.

3.	If you break a rule after a second time-out/warning or you violate any rule in a way that a mod deems an egregious violation, you're gone to permaban town.

4.	If at any point you respond to a mod action with a shitty modmail or DM, you automatically get upgraded to a permaban. If you respond to a warning with a nasty comment, that's also a permaban. If you threaten, insult, whine, or otherwise act like an asshole in any way in response to a mod action, you will be muted and permabanned. This includes “but…. but the other poster called me a ______ and you didn’t punish them!” Mod actions against other users are not up for discussion. If you feel another user has said something out of line, **please use the report button.** Do not feed the trolls!

5.	If you believe that the mod action against you is not fair or undeserved or you want it reversed, there is an appeal process. The appeal process is to send us a modmail (or respond to the ban message) politely requesting an appeal and clearly and concisely laying out the case for why you believe the mod action was in error. This will be looked over by a majority of the mods, and we'll vote on whether to revoke the action or not. We will try to respond to all appeals within 48 hours, but keep in mind that this is not our job - we are volunteers who have careers, families, and lives outside of Reddit. Also, see #4 - if your appeal message calls the mods stupid or is nothing but insults or petulant whining, you may as well not appeal at all.

6.	Ultimately, modding is a very subjective thing. We reserve our right to use discretion where we see fit. We try to be as objective as possible and evaluate everything through the lens of Reddit's and /r/Florida’s rules, but sometimes a mod action is a judgement call. You might disagree, and that's fine, but at the end of the day, in a subjective disagreement, we generally err on the side of the mods.

We want to encourage a productive, fun, and welcoming place for discussing issues important to Florida, and we don't want to stifle political speech. We’re asking the users to be reasonable and have discussions in good faith. We'd love everyone's cooperation and understanding and if you feel that some of the rules are unfair or need expanding or we need more/less rules, by all means provide feedback - we do actually listen to y’all and take suggestions into account.",florida,Rule Updates / Clarifications - New Mod Policies - Feedback Wanted

&amp;#x200B;

maybe there is a way to get new plates and registration by mail? (I think some states do that ...)

&amp;#x200B;

or maybe even online? who knows it's 2020

&amp;#x200B;

maybe there is a way to get temporary plates? or some some way ...

&amp;#x200B;

details:

I see that FLHSMV \*advise\* (not mandatory) for both seller and buyer to go to MVSC (ref 1)

and

buyer must visit MVSC to get plates and registration (ref 2)

&amp;#x200B;

but all MVSC are closed due to COVID-19

&amp;#x200B;

or essentially could just get the title from the seller and insure it just in case - and let the vehicle stand there without plates (till MVSC re-open) - but it's not a private driveway - it's in a gated senior community (so not sure if that is legal)...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and even once MVSC re-open - they will likely be flooded with people - with people in the same boat ... and the two transacting parties are a 69 (my mom) and 74 year old women (her acquaintance who was all ready to go retire in Europe for good and will be gone as soon as this stabilizes) :/ wouldn't want them to catch COVID-19 at their age at the MVSC

&amp;#x200B;

Hmmm I am in NYC - maybe I could help - maybe I could get the title by mail and make a temporary registration in NY in my name, and send the plates by mail to my mom ... and then what ?  ohhh God sounds too complicated ...

I'm also not stupid enough to fail to realize that I could have easily been unemployed too. I didn't make a conscious decision to choose a pandemic proof industry, this was blind luck on my part.

Lets be clear about something first off, unemployment is not a government handout, it is a safety net we pay for every single year. 6% of the first 7000 dollars our employers pay us is taxed to fund the system, we're essentially enrolled whether we want to be or not in a form of insurance. If you've been working for decades it's entirely possible you've paid thousands if not tens of thousand of dollars in ""premium"". Unemployment not paying out is not like food stamp money running out, it is more like you dying and your life insurance company not wanting to pay. It is a violation of trust and fiduciary responsibility.

With this in mind, It is now clear that the entire unemployment system in Florida was designed to frustrate and inconvenience applicants. This was done with direct antipathy towards the type of people (or the supposed types of people) who make use of unemployment. This was a system designed to fail, designed to be slow and designed to be confusing. Flexibility was not included, because the need for flexibility in a mass unemployment situation was not thought of as possibly ever needed or perhaps not even considered desirable.

Now, due to malice towards a astonishingly small part of the population that may abuse unemployment, we're faced with a situation where a huge chunk of Floridian workers are being harmed. Disney world workers are about to start applying for unemployment soon. I've seldom met people who work harder than disney world staff. Often, they are even taking the admittedly lower wages people get from themeparks just so they have the chance to work for a place that makes them happy. These are not freeloaders. I'm sure the vast majority would be back working at the parks if they could. The idea that these people are going to be punished because our governor and his predecessor hates what I'm sure they view as ""social leeches"" is infuriating.

This corona virus just made it so that most people cant work so they can stay safe. There wasnt so great fire that destroyed all the houses and lumber, or some plague that destroyed all the crops and killed all the animals. Physically, there is no shortage of food or land or housing. Yet shitloads of people are going to go hungry and lose their houses by the looks of it, Houses that are already built and done. Even though physically, there is no shortage of food or land. It makes no sense to me.

Our problem is not that there isnt enough housing or food for everyone, but that we wont have the money to afford them. If you think about it, its absurdly stupid. 

Im not even trying to be overtly political this just seems like a really ridiculous situation and im angry and frustrated about it.

 I had some emergencies a few months  that depleted my savings and strained my credit. This my last college semester and i was only taking two classes so i just started  working around 25 hours a week  at a decent tutoring place that paid good money, hrlping me pay bills and rebuild credit.

Keeping more of your weekly paycheck means less available for unemployment and other public programs. The high tax states have more resources available for such programs so they can give more. However, they also take more from each paycheck, including social security and other retirement income, so many earners move to Florida to escape those taxes.  This has helped keep Florida job market growing and I am pretty confident it will continue to do so. So although unemployment benefits are low, the likelihood of staying on unemployment for an extended period of time is low in comparison to other states as well, since the job market is always growing. In the current emergency situation, we have the federal unemployment assistance program which helps everyone for a limited time.  I am just trying to put this conversation into a greater perspective and I am not for or against either side.  Now, the fact the system is down for so long is inexcusable and someone should be held accountable. Those are my two cents.",florida,Something to keep in mind when comparing unemployment benefits.

 After battling with the state's JOKE of a website, after waking up at odd hours of the night to access the system, after practicing adequate social distancing with my computer by throwing it against the wall every time I get booted off, I FINALLY filed for unemployment.  My application was (presumably) received, and I have submitted the claims for unemployment benefits for the specific weeks listed on my dashboard.  I'm grateful to have reached this point as I know many Floridians haven't even gotten this far yet.  

But now what?  This ship is clearly sinking fast. Can someone throw a life raft of information or encouragement?   Has anyone in Florida actually begun to *receive* unemployment compensation?

My father was already down on his luck trying to pay the insanely high Orlando rent for his apartment by working 6 days a week as an independent contractor with no benefits of any kind, sick leave, or vacation, or any other worker protections. Yet at least as a contractor he could pay his bills because Florida's shit, eternally stagnant minimum wage wouldn't cover half of his expenses. 

Then the virus comes around, the parks shut down and so does his company as they rely on the tourism/parks. We're worried because we don't know what to do, then the CARES act passes and we feel a wave of relief because independent contractors are covered under the law. Federal funds would pay for those worker's unemployment while this blows over, no big deal. 

Except Florida has to fuck it all up as usual. Website is shit, takes days to apply, now its been a month still under review. You can't talk to a live person, we don't even know is the $600 for independent contractors will EVER be implemented.  So I'm paying the bills, out of kindness I pay April's rent from my own money hoping for the stimulus checks and unemployment. Yet every day things get more stressful as no sign of unemployment working. The EIDL loans being offered with a $10,000 advance turn into a $1,000 advance. That hasn't come through either. 

Then the condo association/HOA where my parents live start fucking with them because they suddenly on't like that my father's car has some uneven paint and try to get it towed. I spend an entire 8 hours calling and emailing back and forth about what we can do to prevent the car being towed because a group of senile, good-old-boys who haven't worked for a living in decades think the car is ugly.

Now the landlord communicated that he expects his rent on May 1st regardless of what's going on because of the ""stimulus checks"", which my father has not received. Add on a bit of marital issues, the fear that if he were to get sick he'd probably die as he's 64 years old and has risk factors, and noticing that I'm trying to hold it together providing for 2 families with my single income, and I imagine it took him over the edge. My mother found him halfway over the balcony's railing until she stopped him. He had mentioned to me that he felt ""tired of life"", ""useless"", a ""failure"" etc, all because 2008's crisis took everything away from him and he's probably close to reliving history. And yet the taxes people pay are nowhere to be seen because the state can't figure out how to protect its citizen's in time of crisis.

The Medical Staff of AdventHealth Waterman Hospital in Tavares, FL, is requesting donations from the community for 3D printed personal protective equipment (PPE). Though our hospital is doing an outstanding job of keeping us stocked with PPE currently, and the AdventHealth Hospital system has been tracking down every conceivable supply network, we all realize that the supply chain for other major networks in New York and Washington State could not keep up with the surge of Covid-19 patients, and eventually ran out of PPE. We are trying to plan ahead to make sure our staff remains safe and protected, even in worst case scenarios.

However, as 3D generation of PPE can be quite time-consuming, the time to prepare is now. If our hospital supply of PPE does not get exhausted, we will not need to put our 3D generated “Montana” masks to use here, but it will not go to waste! We will forward it on to other areas of the country where the pandemic has indeed exhausted the normal supply chain. We are, however, actively using Face Shields at this time.

We wish to thank all volunteers who have helped us thus far, and we appreciated any donations of PPE you can offer.

As far as I know there is no information regarding back pay for those who have been waiting for over a month just to be approved and somehow the Governor has never been asked this question. This and the new executive order need some clarification. Will we ever see the money we are owed that we never recieved due to the failure Florida's outdated unemployment website? Will our weeks be automatically claimed going forward? How will we know our current Unemployment status if we cannot access the website?
