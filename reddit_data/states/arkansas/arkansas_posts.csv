Tonight, ends a decade. A decade of amazing memories for myself and hopefully the rest of you. This decade also brought sad and horrible things such as shootings, bombings, war, and more war. I feel and pray that the 2020's will be much better and bring peace to all people on Earth. Cheers to a great decade and even more cheers to a greater one! Happy New Year!

We currently live in New Hampshire. My job is expanding to Conway and I'm being sent with it. I'm a software engineer and will still be making about 115k a year. My research tells me Greenbrier is a safe middle class area but I thought I'd get some opinions on the Conway area in general. I have a bunch of little boys and we are outdoorsy and like to go camping and hunting. My wife goes long distance running so the place we live has to be safe as she goes a lone.

I am \*assuming\* the data is current.

To change the map so it shows the Arkansas state senate districts:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

2. Look under the ""Overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.

163,Iridemhard,1579808885,esyaj3,Nan,"Sorry its so long (thats what he said), but this is important. Please read all. 

Donald trump is now wanting to look at cutting social security and medicaid at the end of the year. With the help of other republicans in congress, senate, and house its only a matter of time before they raise the retirement age to 67. Here is a fact for you. The life expectancy of an Arkansan is 74.5 years for men and 80 for women. That means you will work pretty much your entire life and enjoy retirement for maybe 10 years IF youre lucky.

Last i heard trump wants to make changes to the food stamp program. Arkansas is a red state but c'mon people. Youre basically cutting the throats of your fellow arkansans voting red again. Im sure there are many thay abuse these programs, but there are many who need the help when they fall on hard times. And guess what, hard times are coming. Historically, we enter a recession every 7 years. We havent had one since 08 which means we are way overdue. 

The 20% tax rate has its benefits and it doesnt. The benefits are for the executives at the top as well as shareholders. I can tell you a downside from my experience. I worked for a manufacturing company in NWA. Due to tax cuts the company received, they were able to purchase modern equiptment that included robotic equiptment. As a result there wasnt a need for as many people so many were laid off and there is no way theyre bringing those people back. Temps are their thing now. Those temps are paid less and dont receive the benefits. Those temps are kept for years with no chance of being hired on.  The middle class employees most likely found another job but now have to start over on vacation, most likely got lower pay, they also have less senority which has increased their chance of being laid off yet again during the next economic downturn. And like i said before, its coming and many economic experts agree. 

There are average household income level is between 45-55 thousand arkansas which means many of us are closer to the poverty level than we are on the rich side. Voting red is like cutting your own throats. Its time we stop buying into this spin the red likes to throw at us. Every once in a while, we need to vote to help OURSELVES. This corporate welfare horeshit is only hurting us so vote blue this next election.",Arkansas,Trump cuts

2. How to find cheap housing? When I first moved to my current city the cheapest I could find was $550. I now rent at $175. I’m not looking for $175 but I know cheap housing is out there if you know the right people. 

3. Are you guys friendly? My friend who recently moved to the Midwest said we’re some of the nicest people. Like, others don’t have a casual conversation with every person you encounter. And it takes you thirty minutes to leave someone’s house because you always get distracted with another story. If I move and everyone is mean to me I don’t think I could handle it. I will cry.

Just about every last one of them is a corrupt SOB, two groups of mafia gangsters all in the same smokey private backroom engaged in the same crimes but debating about how they should divvy up the stolen loot. 

Complete parasites of society, the lot of'em. They offer nothing, produce nothing, create nothing. In fact, they are the enemy of creativity and free thought. They protect the status quo, combatting any change (as they see change as a threat to their position of power and income) at the great expense of the many.

I'd rather our government be filled with used car salesman than these crooked politicians. A darn broke heroin addict is more honorable. The only two parts a politician got is a mouth and an asshole. 

I hates politicians.

225,Awesomesause1988,1580539916,ex2a25,Politics ,"Washington Post columnist and *bipartisan* Senate-insider Dana Milbank, referencing opinions of GOP as well as Democrat Senators, says that Cotton “has surpassed Ted Cruz as the most disliked member of the Senate.” 

“Colleagues and staff on the Hill report that he can be as nasty privately as he is publicly, as uncivil to Republicans as he is to Democrats,” Milbank writes. “He imputes ill motives to those who disagree with him. He served in the military but now treats politics as war.” 


Cotton is a tedious, hyper-partisan, deeply cynical political operator who loves to put on a demagogic show. There is cruelty in Cotton, but the trouble isn’t that he’s mean to his colleagues. We ought to worry more about the people whose names never make the newspaper, but who suffer at the hands of this rigid ideologue who has devoted his career to throwing cancer-patient marijuana users into prisons and cheerleading for ever more war and military aggression abroad.


Dumbfoundingly, Cotton, *unlike most American veterans*, believes not only that the Iraq War was not a mistake, but that it “was a just and noble war” we should be proud of. 


Cotton on Wednesday offered legislative language that would ""automatically"" punish *family members* of people who violate U.S. sanctions against Iran, levying sentences of up to 20 years in prison. 

[He LITERALLY wants to harm children and spouses of people who are accused of engaging in economic activity that he doesn't approve of with Iran.]

Little Rock and Dillard's were close to an [agreement](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2014/01/25/little-rocks-river-trail-inches-toward-the-dillards-gap) in 2014 to route the trail behind the headquarters, but when the costs to complete the trail required a public bidding process Dillard's halted the process because CDI would not get a no-bid contract for that section of trail. CDI is wholely owned by Dillard's. In 2008 [John Glassgow](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2015/03/12/remains-found-on-petit-jean-are-those-of-john-glasgow) of CDI went missing and his remains were found on Petit Jean in 2015. At that time, it was suspected that Dillard's was overpaying the construction of its stores nationwide in a scheme to extract money from the publicly traded retailer. Dillard's [acquired](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080829005686/en/Dillards-Announces-Completion-Acquisition-CDI-Contractors-LLC) CDI in 2008.  
  
Compared to NW Arkansas Trails, which brought $137mm in economic benefits, Little Rock has a lot of potentials. The diversion of bicycle traffic around the Dillard's Gap is a big detriment to bringing the 2- wheeled tourists to our wonderful piece of the world. Closing the Dillard's Gap is not just for the tourists. If there were a dedicated protected bicycle path from west Little Rock to Downtown many people would utilize it for commuting to work, helping to alleviate traffic around the notorious Cantrell and I-430 area.  
  
BikePed Little Rock has ongoing projects to continue to connect the bike path, last in 2017 with the [ART - Medical Mile](https://www.littlerock.gov/for-residents/bikeped-little-rock/projects/projects-timeline/art-medical-mile-ramp/) which brings the trail the railroad bridge just east of Dillard's Headquarters. Since then, not much activity has happened with a changing city administration and corporate stonewalling of a clearly public benefit bicycle trail.  
  
Dillard's is not even in the [top 10 employers](https://www.littlerockchamber.com/economic-development/locate-or-expand/major-employers/) in Little Rock and when the city offered to use eminent domain to secure the trail's path, Dillard's threatened with moving their Headquarters to Texas.",Arkansas,Arkansas River Trail and the Dillard's Gap

I realize this has little to do with the state of Arkansas itself. But I’m posting here because it’s a fun, harmless video intended to display an odd feat with no particular purpose and willingness to follow through on a project that makes many scratch their heads. I think we can all appreciate and poke fun at that.

Fun fact: Did you know this Capitol building is slightly tilted? The foundation was laid about 9 degrees off square. I find this super interesting because this was also the only building that I struggled to capture a symmetrical photo of from its front due to both the winding path that leads to a set of flagpoles that also aren’t centered with the front door.

&gt;
&gt; Thank you for contacting me about the impeachment trial of President Trump. It is good to hear from you, as always.
&gt;
&gt; On July 25, 2019, President Trump spoke over the phone with Ukraine’s newly-elected President, Volodymyr Zelensky. After the call, someone within the intelligence community who was not on the call filed a whistleblower complaint against the president. According to reports, the whistleblower coordinated with the staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman, Adam Schiff, staff before filing the complaint. After the whistleblower complaint was filed, Democratic Party leaders in the House of Representatives used it to justify opening an impeachment inquiry.
&gt;
&gt; Despite an unprecedented act of transparency by President Trump in releasing the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian leader, the Democratic Party nevertheless plunged headlong into a rushed and partisan impeachment process, the conclusion of which seemed predetermined from the start. They ignored precedent, gave no due process rights to President Trump to defend himself against the accusations, and refused to provide Republicans in Congress with the authority to call their own witnesses. The Democratic Party claimed it was necessary to rush the impeachment because it was an “urgent” matter, yet then they chose not to even send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate for trial for four long weeks.
&gt;
&gt; The House Democrats then sought to plunge the Senate into a months-long fishing expedition by asking it to finish the House’s work for it and subpoena witnesses that the House never bothered to pursue. It is clear that that the impeachment effort against President Trump has been nothing more than a political exercise by the Democrats in the House, with no regard for truth and with the obvious purpose of leaving a cloud hanging over President Trump while distracting from our work on behalf of the American people. It is a shame that the Democratic Party chose not to dedicate even a fraction of this legislative energy to improving the lives of hardworking Americans instead.
&gt;
&gt; I’m honored to serve as your senator. You, your family, and our state will remain on my mind and close to my heart in my work. Always feel free to call my office at (202) 224-2353 or visit www.cotton.senate.gov. Be sure to drop by my office and say hello if you ever visit our nation’s capital.

We are finalizing some documents and looking to close on selling our home and moving to AR in early March. We have decided on the Heber Springs area and have a home under contract there. The area seems very nice, it is fairly green even in the winter and it is seemingy very quiet. I understand it has a tourism element that leads to summer time vacations and weekends providing more people visiting, but that doesn’t seem so bad. 

I have had an AWFUL time pinning down utilities and internet. One of the power providers didn’t understand how to answer a phone and then wasn’t sure if they provided power to the address. We weren’t able to get in touch about water at all. Suddenlink said they service the address, but then called me back to tell me that they don’t and that online it ONLY sees the zip code when selecting plans. (Fix your shit!)  Windstream sounded very confused, but said they offered internet, but had no idea if speeds would ever get better. No one else could help me, even though TCW says they are capable pf servicing 100% of the area. O.o  I need internet for work so I have been struggling to find any other source that is more reliable or faster, but have come up empty. Any suggestions?

What are the growing seasons like?  Coming from the cramped city and 1/4-acre-or-less life we can’t gave much of a garden. Between space and the fact that houses are literally so close that they shade your yard it gets depressing. I would really like to do some gardening. I help my parents every year, but will be moving a few hundred miles away and wanted to grow my own stuff. 

How does car registration work?  It doesn’t appear that emissions is a thing, but is there a requirement for extra stuff?  Do you have to show proof of insurance, provide a valid license or proof of residence?  I ask because I haven’t regularly driven my car for about 2 years because it doesn’t pass emissions and working from home has allowed me to avoid the costly repair that shuts up my OBD2. Car runs and drives fine, but that little scan tool flags for automatic fail and it would be great to have my car back again. 

Can someone help me understand the income tax?  It appears as if you get taxed different percentages based on earning. So this much is taxes here and it keeps going up until you hit the ceiling. Is this something that the payroll group will do or do I have to file a special form?  TN has no income tax and all of my working years  have been spent here.

man i remember when kids spat on me multiple times when i was in school. glad the school acted appropriately for her but my school district didnt do a thing. security guards didnt do a thing. if anything they slapped my face to when i fought once in self defense. when 4 kids assaulted me with literally sticks and stones in front of my mother, the school tried to arrest my mother for intervening and pulling those kids away. those kids didnt get any repercussion. kids would loudly call me chink in classes and teachers would just tell them to shush. 
honestly i dont remember those kids faces but i sure can remember those teachers faces. 
for some fucked up reason i had to be extra vigilant to make my cases even when i reported my situation to any person of color in school offices. i had zero sympathy. 
yes racism against black and brown people are there. i dont doubt that. but i hope people understand that asians go through it too... yet often ignored because they expect the quiet “model immigrant citizens” to just take it. shit gets pretty blatant and pervasive on media but that never warrants as much rage as other racism.",Arkansas,racism is racism

Trying as many local breweries as I can is a bit of a hobby of mine, whether I’m home in AR or visiting somewhere else, so I’m eager to see and hear about all of the breweries we have in our state.

I counted 32 breweries currently operating in AR with two more set to open in Central AR this spring to bring the number to 34. (There may be more opening up in other parts of the state but I’m just unaware. Part of the reason I wanted to start this subreddit!).

Hello Reddit i don't normally ever post here and if i do its for stupid shit but i would just like either you opinion or your support

I go to Bentonville schools and one of my really good friends has a severe case of Auto Immunity Deficiency disorder so basically if she gets the virus she will most likely die from it and i know some teachers that also have the disorder who are in serious risk also children do not show symptoms of this virus so they can easily spread it without knowing it now if they closed schools my friend wouldn't have to worry because she would be at home doing work on her computer but since our schools decided to not even consider closing for safety reasons she now has to go to our schools with the threat that we may very well be already infected with it

is it just me or does the governor of this state care more about money and revenue than the safety of the students that live here?",Arkansas,Governor Refusing To Close Schools

The CDC has warned against large group gathering and its obvious Huchinson doesnt hear the message. Ive fucking had it with these medical costs of regular sickness and now we have to worry about long hospital stays which will mostly certainly be a huge hit for us financially.

Whether these individuals are the most vulnerable to the virus or not, THAT IS BESIDES MY POINT. About 810,000 are aged 5-24, mostly K-12 or college students. If you're telling me that at least ONE student hasn't been exposed to the virus yet and spread it to others, you're wrong. If we close ALL of the schools and pile the 30% with the 40% of the population which are vulnerable, it's going to be MASS MAYHEM. We don't have enough doctors, enough hospitals to treat these potential cases. You don't have to believe me, I'm not going to force you to, but if such event were to happen, don't say I didn't warn you. We were warned by individuals from foreign countries for a while now that this virus would come and that we should socially distance ourselves as soon as possible.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like this is all part of life 

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

This poll will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

My assumption is that these restaurants need to stay open to help deliver food supply to citizens - if they were all shut down, it would put enormous pressure on point of sale places like WalMart, Target, WalGreens, Kroger to feed us. 

The kitchens in these restaurants haven’t gotten any larger, so what are you, the owner, doing to protect your workers? (No you don’t get points for hand washing and sanitizing because your food service employees should be doing that even without a global health pandemic happening). 

Are you temperature testing employees? Are you waiting for someone in government to tell you to do these things or are you being proactive?

To curb this outbreak, every single person will be required to stay home unless they’re an essential employee of a company providing essential services to those under quarantine. Isn’t keeping many of these restaurants staffed with multiple hosts, busboys waiters and cooks counter to the CDC recommendations and directives? 

If you own a couple of restaurants you probably have access to legal and financial advice; are you providing your low income and tipped employees any guidance about unemployment?

That data is hosted on a GIS (Geographic Information System) server and available for anyone to display.  The map link I am posting in this thread displays data directly from that server.  Each time you open the map you will see the most recent data.

The map has a number of COVID-19 related overlay layers that you can turn on/off/restack.  For the USA there is one overlay that shows cases by county and a different overlay that shows deaths by county.  Other overlays show cases and deaths in the USA by state, for Canada by province and for the rest of the world by country.

When the map opens, it shows the COVID cases by county.  Each symbol has the data for one county.  If you zoom in one step then county boundary lines should appear.

Please take a moment to read the **“Map tips”**.  That link is in the upper left corner.  On that page you will find the map legend and learn (1) how to make your own custom map links, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display.

Anyone out there on the front lines not actually worried?  Would like to hear their perspective. Especially if local to our situation.

Dr. Katz is one that comes to mind though not local. He was quoted in the NYT article about cure being worse than the disease.  And Deborah Birx was subtly chastising some of the inflated numbers being reported.  Of course neither are advising anyone to just ""carry on"".  Far from it.

I find this extremely hard to believe considering that I know one person that works for the nursing home in Centerton and she is sick, awaiting test results today..

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,
