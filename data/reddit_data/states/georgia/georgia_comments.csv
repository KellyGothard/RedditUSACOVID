For the third time, people who meet every requirement to vote are being swept up and removed from the roll as well. That's a problem. 

Again, would you be okay with being routinely sent a traffic ticket and forced to pay unless you provided evidence that you did not speed?

Stop it with this. We have records of people who moved and who are dead. Your third catch-all category is nonsense.

Ah! Athens is a great city to move to if you’re young (I’m super biased, I just moved there in August). As you probably know, Athens is known as “The Classic City” and University of Georgia sits right in the center. There’s also Athens tech, UNG - Oconee, and maybe a satellite campus for Piedmont college (don’t quote me on that one). 

I’m pretty sure Athens has the most bars I’ve ever seen so close together. There is plenty of nightlife, always something to do. Also, there’s this ~Athens magic~, being 19 is not an issue (I am also 19). 

Because of this being a college town, rent generally shouldn’t be too bad. If you decide to live downtown/in a luxury apartment obviously it’s going to be a little bit more. But I have 2 roommates in a house near downtown next year and my rent will be $515. Pretty affordable. What I’ve been told is the area directly west of UGA is the not so nice part of town- student was held at gunpoint a few months ago on the west campus deck and many houses in that area were broken into the past few weeks. 

I can only give limited information because I’ve been here just a few months, but I love it! I’m from Savannah, that’s worth checking out as well.

The night life is unparalleled, especially when school is in session and more so on a game day weekend. There is literally something for everyone downtown on any given night. 

As far as the music scene...well, it may not be quite what it was in its heyday, with REM, the B52s, and so many others known nationally or internationally...but it certainly still thriving. Most nights of the week you can find anything from jazz to indie to rock to hip hop to dance to covers to big shows. Again, something for everyone. 

There are certainly some areas to be cautious of, but unless you are in the worst of the worst government housing areas, there’s always good people around, even if you have to be a bit more cautious day to day. If you can, I would spend a weekend just riding around the area. That would certainly give you a better feel of what areas appeal to you and which ones do not.

If the answer is ""no"" and you want employment there will be much better opportunities in Atlanta. 

We have one employee who has to commute from Athens into Atlanta and it's brutal. 


Depending on how you count around 4.5 Million people live in the Atlanta urban area or 6.5 million in the combined statistical area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_metropolitan_area) - the close you are to the middle of this the easier it will be to find a job without a long commute. For a point of comparison Georgia as a whole has around 10.5 million people total, so depending on your counting method between around half to two thirds of the state lives in or around Atlanta. 

That said, there is some tension sometimes between ""inside the perimeter"" and ""outside the perimeter"" (inside 285 or outside 285) and especially between Atlanta and rural Georgia. The demographics, politics, and culture are fairly different between Atlanta and the rest of Georgia. This also manifests itself a bit of reddit with some tension between r/Atlanta and r/Georgia.  

Athens demographically is an exception since it's almost entirely University of Georgia (UGA) staff, students, and people working jobs that serve UGA staff or students. 

You may prefer the more rural lifestyle outside the urban center, it is much cheaper and more relaxed. It may be more like Oklahoma. But if you are looking for a job there are certainly more jobs where there are more people, which will be in the Atlanta area. 


If you are attending UGA of course, or your friend is, ignore this whole post because obviously Athens is the only place you should live.


   


    

It's about a 80 minute drive from Atlanta to Athens with no traffic, which occasionally is very optimistic. With traffic it can take two hours (120 minutes). So figure between one and two hours travel on the highway in case you need an estimate of the distance. For a commute this implies a three to four hour round trip commute - if you have an 8-10 hour shift your commute is going to be 30%-40% of your entire time working. It's just not a great experience to have such a long travel time.",1578062581,fcxgugm

From a macro perspective, it really is safer and better to move over and let them go, because otherwise they're going to swerve and weave through traffic to pass on the right.

(Speaking of which, everybody should be keeping *all the way* right *all* the time except when they're actively passing. It's not okay to cruise in the left lane even if the traffic is light.)

The crazy white thing was in the window of the Institute of Imagination, a nonprofit children's art school that does outreach with impoverished kids in the area. 

The wolves are all over town and were a university/city collaboration to try to better integrate UWG with the community. The different designs were submitted by city civic groups and University clubs. I think having open carry alcohol drinks around the square did a better job of keeping the students in Carrollton than anything, but the wolves are cool.

Stinks the food pantry you saw was empty but I'm not sure how much use the one downtown gets. There are more scattered through town and a large one by the soup kitchen which is the one we try to keep stocked. There's also the small lending library boxes everywhere too. 

The restaurants are unique and great like others have mentioned. I'll add that for a quick snack you have to grab a scone at The Highland Deli and then head nextdoor to the oldest bookstore in Georgia, Horton's Books and Gifts.",1578254958,fdb8nyi

There isn't a brewery, but there are a few brewpubs and two distilleries nearby (which I haven't been to). I've seen your comments about political stance, here's what I'll say. It's less likely that you'll run into people with very strong, outspoken republican opinions that you bristle against. It's more likely that you'll run into people with very strong *Christian* beliefs that you may have to be sensitive of. I know that seems like splitting hairs, but for many people in rural Georgia, politics only matters in terms of how it intersects with their Christianity. 

In terms of driving distance...yeah, you're pretty much out of luck. My aunt and uncle live up there and they just have to drive a lot. It's super beautiful, slow paced, and fairly moderate in terms of weather. You should be able to find people interested in board games, though. There are nerds everywhere. Otherwise, get ready for all the outdoorsy activities you could ever want. 

While I'm from GA, I lived in Boston for 2 years so I have a little perspective on that. The biggest difference is that New Englanders are like M&amp;Ms - hard on the outside, but soft on the inside. Once you're in, you're in. Southerners lean more towards being peaches - sweet on the outside, hard on the inside.

295,StabbyMcStabsauce,"So I worked at RGNS 2 years ago. I left living close to Atlanta and my friends to give it a shot up in the N. Ga mountains.  I made it one year.  The thing about RG is it's a boarding school. So most of the staff and students live on campus, and it gets a bit demanding of your personal time.  Staff becomes a bit closed off and honestly some of the people who have been there for a while seem completely detached from the real world.  They treat the kitchen staff like indentured servants for example, that was something I saw a lot of.  It made me feel jaded to be around them. 
On one hand, there are perks to living there.  It's beautiful,  there's tons of hiking, and a cool little downtown Clayton to hang out in, local produce, and foods.  Im fond of Wander (the owners are really cool) and there's a good pizza spot called Fortify Pi that's not too shabby.  Cost of living seems pretty cheap too.  You're right up the street from the NC state line, and Asheville is like 2 hours away.  Everyone seems to know or be related to everyone else.  My favorite part was all the wildlife. Being from the city I hadn't seen much more  than raccoons, opossum and the occasional deer.  Up there you gotta watch for bears and cows wandering into the road.
On the other hand, it's a super backwards town. Like as soon as you pull into the city of Clayton there's a store called The Rebel Store.  Yep, Confederate  pride in all its ugliness.  The women I worked with all seemed to have some type of PTSD from some horrible traumatic incident, and a lot of the men I came across were super racist and sexist.  There's a lot of trashy drama.  I bit my tongue a lot. During my time there I got to know some of the black kids from Atlanta.  They were great kids and very down to earth.  One night while most of the students were on a Wal Mart run I asked one of the guys why they didn't go.  They told me they weren't stupid enough to go outside the school gates and they didn't feel safe.  With a place like the ""Rebel store"" being just down the road I can't really blame them.   
So yeah.. gorgeous place. The view is different every day and it's breathtaking.  But it's also like stepping into a different time.  It would probably be a neat experience, but probably not a place you would want to stay for more than a year or two.  Especially as young as you are.",1578353104,fdf4heq

I really appreciate the recommendations for places, and Clayton seems (mostly) cooler with each post. It's likely that we would be there about a year since my wife intends to go to grad school in 2021, and it may prove to be just enough for us.

We deal with a lot of the same stuff at the school she teaches at here in MA. The older teachers in particular just eat, sleep, and breathe the school, and refuse to socialize with anyone who doesn't have at least 5 years under their belt. We go out of our way to learn the names of the kitchen and maintenance staff since a lot of teachers here won't even make eye contact with them. The younger teachers are cool but most of them are leaving at the end of this year anyway.

While not ideal to be so far away from a larger city, you're not completely out of the woods. I'm sure cost of living is substantially lower than in New England. Your wife has her great new job and you can still work remote. Excess cash flow can go toward a fun weekend every month or every other month if that's something you want to do.

The wharf is way over priced for average food. Tortuga jacks is decent tex mex with live music most of the time. The driftwood bistro is pretty good. IMO red bug pizza is garbage water sauce pizza. Best bet is to hit up Brunswick or st simons. In Brunswick you've got a ton of really good options and the drive is short with little traffic. Best places near the island would have to be jinrights-seafood. Artes-pizza. Wok-n-Roll best Chinese in town but go to the one at five points. Its doesn't look like the safest area but its safe and the food is amazing,

Further in town you've got fancy qs witch has great sushi and Willie jewels has far better BBQ compared to southern soul on st simons.

Dont worry about traffic there will prolly be more traffic on Jekyll than anywhere else because of the convention. Its a really small island. They've also just started the island treasures hunt. Its where they hide several plastic globes around the island and everyday if you find one you turn it in and get a glass globe that is supposed to represent the glass floats that fisherman used to use back in the day for there nets. 

Theres also the sea turtle center and new museum and historic tours they do that are cheap/free that are really interesting if your into that kinda thing.  The sea turtle center offers night tours on the beach during sea turtle nesting and hatching season although im not sure when that is.

The windmill is still there and is the namesake for the senior living community, Windmill Park. One of the old farm houses can be seen across the street from the windmill, and while no one lives there I believe its upkeep is maintained by a trust.",1578510534,fdkt0cd

467,DoubleZ8,"* Georgia has a primary, not a caucus. The **primary** process is nearly identical to the general election process: You vote for your preferred candidate(s) on an electronic voting machine at your assigned precinct (or at a more central location for early voting, or by mail for absentee voting). In the primary, you vote for candidates from *one party* who compete to represent their party in the general election; in the general election, which occurs several months later, you vote for your preferred candidate among *all primary winners from every party* (typically, only the largest three or four parties' primary winners appear on the ballot, and primary winners from minor parties are considered ""write-in"" candidates). The **caucus** process is a bit different than a primary, and the process can vary somewhat by state and party, but ultimately, caucusgoers vote for their preferred candidate within *one party*, like a primary. A caucus, however, usually takes place at a set time in a large, open room. Typically, supporters of each candidate gather next to signs with their respective candidates' names within the room, in a manner similar to way schoolchildren gather at one of four corners of the gym basketball court while playing ""Four Corners"" in P.E. class. In some caucuses, each candidate's supporters are then allowed to debate with one another in an attempt to win over supporters of other candidates. When those processes are complete, votes are tallied, and everybody goes home.
* Georgia's primaries will occur on **Tuesday,** **March 24, 2020**. 99% of precincts are open from 7am to 7pm. Early and absentee voting will begin prior to this date.
* To see if you're already registered, visit the Georgia My Voter Page (MVP) at [https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp) and fill in your first initial, last name, county, and date of birth. You can also register to vote, if you're not already, in about 10 minutes by visiting this site and clicking ""Register""; all you should need is your driver's license. Note that you must **register before February 24, 2020** to be eligible to vote in a primary. The MVP website is the best resource for additional voting and election information.
* Georgia is considered an ""open primary"" state. This means that **you do not need to be registered with a certain party in order to vote in that party's primary**. In fact, party registration is not really a thing in Georgia. When you arrive to your assigned precinct on primary day, you will fill out a form at a table near the entrance. On this form, you circle the party whose primary you would like to participate in. In Georgia, the options are *Democratic, Independent,* or *Republican*. I'm not certain about how to vote in a smaller party's primary.",1578604548,fdoga68
468,DataSetMatch,"&gt; BTW you have to register for a specific party (republican, Democrat or independent) to vote in that specific primary and how you register will determine which ballot you get in all elections.

Here’s my advice for OP:

Now, in case you take the test closer to Atlanta, you must: turn left at red lights, gun it at yellow lights, go at *least* 10 miles over the speed limit, never use turn signals, tailgate, and always stay in the lane with shortest line and then cut into the lane you actually need at the last possible second.

Seriously, though, I’d recommend studying the regulations manual.  The practice tests online are misleadingly easy, at least they were about a year ago.

I visited frequently and still have friends there.    The cost of living is low compared to other parts of Georgia, north of Macon.  Housing is very affordable.  

I can't speak to the public education system now, but I do know that there are private schools available.  As a kid who had never been around any people other than my own race (white), it was a bit of a shock for me to go to a school where so many kids were very poor and didn't have money for lunch and were hitting me up for money every day.  There was a lot of pot smoking  and my parents eventually put me in a private school where I thrived and made good grades.  

Macon is a very Christian town and not very diverse culturally.  It's slow-paced and probably not even much traffic.  You'll be close to beaches to the South and Atlanta to the north.  Just make sure you get a hefty pay raise in case you want to put your kids in private school and to make up for the fact that Macon is VERY hot about six months out of the year.

562,Stories-With-Bears,"As others have said, you’re unlikely to be affected. But here’s some basic tornado safety for you: a tornado WATCH means the weather conditions are favorable for a tornado to form. A WARNING means a funnel cloud has been sighted. Now, this funnel cloud may stay up in the sky and never touch down to earth. If a tornado is sighted in your area (you may receive a text telling you to take cover or there may be tornado sirens, or you may just have to be paying attention to the news) go to a room on the lowest level of your home with no windows. Preferably an interior room. Stay put until there’s an all-clear, but tornados don’t last long. Average is like 10 minutes.

That said, tornados are very localized.  The usual tornado is generally F0 or F1 and less than 100 yds wide.  You have to be extremely unlucky to have one hit you.  I am always aware of bad weather when it comes ( I've always been interested in severe weather mechanics) but don't really worry about tornados.

1. Unlikely to be affected, wrong. Having lived in a neighboring state to GA, I have to take precautions for tornadoes approximately 1 to 5 times per year. That being said, I've never had damage from a tornado, but I've definitely had close calls. Either way, a tornado warning in your county will affect you.

2. A warning means a funnel cloud has been spotted, wrong. A warning actually means that either a funnel cloud has been spotted OR the radar has indicated a POSSIBLE tornado.

3. There may be tornado sirens, wrong. There will be tornado sirens. Whether you can hear them or not is the question. Listen about midday every first Wednesday of the month for the monthly tests.

4. Average is like 10 minutes, wrong. While the actual danger of a tornado hurting you only lasts a minute or two if you're in the path, the tornado warning can easily last for 30 minutes to an hour, and the tornado itself can last that long as well.

Here's what you got right:

1. Tornado watch definition, check.

[Arabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabi,_Georgia) is a dusty south GA town with no police station but think they have a church. 
[Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Georgia)is NW and has the river going through it. NW GA has Civil War and Cherokee history. 

I live in Atlanta because I like city life but I grew up in rural NW GA. If I were to get a 2nd home in GA it would be a cabin near Blairsville or a condo in St. Simons. 

Are you a Baptist or Methodist because that's mostly what they have down here. Well, and Church or God, Jehovah Witnesses and rumors of snake handling churches. If church community is important to you I would research that. The church down the road from my house growing up required women to wear long dresses and men to wear pants... everyday. The church we went to was up on a mountain in the middle of nowhere. It was kind or racist and homophobic but we got to wear regular clothes. I am not a religious person but I recommend you do your homework. A few years back I drove through [Cylo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyo,_Georgia) in east GA to photograph some ancestors graves at [this church](http://www.jerusalematebenezer.com/about-us/). It's the oldest still active church in GA. They're lutheran whatever that's about. idk. It was founded by Protestant refugees from Salzburg. Anyway I liked the way [Cylo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyo,_Georgia) looked but then I read about a terrible [child murder](https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/exclusive-before-death-georgia-kids-endured-violent-chaos-home/x8806J4kcg7CMZaGnvJYfL/) in the county and that kind of turned me off. 

I think you will find horses, cows and chicken houses anywhere in rural GA. Chicken houses can stink... I grew up with a horse or two but I'm not sure about stables and stuff like that.

823,killroy200,"We should be actively trying to consolidate rural communities into 'Triage' towns, which could actually have large enough populations to properly support not just private business, but also public services that would otherwise be horrendously inefficient on a per-person served basis.

There are some rural towns that are either holding on, actually doing well, or could with just a little push. To me, these areas are worth saving, if only because they offer a buffer for those people who will fight to the (nearly-literal) death to not move to one of the core cities.

These 'Triage Towns' could be rallying points to consolidate local communities into. Why bother with 10, 5,000 people towns that are dying, when you can have one 50,000 person town that actually has a shot at a future? Then you can reclaim the other towns' land for new agriculture, wild-life refuges, new state parks, new managed forces, etc. Even better if you can connect these towns with high-capacity transit, and use the new influx of people to justify density and proper, if small-scale, urban development.

Triage towns would allow people to live outside of a major city, while still basically being in a city. There could still be fairly urban densities, a higher concentration of persons to improve services efficiency, and an expansion of education options that could, with targeted application of efforts, anchor at least some new commercial activity.

You'd still have large efficiency and potential productivity gains, without fully abandoning what a lot of people feel is their home, something that will be the core of any pushback no matter how much you or I quote subsidy stats at them.",1579099598,fegppcu

Carrot-and-stick methodology comes to mind, though, with relocation assistance, and visible investment in the triage towns being the carrot, while ending services to non-triage, non-sustainable areas would be the stick. That would *not* be popular, I know. Not to mention the costs of the over all program would likely make the thing dead on arrival before even considering the moral issues and stubborn-headed refusal to move. But it might be enough?

Perhaps the park/refuge designations, and the potential for jobs in ecological remediation, new construction, etc. would be enough to make it work politically? Particularly given the amount of decay and out-migration already occurring.

Plus, we've done stuff like this before as a nation, with efforts like the TVA forcing relocations, and having the Resettlement Administration (though it didn't do quite as well), so maybe there're some lessons to learn there? That's a reading idea for sure...

Then let people make their choices.

Of course, we, as a nation, have the legal ability to, if nothing else, remove persons from places slated for public works.

Not in this context.

*Research the 1950’s.* 

Fair point. Did a little bit of quick research to help increase my knowledge and understanding...

*Legalize cannabis, obviously. Expunge convictions for simple possession.*

Criminal offense in the 50s. Still a criminal offense today.

*People over 70 take bi-annual driving tests.*

Not required in the 50s. Still not required today.

*Restore the tax credit for electric cars.*

Not available in the 50s. (There were a few electric cars in the 50s.) Not available today.

*Outlaw all Sunday alcohol sales restrictions.*

Sales blocked in the 1950s. Sales blocked today. Although there were some minor improvements in 2011.

*Repeal laws giving confederate monuments special protection.*

Many confederate monuments were erected in the 1900s-1920s in association with Jim Crow laws then another surge during the 1950s-1960s as a backlash against the Civil Rights Movement. In 2019, Georgia Governor Kemp signed a bill specifically protecting such monuments and making it more difficult to relocate the monuments. Six other states have enacted similar laws. I'll leave it to the reader to guess the names of those states.

*LGBT non discrimination in employment and housing.*

""Georgia law does not protect against employee discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. However, some cities and counties in the state have enacted local ordinances banning such discrimination in varying degrees."" -[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Georgia_(U.S._state))

Lies. The statues and monuments were largely created and placed by the organization Daughters of the Confederacy, which has a history of whitewashing the Confederacy, opposing racial inequality, and perpetuating the image of content enslaved blacks and benevolent white enslavers.

&gt;Just because the Confederacy lost the war does not mean that their history needs to be erased.

False equivalence. Destroying a statue is not erasing history. History books and museum exhibits are history, statues that blindly idolize and whitewash the past are not.

&gt;According to people like you, no families from the Confederacy should've ever been sad that their sons were killed in a war.

Another false equivalence. The Germans didn't build statues to the Nazis no matter how many parents might have been sad their sons died while systematically killing Jews. We shouldn't have built and placed statues for racist traitors, *especially* during the time of the Civil Rights Act. The timing alone makes it very clear that these statues were not about history, they were about black submission.

Smithsonian Magazine, [""far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by Jim Crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over African-Americans.""](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/costs-confederacy-special-report-180970731/)

[""There were two major periods in which the dedication of Confederate monuments and other symbols spiked — the first two decades of the 20th century and during the civil rights movement.""](https://web.archive.org/web/20170816191639/https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whoseheritage_splc.pdf) SPLC

""The first began around 1900 as Southern states were enacting Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise African Americans and re-segregate society after several decades of integration that followed Reconstruction. It lasted well into the 1920s, a period that also saw a strong revival of the Ku Klux Klan. The second period began in the mid-1950s and lasted until the late 1960s, the period encompassing the modern civil rights movement."" SPLC, ibid.

&gt;Just because the confederacy lost the war does not mean that their history needs to be erased

""This is not an attempt to erase history. It is an effort to end the government’s endorsement of a symbol that has always represented the oppression of an entire race. These historical symbols belong in museums and other educational settings where people can see them and learn the full history of slavery, the Confederacy, the Civil War and Jim Crow."" SPLC, ibid.

&gt;their own heritage

""While some people see Confederate symbols as emblems of Southern pride and heritage, the question must be asked: Whose heritage? The “heritage, not hate” argument ignores the near-universal heritage of African Americans who were enslaved by the millions in the South and later subjected to brutal oppression under
the white supremacist regime of Jim Crow. Our democracy is based on equality under the law, and public entities should not prominently display symbols that undermine that concept and alienate an entire segment of the population."" SPLC, ibid.

And it is quite the stretch to go from ""we shouldn't have public, government-funded (meaning, taxpayer-funded), monuments glorifying traitors who were, at the very least, supporting a government ['[whose] foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition.'

What do you have to understand is that people can be proud of their heritage without endorsing every single thing about their ancestors did. I don’t blame Southern people for getting irritated when liberals who live half of the country away are petitioning to get rid of statues that represent the southern heritage. Saying that liberals want to erase all memories of the confederacy is not an extreme view on my part. I just wish people would get to know us other people before they make such rash judgments. The equivalent of it would be me thanking that every single person who lives in California is a socialist transgendered SJW with dyed hair and a Bernie Sanders bumper sticker on their car.

This is the same argument you're making right now. 

The Confederate flag will always represent a people who fought a war to preserve their right to treat certain people as property and as less than white people. Their monuments will ALWAYS represent the (racist) ideals that they wanted to preserve, even if they also represent a respect for our collective southern heritage. 

They don't only mean that, but you don't get to say ""this only represents being proud of our heritage, and not racism.""

1189,octaspi,"okay so,,, I think that if you’re looking for typical s m a l l small towns then you should try Pembroke, maybe. houses can be pretty cheap, for ex. I found a 3 bed house for rent that’s only $800 a month. unfortunately, this town is the small type of small; there are basically no actual stores that people would know around here (there’s not even a Walmart there, I’m pretty sure-). it’s about a 40 minute drive from savannah, which I think is the closest city-like town (but it’s not city, no big buildings or anything, more over just a big town,). 
if you’re thinking about a more normal, quiet town kind of deal, I think that Rincon could also work. There are actually normal stores there (supercenters, fast food chains, etc.), so don’t need to worry about that. the houses are a tiny bit more expensive, for example a 3 bed 2 bath could be $1000 a month or higher, but I also found a house that’s only $950 a month for 3 bed. 
if Rincon is too expensive, and Pembroke isn’t really an option, then you should try Port Wentworth. It’s like Rincon, only it has a bit more of a small town type of feeling without actually being one. Also, it’s a bit less expensive. The houses in the northern, newer part of Port Wentworth can be a bit expensive, an example being the houses at Rice Creek, which can be about $1400 a month for a 3 bed. At the southern part, the more historical district type, the houses are a lot cheaper; like $900 for a 3 bed. However, there aren’t really any normal stores in the southern part, which is where I recommend you should look to live at. But good news, it’s just literally not even a minute away from garden city, where they have normal stores lol.
Okay so the last place I recommended is Garden City. This one you should probably avoid, considering that it’s not exactly the best place to live, and can honestly get really ghetto. The houses here can get pretty cheap, I’ve actually lived there before and I had a $850 for 3 bed 1.5 bath. Now however, they seem to be getting higher up in price, like a $950 for a 2 bed apartment. This place does have some normal stores tho.
Overall, I think that Rincon is the best choice, but that’s just me. Garden City is probably the worst, considering that it’s more expensive houses in places where they shouldn’t be expensive. Anyways I hope that this will help oof. :’’’’’’’’)",1579327635,fepq7r4
1190,octaspi,"if you’re looking for small small towns, then pembroke might be for you!! most houses there are relatively cheap, but there aren’t really much normal stores, so you might have to drive to a more populated town to get things.

Their goal was to whitewash history.

97.7 Is alternative rock station in Atlanta which plays alternative rock from the late 70's - 2010's, it fades out a little north of Gainesville.

105.7 and 100.5 are also Rock stations that come in, in Atlanta, I like what I've heard of them but both pretty much fade out after you get north of Buford so I've never been able to listen to them much because of this. They both seem to be alternative rock from at least the 80's - 2010's.

98.5 plays songs from the 80's - present, mostly present. It broadcasts in Atlanta and comes in at least as far north as Dawsonville.

1317,Kateab06,"I graduated from Rabun Gap back in ‘07 and then spent about 10 years between Atlanta, DC and NYC, and just recently within the past couple years made the move back up here to the mountains (I work from home). From personal experience, the school itself has a wonderful community, and at least when I was there, there were quite a few teachers in the 30~ age range, including couples, and they had a great social network really built in...especially living on campus. We actually had a lot of teacher spouses/parents who found random things on campus to volunteer with just to be apart of the school more. Regarding making the move outside of the super-convenience of the Northeast/major metropolitan areas, it is an adjustment, but I’ve been able to find plenty of social outlets. Everyone so far is right in that downtown Clayton has a pretty decent food/and even bar scene (there’s even this cool rooftop bar now, another bar with this nice big patio that always has events going on, a solid vegan/vegetarian restaurant, and of course plenty of BBQ/Southern food options). Cost of living is hardly anything compared to pretty much anywhere up North. More outdoor activities than you could imagine...and depending on what kind of games you like to play there’s a card shop like 15 minutes north in Franklin where they host events. As long as you aren’t tied to major chain places on a daily bases, there’s actually a decent active social scene if you just find the right places. And if you need a city, it’s a straight shot down the highway like 1:45 min, but it’s an easy quick drive....just try to avoid Atlanta traffic :).",1579518613,ff2pydg

1379,americanaerospace1,"Forsyth County schools are some of the best in the state (first, often ranked higher than Decatur on sites I see, and as a student, I can say they are great. I can go more into that if wanted). Parts of the county have very affordable COL and not many people. The highly populated areas of Alpharetta/John's Creek/South Cumming are filled with people, subdivisions, etc (higher COL). If you go to north or west Forsyth county though, there are significantly fewer people, and the COL is a good bit cheaper than South Forsyth from what I know. Also imo, some of the best elementary schools and middle schools aren't just in south Forsyth, but all around the county. There's also a bunch of undeveloped land, so who knows what will go there. 

On the topic of city centers, Cumming's is notorious for being really bad for two reasons.

1. There is a Tyson chicken plant which smells bad sometimes (I personally am not bothered really).
2. The infrastructure in the city limits was built when the county was 50x smaller in population. 

This really has prohibited any real city center with shops and restaurants from appearing, but thankfully, about a mile away from the town center (far enough away from the chicken plant) they are building ""Cumming City Center"", a 1950's themed shopping/business center.

Now, the commute to the perimeter is a bit longer than Decatur/Alpharetta/John's Creek, but I believe it's more affordable than all those cities, and has equally as good (if not better) schools (John's Creek and Alpharetta fall into south Forsyth).

Now, if I have one complaint about the county, it's just the influx of people. But it's really just people like you wanting to look for a great county in Georgia. Subdivisions are being built left and right, but there is still land that could be bought and a house built on, without a subdivision. (Any questions about Forsyth, I might be able to answer).

Decatur may be a better option though, as it is a better balance of everything you want, rather than focusing more on one thing. What I will say, is I would not suggest anything inside Atlanta city limits. North Fulton county (which used to be Milton county, a long time ago) is the nicest, though populated area of Georgia.

The Georgia Dot said they could not issue me a ticket or a license until my NC matter was cleared up, of course I could fight it in court. 

The NC people told me I could pay the fine or fight it in court. I had no active Georgia license so I paid over $300 in fines so I could legally drive in Georgia.

That line is typical of speeding ticket attorneys, and ignores that fact that an officer’s visual estimation of your speed is equally as admissible as evidence gained by electornic means.

This is a huge misunderstanding of the laws around speed detection devices in Georgia. 

Georgia *does* have a whole series of laws surrounding the use of speed detection drivers which, on the whole, are incredibly driver-friendly relative to the rest of the country.

Those laws have nothing to do with concerns about ""their reliability"" and everything to do with putting restrictions on how and where detection devices are used. They were passed to curtail predatory speed trapping by small municipalities as a revenue source and notably do not apply at all the the GSP.

There are absolutely cases where an attorney familiar with the law can get a speed detection reading thrown out -- police cars running stationary radar must be plainly visible for at least 500', so a reading from a cop hiding behind a proverbial billboard is inadmissible, for example -- but it's absolutely not a get out of jail free card because the radar gun might somehow magically be unreliable.

1) The cuts in personnel, including I assume the cut in ""Second Thought"" were NOT part of the state-mandated budget cuts.

2) The station's revenues from the Board of Regents (it's part of Georgia State University) was described as ""flat over the last several years"" but in the letter, they also said revenues have more than doubled from ""other sources"" which almost certainly means their twice-yearly fund-raising drives. Of course, THOSE amounts were not revealed in the letter, so we got no idea what that means to the station, but I have read that in general public broadcasting stations have lost so much funding from government that they are depending mostly on money from fund drives to survive. Could be different for GPB, I dunno.

The letter cites FCC-mandated upgrades to seven of their nine transmission towers and renovations to their offices (not renovated since 1997, oh my!) as expenditures that made them $5 million over budget last year.

But they also refer to losses of various staff members and ""efficiencies"" such as (I presume) cutting ""Second Thought"" back from a weekday show to a once a week show repeated on the weekends. So I'm thinking of all those nice renovated but now empty offices. A shame.

It still doesn't add up, but since I don't have the raw numbers, I got nothing but a vague feeling. Still, kinda obvious what's going on: they're cutting back on content and upgrading their towers and offices. What's going on with the ""doubled"" funds from ""other sources""?

The spring is still there, but it flows under the Midtown Place parking lot, under Piedmont Park, and eventually emerges at Clear Creek.

I did 2 unpaid internships at the Zoo during school, and although I got some hands on experience I wouldn't trade for anything and a job that was still hands-on-animals in education... it capped at $10/hour. As in, there are enough people that wanted that job that they will never value you more than that. Since I had just had a very similar experience at the Aquarium (unpaid internship, led to a seasonal guest services job that capped at $12/hr, left it after the season ended to try the Zoo) and I met someone who had been there for EIGHTEEN YEARS in the same education job at $10/hour, I realized I needed to move on from the industry as whole and got into nutrition for a few years before going all the way back to school for graphic design.

To add: I caught up with the Keeper II that I interned under and she left the field completely and went back to school for H.R. to make more money. This both surprised me and didn't because she was SO passionate about those animals, so it must have been pretty bad salary wise further up the flow chart too.

Since you like wildlife, I would check out AWARE which is a little outside of Atlanta, probably 30 mins from the zoo. It’s a wildlife rehab facility, it’s relatively easy to start volunteering and it sounds more up your alley. As the only physical rehab facility in Ga, they need all the help they can get lol. They see interesting cases all the time.

&gt;""It’s so selfish of Doug Collins to be promoting himself when President Trump needs a unified team and Senator Loeffler is such a warrior for the President,” said Steven Law, the president of Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “As we've said before, Senator Loeffler is an outsider like Trump, not just another D.C. politician. We’ll have her back if she needs us.""

Loeffler has been working overtime attaching herself to Trump and his agenda, despite not being his pick for the Senate seat. But...are statements like this a window into how the GOP is really feeling towards Trump? Are they worried that a fight between Loeffler and Collins will end up being a fight for who is more a Trump cheerleader than the other, especially as the impeachment is looking less like an easy acquittal? 

In my opinion I think that if the GOP campaigns become a 'who can sell Trump better' that the moderate Georgian Republican voters are going to be weary of the same message and may just stay home.",1580309116,ffwrb0d

So that fact that donald is a reflection of your values, ethics, and morality tells the world the ""type"" of person you are.

But if you’re asking for a comparison, then I’ll say that it’s way more crowded here. Winters are much more mild, and the Atlanta area is much more culturally diverse than I remember Alaska being, or many other places In the south for that matter. While beautiful in its own right, nature in the south doesn’t hold a candle to what Alaska has to offer. Cost of living is relatively cheap, and we’re geographically situated in an advantageous location, both in terms of driving distance to places of interest, and in terms of being regularly exposed to natural disasters.

I think we need a major overhaul in education that fixes this overlap, but I don’t think the way to do this is to take funding away from dual enrollment because the end game there is that students foot the bill for college classes and those colleges profit off of them. Someone else here proposed combining dual enrollment and HOPE/Zell Miller, I’d be interested in seeing how that would work if it would benefit the students in the long run and not just be another way for the state to cut money/services for its citizens while also cutting taxes for the wealthy. This has been a major issue in Georgia recently and it’s why there are so many budget cuts being proposed.

The judge was at least generous enough to waive the ticket to non-reportable, but if you're still wanting the full money for the offense and dropping the insurance penalty doesn't that just make it look more like it is about generating revenue than punishing people or teaching them lessons?

I'd say more of my proof would just seeing the sheer number of cops sitting at the minimum spot away from the drop sign in small towns as more of the evidence of it, but like another poster said it is very common in smaller towns all across the US. Some places got so bad at it that they lost their own ability to have a police force like Waldo in Florida. One place near me that sticks out is Nicholson. It's 45mph within the town (though it probably could stand to be 55) with it being 65 leading into it with a short 55 period. But it is almost always patrolled by state troopers. Again, anecdotal and not actual proof but seems others have a similar sentiment here.

All of the 40-14s are restrictions on agencies other than GSP using detection devices, and the reason none of them apply to GSP is the state only gets 5% of the fine for tickets written by troopers. The remaining 95% and any fees goes to the county or municipality the ticket was written in.",1580751702,fgg0o8g

This is a common misconception. There is no minimum distance other than the 500’ visibility requirement.   

&gt; Some places got so bad at it that they lost their own ability to have a police force like Waldo in Florida.   

The same thing can and has happened in GA, but since the mess with Ludowici in the 1970s the speed enforcement laws are heavily in favor of the motorist. If a LEA is deriving more than 35% of their budget from fines for speeding between 10-20 over, the state can and will yank their radar permit. All of the 40-14s are limits on what the locals can do.

2183,stealthone1,"&gt; This is a common misconception. There is no minimum distance other than the 500’ visibility requirement.

I did not know that. So in theory an officer could sit literally at a speed limit sign as long as it was visible at 500'? Interesting but seems reasonable.

&gt; Nicholson doesn’t have it’s own PD, and AFAICT never has. I’m guessing you’re going through on 441, thus the troopers.

I did not know that they never have had one, but I guess it isn't surprising given how small of a town it is. And yeah my commute takes me on 441 so that is one of the stops along my path. Commerce/Bank's crossing is similar too with the enforcement but they're more often the sheriffs' office or Commerce PD than state troopers. But I also play it safe near there as well despite most traffic seeming to want to go at least 10 over. I just get in the right hand lane and cruise slowly until it goes back up to 65.

Everyone who showed up got something.  Even the girl who would have lost her license for too many speeding tickets was told to work something out with the prosecutors to avoid it.  Another guy with a possession charge was given a second 30 day extension to find a lawyer.  If nolo was in your interest the judge recommended it.

Honestly not familiar with the case law around it, but what I was able to find from a quick search does seem to indicate that the visibility requirement, as a practical matter, does essentially mean an officer running radar at 501 feet from a sign could write a ticket. 

That said, the signage law isn't *totally* useless - the visibility requirement only applies to *stationary* radar while the signage statute applies to *all* speed detection readings. There's admittedly a pretty narrow set of cases where that'd apply, but it's there.

If there are any applicable cases I've missed though, I'd definitely be happy to read up further.

&gt; and also of note with it is that it doesn’t apply to university police.

True, but as a practical matter, it's a huge YMMV. Campus police can only issue citations within 500 yards of campus. I know that both my local university and school district police departments don't even bother getting their officers radar certified as a result, for example. 

(They also both highly discourage their officers from making *any* stops off campus as a matter of policy, but that's, again, very YMMV).",1580917476,fgm3s7l

2303,literallyatree,"&gt;If enacted, \[the law\] would require Georgia’s licensing boards to grant expedited licenses by endorsement to military spouses who meet three criteria: They must already have a valid professional license and be in good standing for the job that they wish to perform; they must already meet the majority of Georgia’s mandated licensing requirements; and they must be married to a service member who was transferred to Georgia.

2304,KushMaster5000,"There's no reason to take the comments personally. A bit of wherewithal should be clear that up.  

There are civilians that have to move for work alllll the time, with zero government assistance. 

The last thing we need is even more money going into this never-ending money sink that is the military industrial complex. 

Especially when some military personnel are getting things like free/reduced housing. The fact that they aren't having to spend that $1,000/month is such an enormous leg up, it's incomparable to the rest of us that are fighting alone. 

There are much more pressing issues. One big one I can think of is the squeeze that is occurring in our police departments. I know someone in a Georgia department. They're being overworked and new hires getting less benefits than ever before (Kemp's new policies).

2317,burrowowl,"&gt; I always wondered how the wooden top floor (Heaven) was able to handle turning into a trampoline during every performance. The floor would deflect a couple of inches, easy.

Because wood flexes a lot before it breaks, and bounces back. Yeah, yeah, I know you're thinking ""no shit, Sherlock"".

Normally floor beams are designed to flex no more than L/360 (or L/180 if you're feeling sassy) at most (in the middle, usually) where L is the length of the floor. They do that not because it's dangerous to flex more, but because people really hate it when their floors move. It's unsettling.

How far wood will flex before it breaks depends on a bunch of factors like age, how dry it is, species, grains, knots, and a lot of other shit that I learned to pass the test at gatech way back in the day and don't remember any more.

The Mall of GA and Sugarloaf Mills aren't too far away though. Gainesville itself doesn't really have a ton to do.

- Athens being about 50 minutes away was nice, it wasn't too far. Atlanta being about an hour away (in good traffic) was also nice, it didn't feel like it was too far away. It also didn't take long to get to the mountains.

- I enjoyed walking by the lake, I never got out on it with a boat though.

- The schools I attended were pretty good, most of the students were nice and the schools were ranked prerty well.

Haha but in all seriousness, as far as I know we don’t really have much of a “flood season.” We have a burn ban during the summer in several regions of Georgia, when there’s likely to be less rain, but storms can pop up and last for days pretty much whenever.

I’m not much of a science person, but my guess is that our flooding has a lot to do with our terrain. We’re very, very hilly, so when it rains enough, the water pools. And it can rain all year round, including winter (we rarely get thick snow and it VERY rarely sticks for more than a few days.)

Edit: I can’t speak for all regions of Georgia (we’re a lot bigger than many people realize!) but I will say that though flooding is a serious concern when home-hunting (we were cautious of ground-level apartments in particularly hilly complexes, for example), it’s not like we grow up needing to fear flooding season, ya know? It’s a concern to take into account when buying &amp; building, but it’s not like, say, monsoon season in some other regions, if that makes sense.",1581218197,fh1mhvp

Why don't we have incentives were if a doctor has a high patient health rate they get paid generously?  This creates?  How do we accomplish this?  Simple.  We force doctors to keep metrics on their patient success.  We also force individuals to be held to account if they go on week long binges of alcohol and fast food rather then getting proper rest and you had to account for these things if you want government assistance because it isn't your money it is tax payers.

And those positive effects would only be improved upon under a single-payer system. There's no argument against that. It's fact.

Yes

In this particular case, because Israel does some pretty fucked up shit to the Palestinians who live alongside them.  Boycotting Israel is a nonviolent way of showing your disapproval of Israel's actions against the Palestinian people.

2942,beskartuxedo,"Clickbait title, missing important information, and misleading statistics. 

First, new voter registrations outpace voter roll purges due to the automatic voter registration program that registers someone when they are issued a drivers license. The Sept 12, 2019 AJC article (which is cited but oddly not linked) states that almost 700,000 of the 900,000 new registrations were due to the automatic registration program. That's over 75%. So not only does this article fail to mention that 75% of new voter registrations were automatic, it fails to mention the program entirely.

Second, the ""share of voters aged 18-34 has increased by 68% over the last three years"" statistic is misleading because GA implemented automatic voter registration program - surprise surprise - three years ago. Most people get their licenses around 18; hence registration in that age bracket skyrocketed due to the automatic registration. Misleading statistic because the source of most of the increase (automatic registration) isn't discussed, implying there has been some huge registration drive when there has not been.

Finally, at the end of the Sept 12, 2019 AJC article, you'll find two little throwaway tidbits at the bottom: the amount of rejected absentee ballots in the 2018 gubernatorial election (the one in controversy) was actually *lower* than it was in 2016 and 2014, and Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was 12th lowest among all 29 states that allow absentee ballots for any reason. Also, in the linked PBS article, of the 313,000 voters whose registrations were at risk this past October, only 5000 voted or responded to the mailed notices to prevent their registration from being removed. That's about 1.6% of the at-risk voters. And that 313,000 only represents 4% of all registered voters in GA. 1.6% of 4% is a minuscule number...like 0.00068%.

3072,anotherkeebler,"You're fine. A jury summons means you've been asked (told) to come and (maybe) be part of a jury at a trial.

Before I start I should ask, is this a grand jury summons? Those are completely different.

Anyway: [All U.S. citizens](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/george-w-bush-shows-jury-duty-dallas-n404661) are expected to serve when summoned, though different jurisdictions have different rules on who might be exempt. 

There is a _lot_ of weeding out that happens before an actual trial starts, and chances are high you won't be empaneled (meaning you're selected to be part of a jury at an actual trial).

Here are the general steps:

* There's probably something on the summons that lists valid exemptions and deferrals. For example the permanently disabled, or people over 70 might be exempt. People living in the jurisdiction temporarily (like maybe you?) will also get a pass but they'll want you to call and explain. Some people can get a deferral (""The summons is scheduled during midterms."")
* The summons may have a tear-off sheet that asks some simple questions (""Are you active military?"" ""Do you have insurance through State Farm, Travelers, or Allstate?"") that you're supposed to mail in. Fill it out truthfully.
* There's probably a phone number or URL on the summons you're supposed to check like after 6:00 PM the day before you're to appear. A recorded message will tell you whether to show up.
* If you show up you'll _probably_ end up sitting in a waiting room for several hours, then be sent home. A few weeks later, a check for $30 comes in the mail.
* If you're not sent home you and maybe 30 other candidates will be brought into a courtroom and asked some ""show of hands"" questions: ""Have you ever been personally affected by domestic violence?"" for example, if there's going to be a domestic violence case. You'll either be sent back to the waiting room or told to stay. This cycle can happen several times.
* If you're told to stay, you may be asked questions by both lawyers and the judge. ""What was your experience with domestic violence?"" ""Have you seen any news stories concerning the death of Amanda Hugginkiss?"" Based on the answers, either lawyer (or the judge) may send you back to the waiting room.
* If you pass through all those steps, you will be empaneled—you're on the jury. You're there until the trial ends.
* Or one of the lawyers chickens out and you're sent home.
* Or you stay for a trial that's usually a few hours or a few of days, or it's over when it's over.

I've received maybe 10 summons in my lifetime and never been empaneled.

A lot of people bitch about jury duty, but it's part of the Social Contract. If you are accused of a crime, you have the right to be tried by a jury. In exchange for that right, you may be asked to _serve_ on a jury.",1582071882,fi25fgx

Be prepared to sit all day. You probably won’t be chosen anyway, but answer the questions truthfully. They will want to know where you live, what you do (student), what you are studying, etc. They are trying to get a snapshot you to decide if they want you on the jury panel. It’s really interesting, but boring and the hard wooden benches in our courthouse hurt my butt. You will also get paid. I think it’s 35.00 a day?

The US is trying to box them out economically right now (Huawei, tariffs, sanctions) and if that doesn't work they're laying the groundwork to prepare the US populace to support conventional war with China because they're fixing to surpass us both technologically and economically.

That said, you're right about atrocities. They do plenty bad things and I'm not supporting China. I'm just trying to get an objective look at the situations and politics surrounding what's going on.

3142,UnexpectedWings,"Wow, this got more traction than I thought. I wanted to clear up a few things. I didn’t mean this to be super conspiracy sounding, but I was a bit drunk and mad. I was trying to sound funny, and came out unhinged.

The purge information I have is from newspaper articles floating around right now, as well as watching the active lawsuits over Brian Kemp’s handling of his own election, plus anecdotal evidence from my own life about who has lost their voting status.

The scary thing to me about this was that I do not meet any of the established criteria for a voter purge (I do understand those circumstances!) I have not had an address change, become an inactive voter, died, change in martial status, arrest, etc. The only different things I’ve done is become more active in politics and donate to Bernie Sanders. My family, whom I live with, is the control group. That was the only difference between us.

I’m speaking with my elected officials to figure out what happened. Is it my disability? My new found political activism (admittedly on the side against those in power in an active battleground state.) Was it an accident? I tend to ascribe more to incompetence than malice. However, given the shady nature of current GA politics, I’m more skeptical than ever.

Aren't the sponsors  of HB 847 overreaching a bit if they believe they're restricting interstate commerce with this bill?    
If  the law relates only to hemp farming/processing within the state, wouldn't  it still be possible to acquire federally approved hemp flower from  another state? I see nothing in the bill preventing that.  
Vaping  or even smoking hemp flower is not being made illegal. Georgia is  not  following North Carolina's proposed legislation.  They are, however,  restricting Georgia farmers from a rather lucrative way to sell their hemp crop; and that is ridiculous.

&gt; Researchers started with a dozen people — six cannabis smokers and six non-smokers. In the first experiment, all 12 subjects spent an hour together in a small **unventilated** room, during which time each smoker went through 10 “high-potency” [joints](https://weedmaps.com/learn/dictionary/joint/) (with 11.3% THC content). Afterward, the non-smokers reported feeling “pleasant,” more tired, and less alert. And sure enough, their blood and urine tests came up positive for [THC](https://weedmaps.com/learn/dictionary/tetrahydrocannabinol-thc/).    
&gt;  
&gt;The second experiment repeated the scenario, but this time in a room **with** **ventilation**. The non-smokers in this experiment later said they felt “hungry” — the study did also finish up around lunchtime — but none of them tested positive for any noticeable amount of THC.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers concluded that being exposed to marijuana smoke under “extreme conditions” can indeed give non-smokers a contact buzz. Outside of that very limited scope, though, any secondhand effects you might feel around cannabis smoke are likely to be the result of the power of suggestion.

3493,lowcountrygrits,"Subject line - Legalize Marijuana (Reduce the burden on our legal system)

Legalize marijuana and expunge the records of those charged with non-violent possession and reduce the burden on our over taxed legal system. Republicans fear-mongering over the legalization of recreational marijuana has proven to be false based on all available data.

Marijuana possession led to nearly 6 percent of all arrests in the United States in 2017 according to FBI data.
https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/persons-arrested

But the figure obscures the considerable variations in enforcement practices at the state and local levels. In many areas of the country in 2016, more than 20 percent of all arrests stemmed from pot possession, according to newly released from the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data. The figure exceeds 40 percent in a handful of counties, topping out at nearly 55 percent in one Georgia county. The data shows that Dooley County, Ga., has the highest rate of marijuana arrests in the nation. Out of 422 total arrests in 2016, 230, or 54.5 percent, were for marijuana possession.

https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/37059#

These numbers illustrate how marijuana enforcement continues to make up a big part of many police agencies’ caseloads.

A recent survey of US residents found that nearly 80% support recreational marijuana legalization; even 56% of **Republicans** now support legalization.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/support-for-marijuana-legalization-hits-new-high-cbs-news-poll-finds/

A September 2019 poll found 55% of Americans favor “recategorizing drug offenses from felonies to civil offenses” such that they “would be treated like minor traffic violations rather than crimes.”
https://www.cato.org/blog/55-americans-favor-decriminalizing-drugs

A 2019 study from Kansas State University found that legalization of Marijuana was NOT linked to increase traffic deaths in states where the plant was legalized.

https://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/39647

Meanwhile, we seem to turn a blind eye to the impact of alcohol, which causes nearly 90,000 deaths each year according to the CDC's own data yet there is not a single overdose death from marijuana over the last 40+ years.

https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm

Financially, it is estimated the national legalization of Marijuana could generate $132B in federal tax revenues, create over 1M jobs and bring $250-350M in tax revenue to Georgia. Think about how that money could be used towards improving our schools, health system, raising teacher salaries or rebuilding crumbling infrastructure.

The groups lobbying hardest against medical cannabis here are the prison industry, sects of evangelical Christians, and the police lobbies.

I’m one of the chronic pain patients that went up to the capitol and lobbied hard to pass the Georgia’s Hope bill for medical exceptions. The republican senators who voted no on the bill cited  moral issues about cannabis and addiction. The senator that sponsored us was saying that the best way was to emphasize that medical WOULD NOT lead to general legalization, because the sheriff’s office opposed general legislation, but were okay with medical exceptions. I frequently emphasized that to fence sitters.

I support legalization for many reasons. It’s not “big pharma” that stands in the way, because they can make big money off of cannabis legalization.

The other issue is that there is A LOT of misinformation about cannabis use out there. Presenting new data to people whose only idea of cannabis comes from reefer madness changes minds. If you want legalization, convince the police and the churches! 

Interestingly, you can see the state leader’s mindset if you look at the medical cannabis laws: It is legal for certain patients are allowed to take low THC strains. However, growing your own is still illegal. Transporting it across state lines is illegal. If you take meds that require drug testing or get drug tested at work, and you turn up positive? You will be treated like a criminal. So the law looks good and progressive on paper, but there is no legal way to use the cannabis. This law was passed in 2015.

A 2019 law granted the ability for 6 companies to produce low THC oil for medical use. However, I can’t find (using a quick google search) that any are currently producing it for GA’s hope patients. 
[Here’s a source!](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/for-georgia-patients-medical-marijuana-legal-but-not-for-sale/8Siq1vOorZ1ouj8VfUhHeK/amp.html) 

It’s a tangled mess here in GA, with outdated morality, misinformation, and the for profit prison industry leading the way. A lot of it is social ills. Getting high is something that is associated with minorities, drug dealers, gangs, atheism, class warfare, laziness, etc. If that is your (misguided) conception of marijuana users, then you’ll vote against it. 

(TL;DR Legalization has its opponents in evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity, outdated scientific information, and the justice lobby (police, for profit prison, sheriff, etc
Even medical patients are denied their treatment. The “problem” is the THC, getting high, and all the attendant factors that go with it.)",1582306555,fiaqq8m

Thank you again...,1582307257,fias02l
3523,UnexpectedWings,"Part of the issue with Cannabis being illegal is that it’s a huge boon to the justice industry. Keeping bodies (especially black and brown bodies) filling beds makes them money. Cannabis is the easiest way to do this! People are more free about using it because it’s only a misdemeanor or the police say they won’t arrest or ticket for it (like in Gwinnett)! By itself, in a perfect word, you’d walk out with a misdemeanor (which we won’t go into how much of a detriment that is on your life).

However, Marijuana being illegal is a godsend for the justice industry. In tee for profit prison industry bodies = $$$$. Especially black and brown bodies. Police can use marijuana as a stepping stone for other charges to tack on. They disproportionately use it as justification for searches, and can tack it on to lesser sentences to now make it a big sentence. Driving distracted becomes a DUI if marijuana is found. Not to mention the black marks against you for misdemeanor and felony charges. 

While you might, especially if you are middle class, white, and non threatening, actually get off with a misdemeanor... that’s a gamble for other people. Especially “non desirables”: blank and brown bodies, poor, homeless, working class, Non-Christian.. there’s a lot more to it than the technical sense.

Besides, if it’s so harmless as to drop down to a misdemeanor and that some police say “We’ll ignore it if you weren’t selling...”, then why is it still illegal? It can’t be for any of the reasons our legislative cling to, but the facts don’t match up.

Thank you for getting me to think about this.",1582307633,fiaspd2

3525,UnexpectedWings,"My pleasure! Feel free to ask me anything. There are groups around GA that her medical cannabis to people as a form of civil disobedience, including one of our Senators! Talking online actually does a lot of good, as long as you are educating fencesitters or actively debating.

I’m disabled with a rare disease. I’m in chronic pain 24/7. I’m on heavy duty around the clock pain meds, like fentanyl. I pass lots of kidney stones. I lobby because I’ve never been able to try cannabis. I would rather take edibles than fentanyl for pain. THC is the component of cannabis that relieves pain. I can’t even try it, even though I have a medical use card.

CBD oil doesn’t help me with the chronic pain. But I can’t try it either. Under GA law, I’m still breaking the law if I posses low THC products. Even more than that, the law is so that if I pop positive on my drug test for pain meds (this makes sure you aren’t abusing them) I will lose access to my insurance and medical care. 

All because people want to put black bodies in prison and Christians want to dictate my medical care by morality. I confronted both potential state governors about medical cannabis (it was on the news if you can find it). Kemp gave me a pat answer like “we’re committed to looking into” (politic speech for this isn’t a priority, pls go away). Casey Cagle couldn’t actually look into my face as he read his spiel of being against it. Stacy Abrahms agreed with me and planned to fight for it.

Anecdotal, but here we are. Write your representatives, or better yet, go talk to them! Vote them out if they aren’t amenable. In this state, for cannabis, the best thing you can do is vote blue and go debate evangelical churches to change their minds. Minorities for Marijuana is a great group that can get you started!

It gets worse than that too because some courts will issue a felony warrant for someone who is only wanted for a misdemeanor. They're basically using unethical legal tapdancing to attach a felony warrant to ensure that the authorities will pick the individual up.

So, where this leads is you can end-up having a warrant getting served, but absolutely no further action being taken, yet, the warrant can still show-up on background checks, sometimes for life depending on the specifics, and you end-up with a person who never had a case against them having to carry the word ""felony"" around forever. When they apply for certain jobs, at-best, they'll be asked to ""clear their name"" from a mere warrant that had no trial or conviction. It's not the easiest thing to ""clear your name"" when the only entity that can do so attached a felony warrant to a misdemeanor and doesn't want to admit to its wrongdoing. I can't imagine how many people got completely ghosted after a mere warrant popping-up. These scenarios are basically like being convicted in the court of public opinion without a trial. 

I know this story is about actual felons, but the way the system is set-up now, even people with mere warrants get punished for things they were never even tried for, so the current system needs to be scrapped.",1582665986,firka14

3819,BeastMesquite,"The article is incorrect. There are numerous exceptions to what can be expunged, and even expunged records do show-up in certain circumstances. One issue is that large private companies often do background checks for certain employers, and do not update their records once expungement occurs. The damage is usually already done once the person finds-out that this is the case.

Another issue is there are people who received warrants issued by the military for things that aren't even crimes in the civilian sector. These warrants never disappear and cancel-out many veterans right to not disclose their military service if they desire. These instances are one example of where you'll see a felony warrant issued for pseudo-crimes when the actual ""crimes"" the suspect is accused of are considered military-equivalency misdemeanors when(if) they actually go to trial. Civilian courts also use these types of pseudo warrants to ensure that people who are suspected of lesser crimes get held by authorities. So, if you have someone who is issued a warrant for a pseudo-felony in Atlanta, how do you think they're going to be treated when they get pulled over for speeding by the cops in another state who don't know anything about the case surrounding the supposed felony, which is actually a misdemeanor?(I know this is kind of a tangent, but I'm just trying to paint the full picture)

Also, even if a record is expunged, many agencies have access to classified information that has already been expunged. This creates numerous problems. An example of one of these problems is if John Smith is arrested, and the police arrest the wrong John Smith because there are 300 people with that name in their city, poor John could get denied a job that demands a security clearance of some sort. Sure, John could probably get a court to help him clear his name, but how we do know that the logistics of doing so will wipe the slate clean before John's life trajectory is severely altered? 

You're exactly right that it should be almost automatic. A person who has done absolutely nothing wrong shouldn't ever have to explain themselves.  I wish we could rely on our fellow humans to look at things objectively and dig deeper when they see someone has a warrant, but there are too many Just-World Fallacy addicted folks who have blind faith in the system and interpret a warrant as meaning ""he wouldn't have a warrant if he wasn't doing something suspicious.""",1582748829,fiuv4jb

3843,bigbadboomer4bernie,"It may be possible to get your primary care physician or a dentist to prescribe antibiotics to help deal with the infection and the pain if you explain that you have an appointment with a dentist but it won't be until May and the pain is here and now. The antibiotics will kill the pain after a couple of days and then you can go about getting treatment in a timely manner without suffering constantly.

If no doctor or dentist will help you (surprisingly common) and you can't find any short term help of any kind (hint: pain killers won't handle a bad tooth infection, the pain will get worse and eat right through them) then the last resort is Fish Mox, which is Amoxicillin for aquariums. It's basically Amoxicillin, the same thing dentists often treat tooth infection with. Comes in 500 mg tabs, just like the human Amoxicillln, because it's the same drug with a different number/shape.

No, you don't need a prescription to get FishMox. But taking it on your own can be dangerous.  FishMox, like any antibiotic, has to be taken in the recommended amounts and for its full course (long after the pain is gone) because if you don't do that, you risk creating [antibiotic-resistant bacteria](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/index.html) in your body, and they can kill you. Fortunately, it's not at all difficult to find the recommended dosages of Amoxicillin for adults with dental infections online.

However you get the antibiotics, they can kill the infection but they won't change the conditions that created the infection, which means you'll likely get it again if you don't get help. So you still need to get help for that, but at least you can do so without agonizing pain driving your decision making process.

All of this would be unnecessary if physicians and dentists cared about helping poor people, or temporarily embarrassed millionaires as we call ourselves, but most of them don't.

Do you have a source? I don't think that's true based on the pictures and descriptions of the system that I've seen. The ballot is printed by a laser printer attached to the touchscreen balloting machine.  In any case, if the mark the machine makes is in the form of a barcode, the voter cannot verify it.

Why not let the VOTER check that their ballot matches their selections?  Why keep pushing it down the line?  Hand-marked paper eliminates a step in the chain I must place trust into to begin with.   I do not understand the insistent argument DEMANDING the voter not be able to verify their own ballot.

Nothing allows me to know as a voter that the content of the QR code is the same content that's been printed in text.   It is literally a fatal flaw of an otherwise workable system.

4190,Dathlos,"Reminder that a big mover in Walmart's healthcare is CVS Health/Caremark, which is a PBM that heavily lobbies in the Georgia State Legislature to block Medicaid expansion.

PBMs or Pharmacy Benefit Management companies act as a prescription middleman for GA patients. PBMs negotiate bulk drug pricing from major drug manufacturers, like Pfizer, and control prescription access to specific pharmacies within their network. 

PBMs have also, until very recently, been only covering namebrand medication, such as Qbrexza in my case, and not covering much cheaper generic medications, such as Drysol. 

However, this game continues because PBMs can disguise insurance coverage by offering what they term prescription DISCOUNT programs that charge the patient the full retail price, then offer a PBM discount on it. 
&gt;Say you need a 100$ prescription. You are on Walmart's insurance program, and have a 5$ copay for that. However, only 5$ is counted towards your deductible, rather than 100$, making it so that when you are more seriously injured you must pay a significant amount more to hit your deductible. This is one of the many ways you are gouged for healthcare.

In contrast, a traditional prescription INSURANCE program is where the insurance company will cover your medication, possibly charge a copay, and apply the full price of the drug to your deductible, because you paid the monthly premium to the insurance company. 

PBMs, Pharmacy Benefit Management companies, moving to monopolize Georgia's healthcare system by offering non-insurance options directly and cloaking their ""insurance"" options as traditional medical/prescription insurance, does not surprise me in the least. Hell, traditional pharmacy groups such as Pharmacy Group are supporting legislation in the Georgia legislature (SB 313, which enforces oversight by comparing GA PBM formulary pricing to federal drug pricing).

Copperheads also have a distinct and unique pattern in an hourglass shape. They look like dark saddlebags, with the two fat parts on either side and the narrow band across the back. 

The reply that they are darker brown and have diamond shaped bands is mistaken and probably thinking of diamondback snakes. 

Depending on shade of color, especially a common one like brown, for snakes isn't too reliable, since the color shade can vary a lot with most snakes. Depending on their environment, the time of year, and age of the snake the shade can be wildly different. Cottonmouths, for example can be banded brown with yellow or banded brown with reddish yellow, those bands could be vivid or faint, or they can be just all brown, or all black.",1583094851,fj7okuj

Never said they are working *for* Russia, but rather using Putin's disinformation and propaganda playbook. Which they are.

But now that you mention it, yes, it's pretty clear they work for Russia as well. They take more campaign donations from Russian oligarchs than from the American people. They do more business with Russia than for the American people. Trump stood on a world stage and publicly exclaimed that the US Intelligence Agencies were wrong and that he believes Putin.

There's really nothing special about that event. You're completely exaggerating what occurred, surprise surprise.

Russian “interference” was greatly overblown. It definitely had nothing to do with the GOP doing Russia's bidding.

Republicans are against the federal government involving itself in regulating private business and state matters, that's not news. 

&gt;Donald telling the world he trusts putin more than his own intelligence agencies in on fucking video for fucks sake.

You sound surprised that the guy who campaigned on being an outsider to Washington, who didn't trust everyone in Washington, who was mad his intelligence agencies “let Hillary go”, and who had people in his own intelligence agencies come out against him, didn't trust his intelligence agencies. It's not the greatest response, but it's not exactly that surprising given how he was.

And let's not forget kep held up registrations of 53,000 under the state’s “exact match” law where a misplaced hyphen or comma in a voter registration record.  Exact match proportionally hits democrats, minorities, etc much harder.   Funny how republicans consistently try to suppress the vote.....and you of course, don't give a shit.

And ""you"" people won't accept evidence ever...unless donald spews it out and tells you what to think.

You can't deny the kemp voter purges, the kemp wiped servers, kemp using exact match to suppress democrat votes.  All those are facts, you just want to deflect and deflect and do nothing.

I want to believe you, so the challenge is...

&gt;Many are in the process of doing discovery to see what it would take to serve their members.   
&gt;  
&gt;They only way it will happen is if the EMCs do it.

...and I don't think I've heard of any EMCs that are anywhere near close, have you?  Powerline and fiber technologies aren't new so I'd hope they'd figure it out really soon.

Telcoms are clearly playing on people's frustrations that neither them or EMCs have furthered their efforts.  Not many people outside of proper towns or cities seem to be served by the NGN fiber effort.

4661,thecannarella,"&gt; ...and I don't think I've heard of any EMCs that are anywhere near close, have you? Powerline and fiber technologies aren't new so I'd hope they'd figure it out really soon.  
&gt;  
&gt;Telcoms are clearly playing on people's frustrations that neither them or EMCs have furthered their efforts. Not many people outside of proper towns or cities seem to be served by the NGN fiber effort.

SB2 is only a year old and this is new territory for the EMCs. It will take time for them to decide if they want to get in the game, and if so start the necessary steps to move in that direction. It is about an 18-24 month startup process before first customer is turned on.

&gt; Do EMCs need to charge that much? How do they compare to non-EMCs in Georgia, like Georgia Power?  
&gt;  
&gt;I love my EMC and the co-op concept, don't get me wrong. I'm just trying to understand both sides.

They can't offer pole attachments for free but have negotiated rates that are agreed upon. I found some data where they say some EMCs charge as much as $22 per pole, but that isn't giving context. Is that a high density area where demand is high? The utility is ultimately responsible for the pole. From what I have heard typically the cost is below $10 per pole. The big thing is that on average there are 7-10 customers per mile in the rural areas. Poles are about 125' apart. So per mile you have 42 poles. Can a for profit broadband carrier make a profit on that? In the end the incumbents are getting put on notice.

As for the link, it was taken down because they got a tidal wave response where it was not needed anymore. I just got an email stating that.

I think the coop is out to serve it's members in anyway it can. They can't do it all but member satisfaction is their #1 goal.",1583529739,fjokrs1

4772,foulpudding,"Let’s look at sources I trust more than Facebook.
https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-and-the-new-hoax/

First paragraph: “There’s no question that the president described the disease as the Democrats’ “new hoax” at a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina.”

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/

from the what’s true section: 
“What's True
During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.”

Now, I’ll admit that Trump did publicly attempt to clarify that what he meant by hoax was That this is the Democrats new hoax, not that the virus is a hoax and that both of these sources state that. 

That said... Whatever was truly meant by The Democrats having a “hoax” about this requires some gymnastics, as the word hoax usually indicates something is false or fake, but whatever.

But there is this also this lady, a Trump supporter that shows anecdotally that at least some supporters heard the message from Trump that the virus itself is a hoax: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/trump-supporter-says-doesnt-believe-21626004.amp

Years ago my wife and I wanted a specific high-chair that was only sold at Kmart. The only one in a few hundred miles was the one on display at my local store. They didn't want to sell it as they had a ""no sale display"" policy. I finally got with the manager and we went back and forth till he admitted that he couldn't sell it because it was a baby item and was already assembled and he couldn't guarantee that it was assembled properly and that all of the pieces were there. Finally we settled that he would sell it to me (at a small discount surprisingly) if I would disassemble the entire thing in store so that I couldn't claim it was the stores fault if something wrong were to happen with the chair or my kid when I got it home.

The top rate fell from 39.6% to 37%, while the 33% bracket dropped to 32%, the 28% bracket to 24%, the 25% bracket to 22%, and the 15% bracket to 12%.10﻿ The lowest bracket remained at 10%, and the 35% bracket was also unchanged. The income bands that the new rates applied to are lower, compared to 2018 brackets under current law, for the five highest brackets.

For those of us w/ 5 figure state income tax bills + 5 figure property tax bills (or more), the marginal tax rate coming down a bit doesn't help when substantially more of our income are subject to taxes.  

My effective tax rate went up a bit from the cut b/c I have a lot of house and an ok amount of income w/o any kids for further deductions.  It hurts to look at but my lifestyle isn't at all impacted.  It's the upper middle class to lower millionaire class that's getting hit in exchange for the tax cuts for the hundred millionaire/billionaire class.  

Dropping the top bracket in the Trump cuts has the biggest impact b/c it covers the most income.  If you make let's say 2M/yr.  Roughly 3/4 of that income is covered at the top bracket so you would have an extra $40k in your pocket.  Go up to 20M, and 98% of your income is covered by the top bracket so that's a $500k tax break.

Georgia is trying to cut another 0.25% off the top rate.  If you have $100k of taxable income, this is $250/year.  That adds up to another $1,000 for every teacher in the state not to mention near double digit cuts in some services.  We hand the entertainment industry $1B/year so they film here.  Seems to me we could hand $350M/yr to teachers and they'd probably spend almost every dollar in the state.  

As per Trump's impact.  Real GDP isn't growing all that differently than before the tax cut except now we are running a massive trillion dollar/year deficit.  Typical families got an expected lifetime benefit of $21.7k.  The 1% got an expected lifetime benefit of $279k w/ those even wealthier collecting 7-8 figure tax benefits.  

Real median income actually slowed under Trump compared to Obama years after tanking under Bush.  Sure people have jobs but there are more people driving Uber than ever before.

1) Putting out far reaching PSAs explaining what the symptoms are. There’s an unbelievable amount of false information going around. Someone the other day told me a runny nose isn’t a symptom. If we want to stop the spread, we need people to know what the symptoms are and tell them to stay home if they’re exhibiting any. 

2) Get more tests available. The US really fucked up by refusing WHO kits. The first kits that were made here were faulty, and so the US is insanely far behind in testing. Realistically, everyone with symptoms should be seeing a doctor and being tested. They should stay at home until the results come in. 

3) seeing a doctor because of symptoms HAS to be free to everyone, as does any treatment following a positive result. If people think that they can’t afford the test or that they’ll be forced to pay for treatment/quarantine, they just won’t go to the doctor. 

4) a guarantee that you won’t be fired or have no income if you miss work. The only way to stop the spread is to make sure that anyone who could spread the virus stays away from everyone else. But again, if you think you’re going to lose your job from staying home, you’re not going to stay home even if you have symptoms. If you depend on every hour of work to get by, then you aren’t going to skip because of symptoms. 

Right now, there are no guarantees of these things. The government is telling us that there are plenty of tests available; that’s a lie. They’re telling us that face masks don’t help.

&gt; Cutting further makes us even further behind other states when we’re already a low tax state and top ten worst poverty rate.     

Low tax yes, but it’s specious to claim top ten in poverty when the relative position hovers between 10th and 12th in the nation, and it’s been trending slightly downward for the past 2-3 years, both in real and relative terms.     

&gt; I’d argue keeping us at 6% and focusing on elevating our citizens and labor force over bribing companies with hundreds of millions in corporate welfare is a more responsible use of our tax dollars.    

I’m not going to get into a debate over the rightness or wrongness of the tax breaks. The issue is that the GA has created an environment where they feel the need to lower taxes every session for no reason at all. Leaving the rate at 5.75% is fine.    

The issue with the teachers is the screwed up system for how schools are run and employees compensated in this state. If they want a state administered retirement plan that’s fine, but this mess of split compensation from the school boards and the state needs to end. Either the GA needs to fulfil their fantasy of taking over the schools or the counties need to learn to run the system on their own. I have no issues with grants and things of that nature, but the governance of the public school system in this state is a mess.

4983,mkhnghn,"What do you mean the steady low rate validates the numbers in China? A death rate of 3.5% is not low at all. It’s lower than Ebola, SARS and MERS but those were all far less contagious and effected far fewer people. The link you sent supports the idea that this is a very serious thing and will be more impactful that those other viruses listed.

If the death rate of 3.5 remains, that’s a significant negative, not a positive. Countries that are being overwhelmed at the moment (Italy) are sitting at a death rate of 6% and that’s using the active cases as a denominator and not factoring that many of the active cases will likely die.

I believe the death rate in Wuhan is 5% or so, and the slowing of the spread happened only after DRASTIC measures were taken by the Chinese government and the people of the region. Implying that the numbers are naturally falling or leveling off is not supported by any actual evidence out there. The virus is being controlled effectively due to considerable human actions aimed at doing so, and they are actions that the US is very unlikely to take to a similar degree.

5150,tavisk,"Well..  firstly, there is not a single primary document for the bible.  All of the ""books"" of the bible were oral stories that were not written down until decades after the supposed times of the events yet are full of direct quotes.  When's the last time you were able to quote accurately hundreds of pages of dialog that happened in the 1970's much less the 1800's ?  None of the books of the bible are written by anyone who was there.  I know there are Paul's and John's and what have you but none of those are the actual apostles writing things down.  Those are some guy named John that lived 50 years after the event talking about how he thinks the church should be run and retelling stories someone else told him.

Secondly, the series of books you call the bible wasn't established until 300-500 years after the death of Christ.  This was largely done because the roman empire wanted to leverage the growing popularity of Christianity to keep power in the region.  The roman empire literally became the roman catholic church over time.

Thirdly,  there are a large number of historically inaccurate events in the bible that are not recorded by everyone else including the romans who kept extensive documentation.  For instance there was no historical census at the time of Jesus's birth and if there was there would be no reason to return to the home of your ancestors to take part in it.  And again let's be clear there was no guy named ""Jesus"", if you called him that he would have looked at you confused because his name was ""Yeshua"" of which the modern equivalent would be ""Joshua"".  Also while the bible lists a number of crazy events and miracles none of them are mentioned in any other documentation no matter how widespread they may have been.  When Paul says all of the graves opened up and the dead wandered the streets upon the death of Jesus, either that was too boring to record or noone else witnessed it.

Lastly,  if your going to accept the claims of the bible then you're gonna have to go ahead and accept the claims of the literally hundreds of other religions with their own holy books and fervent believers who sound just like you.  They have the same evidence you do.

If there is one truth to be learned from this it should be that humans love to tell stories and if those stores can be used to gain power and influence over others there will definitely be people to do that too.

When we look at historical facts it is important to realize that for the most part we can't say anything is truly factual because literally everything that has ever been written is written with a bias.  We need to be ok with ""i don't know"" in places where we don't have answers.

TLDR: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and the bible does not meet that burden.",1584054542,fkcjpr7

&gt; Facebook and Twitter revealed evidence Thursday suggesting that Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election are getting more sophisticated and harder to detect.

&gt; The companies said they have removed dozens of fake accounts and pages from their services.

&gt; ...

&gt; The accounts Facebook took down focused on stoking racial divisions. Some posed as legitimate non-governmental organizations in order to deceive people.

&gt; The takedowns follow a report last week that found **Moscow’s campaign of election interference hasn’t let up since 2016, and in fact has gotten more difficult to detect.**

&gt; That report, from University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Young Mie Kim, found that **Russia-linked social media accounts are posting about the same divisive issues — race relations, gun laws and immigration — as they did in 2016, when the Kremlin polluted American voters’ feeds with messages about the presidential election.** Facebook has since removed those accounts as well.",1584110036,fkec45h

I've heard mixed things about kids being carriers vs recovering fully. I think we're just more likely to cuddle and kiss a kid over another adult and kids wash their hands less; so the normal germ machines are running just the germs have been hitting the gym.

I've also read a couple reports that males who have survived are showing damage in their testicular tissues. They don't know what that could mean for fertility, if anything. But I can't decide if that's propaganda or not either. 

So I'm mildly concerned going forward 15-20 years if we're going to have a generation of infertile/low fertility males. This virus is definitely going to reshape us in a lot of tiny ways. I hope it's big impact is not as big as the CDC has been warning since everybody really understood the 1918 pandemic.

Braselton, GA hosts the Petit Le Mans car race every year with \~120,000 attendees. *(source: my memory. Might be lower now.)*

Athens, GA hosts \~7 SEC football games per year with \~90,000 attendees. *(*[*source*](https://www.ajc.com/sports/leadoff-uga-bucks-trend-college-football-attendance-declines/OZwQzZLeotU9QzN92bd1II/)*)*

Yankee Stadium, Dodgers Stadium, Yankee Field and other parks seem to average around 40,000 attendees per game.

That's across 81 home games per year. *(*[*source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures)*)*

Queens, NY has been hosting the US Open since 1978 which, according to [this site](https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2019-09-08/photos_trevor_noah_michael_douglas_among_celebs_at_mens_us_open_final.html);

They are the assholes who have to try to analogize what a cell phone is to what the Founders would have in front of them because the “Constitution is **dead**.” (Stated in the fearful, angry cadence of Scalia). 

I am focused on 1953, because that was a magical year for conservatives in this nation, as Eisenhower was president, and separate but equal was still the law. If the Roberts Court’s attacks on the Voting Rights Act and other laws that ensure access and equity in society (with many of those challenges being concocted by the Federalist Society and associated think tanks) is anything to say, the basic purpose of the Federalist Society is to push America to the right. The society has fascist characteristics. As Umberto Eco posited about the characteristics of fascism:

* The Federalist Society is a “cult of tradition” (“but in fact seek to ENSURE THE VALUES OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE UPHELD.” Your words, not mine)

* The “rejection of modernism.” Pretty self-explanatory

* The cult of action for action’s sake. Say... initiating law suits to prove their point? DC v. Heller; Citizens United

* Fear of difference/contempt for the weak. 

* Selective populism. Bread and butter legal issues of the populists, w/o any regard to their consequence or actual historical background (Gun rights; you have to be in a militia, like the militia that Washington called up during the Whiskey Rebellion).

* Newspeak. To me this really comes out in the “I used language in a dissent; and NOW that I’m in the majority, I can use that language to JUSTIFY my position now that we’re in the MAJORITY!” It’s bullshit. That’s not how stare decisis works.

Also idk how you find his tweets “crude, crass, and vulgar”. It is however very childish and he shouldn’t be tweeting national policy. 

Point is, disagreeing with someone politically and then saying “if this man gets sick, and this other man dosnt get sick, there is no god” is taking on the exact same level of childishness that trump does on twitter

That would be a lie.  There is plenty of evidence to justify the bigotry label, for example the DOJ suing donalds organization twice for not renting to black people.  Which he caved on and paid the penalties.  Tip of the iceberg, there are many more examples. 

&gt; Not lazy

Donald has spent one third of his days fucking golfing.  At his own facilities of course so can make money of the visits...approximately 100 million so far.  So bonus....lazy and grifting. 

Speaking of grifting...you do know he had to shut down his fake university where he was defrauding working class people and pay a $25 million dollar fine....right?

You do realize he had to shut down his fake charity and pay millions in fines for his ....fake charity.  Right. 

&gt;  Also wanting to build a wall is not racist 

You mean his wall that ""mexico will pay for"".   You fell for his lying bullshit right?   The wall the wind blew over, and teenagers cut through with hack saws, and demonstrated how easy it is to climb over.   That wall? 
And yes it is racist when donald intentionally inflames racial tensions ""druggies and rapists"" and ""it's an invasion"" with fox news screaming ""immigrants are dirtying america"".  But clearly you are cool with all that racism, bigotry and hate.  Good to know that about you.

&gt; so it might be true but it probably isnt.

Left out donald literally on tape ""grab some pussy"".  Left out donald paying women to spank his old fat flabby ass.  Left out it's actually 20+ women.  But please continue with ""fuck women who report sexual assault"".

Spending a third of his days at a resort and playing golf means he is by definition not working.  You can try and deflect all you want.  His spending a $130 million of tax payer dollars (at his resorts) is nothing more than lining his own pockets for personal gain....while playing golf.

&gt; so the “trump fat” thing is if someone insults others you are allowed to insult them

Pointing out when a person is being wildly hypocrital is fair game.  Donald glories in calling women ugly while being clinically obese.  Fair game to call him fat assed....especially because it is accurate and true.

&gt; Also what is this about trump and adultery 

You.....do know he has 5 kids by 3 wives and gloried in adultery with all of them.....right?   Especially the last trophy wive.  You know, the one that did the lesbian porn shoots.  

&gt; him hiring people to “spank his ass”?

Oh please You can't possible have missed him paying stormy daniels, while his current wife was home with their newborn, to spank his old fat flabby ass, you know - another act of donald committing adultery.

Either way all family members should Isolate also. It will mostly like pass with few problems but you and family should not be out of isolation.

He said if you have real difficulty breathing or other severe symptoms call the hospital before going to the emergency room. 

&gt;From the local news I learned if you need to go to the hospital, go alone if possible,  if a person is driving you they will not be allowed inside the hospital.)

My doctor also said he was canceling all normal refill appointments, and would give refills as needed over the phone. 

Even if not sick with flu or Covid symptoms , if you currently have an appointment do not come into the office before calling to discuss as the doctor may be able to talk to you by phone or facetime so you can reduce risk of social interaction.

I'm posting this here specifically because this sub has included other avenues of financial aid.

(Also applicable to Florida which uses the same system, except their governor didn't remove it from the website like Kemp recently did. 🤬)

**THIS ENTIRE GUIDE IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. EVERYTHING HERE GOES BY GEORGIA LAW AND IS IN NO MEANS TRYING TO SKIRT AROUND ANY REQUIREMENTS. DO NOT COMMIT FRAUD. This system can just be very confusing to people who do not have as much experience with it as I do.**

One of the biggest misconceptions is that you need to be dirt poor to receive food stamps. Obviously, the worse your situation, the more you will likely get. Nevertheless, if you are struggling and able to get ANYTHING -- even the $20-50 minimum -- this will obviously help you. Between 2004-2010 when I was still a minor, my mom and I received $250-280 in Florida, as she was a severely disabled (massive stroke) single mother who still cannot physically or mentally work. My roommate who works as a sub and entertainer with very little consistent income received $190.

Never leave eligible free money on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

# Where do I start?

[Here is where you can download and print the forms.](https://dfcs.georgia.gov/food-stamps) I would recommend faxing or mailing via certified mail so you can have a receipt of delivery. **YOU CANNOT SEND IN THIS INFORMATION OVER THE WEBSITE DESPITE MISLEADING VERBIAGE THAT THIS OPTION IS STILL AVAILABLE. (Blame Kemp.)**

Submit your PAPER application to [your local county office](https://dfcs.georgia.gov/locations) via fax, mail, or in-person. Other counties can take your application, but I do not recommend this. I recommend using fax or certified mail.

# Who qualifies?

The guidelines for who qualifies are truly an enigma, even for someone like me who has been doing this for my family members for over 15 years. I say if you make under $40k, it's definitely worth a shot. If you make under $50k, it's still worth a shot, but you're probably less likely to get anything or you may just get the bare minimum. If you have kids or dependents, it typically increases your likelihood of not only getting food stamps but getting more than a single person.

# IMPORTANT: IF YOU HAVE ROOMMATES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO APPLY...

IF YOU HAVE ROOMMATES WITH WHOM YOU DO NOT PRIMARILY SHARE MEALS NOR PAY FOR EACH OTHERS' MEALS: **DO. NOT. LIST. THEM. UNDER. HOUSEHOLD. INCOME.**

The legal definition for 'household' is someone who SHARES AND PAYS FOR MEALS WITH YOU. So, partners, children, parents (usually) count under household but ROOMMATES DO NOT.

Every roommate should apply separately.

Sorry for all the caps, but many people have trouble understanding this point.

# What to expect after you apply:

1. You will receive a call from someone asking if you are available. They will probably be short and to the point since they cannot reveal why they are calling until you confirm. They are also working with tons of cases so please be patient with them.
2. They will ask about information you already provided. Just roll with it, and help them with anything they need clarification on.
3. They will likely ask for you to submit proof of income (or lack thereof). Paystubs for regular W2 workers and usually bank statements for freelance workers. If you have roommates who share bills with you, they may ask for copies of your lease and/or bills. — When I applied, my rep gave me a fax number to send these documents to. **UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE STATE BENEFITS, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT ONLINE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR CASE.** If the rep implies otherwise, just push that the website doesn’t work. (My roommate dealt with this and even when she tried signing up on the website, it legitimately didn't work and kept rejecting our address.) They will either give you a direct fax or direct email. This seems to vary county by county, which is unfortunate.
4. After you get these documents in, you may still receive some delayed and confusing letters via mail about needing an appointment or to send stuff you’ve already sent in. Just blame the government and slow mail.
5. If you stop being able to get in contact with your rep and it’s been over a week since you submitted your additional documentation IN FULL, you can check your status via phone at (877) 423-4746. If you are approved, it will tell you how much for the next two months and for how long you will receive benefits. Most starting periods last 6 months with the first month being slightly lower than the rest.
6. You will receive an approval or rejection letter. I have never been rejected on unfair grounds so I cannot 100% help with the appeal process, but I have experience with insurance appeals, so I can try my best if you let me know what’s up.
7. Soon after this letter, you will receive a generic looking letter from another state (where the card is made). 

Open, activate, and use. The website on the back of the card appears to be broken so make sure to call and use the automated system before you’re at the cashier line and can barely hear the audio. (Don't make the same mistake I did at Publix. 🤦🏻‍♀️)",1584404448,fkp8vu2

  Of the 22 freshman representatives who are nonwhite, just one is a Republican (Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who is Hispanic). 

 In the full 116th Congress, the overwhelming majority of racial and ethnic nonwhite members are Democrats (90%), while just 10% are Republicans. 

 Over a third of incoming House Democrats identify as people of color, though just 2 percent of incoming House Republicans do. 

 In the House, 89 women are Democrats, and 13 are Republicans. 

 The 116th Congress includes the first two Muslim women ever to serve: Democrats Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

Glad we all agree on that.  Putin was very successful in getting donald in office.  And it is working out spectacularly for russia.

That's what those states want.  They voted for billionaire tax breaks and said fuck you to education, infrastructure and the environment.  Actions have consequences. 

&gt; I was sure hoping President Obama had a successful economy while he was President. 

And he did.  He took the republican depression of 2008 and turned it around into a robust economy which he turned over to donald.  Then donald and republicans instead of investing in the US said fuck it, tax break for billionaires.

Trump disbanded the governmental Pandemic oversight division because he ""wanted to save money.""

Trump resisted initial containment measures because it would harm his reelection chances. 

Trump called it a hoax. 

Trump said that the few cases we had would quickly disappear.

Trump allowed the first Corona virus victims to fly back to the US on a plane full of non-sick people. 

Trump's allies and supporters were denying the severity of the virus, and encouraging people to go out into public.

**Trump turned down WHO testing kits at the time it could have made all the difference.** 

Trump has purposefully limited testing because the statistics would make him look bad. 

Trump went on national TV and said that the testing procedures were unpleasant, likely discouraging his supporters to get tested if they do show symptoms.

SO this is one example but I found a few others while looking. The original SARS took 20 months to make it testable in humans. The vaccine creator at the time, who they said had the highest capability to create vaccines, could only make 100million a year. That said,

5903,VigilantRESOLVE,"Look I get it you want to tax the rich and redistribute the wealth. Well I don't. But universal healthcare doesn't magically create more hospitals, medical supplies and doctors. Will welfare programs be sustainable when no one is working, meaning no one is paying taxes to fund those liabilities. 

Just becuase you test positive for COVID doesn't mean you will get any treatment, in the US or any other nation. Unless you need assistance breathing, they will send you home.

What would these social programs do for the 16 million, myself included, that are self-employed? Germany? You have to wait 7 weeks to get sick leave if self-employed. The UK? No unemployment benefits. And guess what, we still pay taxes, and my social security and medicare taxes are 15%. If you are a W-2 employee is only 7.5%. Your employer picks up the tab on the other 7.5%, plus the pay for your unemployment insurance. If every person could put 15% of their pay into an investment account of their own instead of social security, they'd retire with much more than social security pays out. Go ahead and tax me out of business.

This isn't some big business/rich people being mad about taxes. We are ordinary people. 

Universal Healthcare won't create better care, better cancer survival rates, etc. You can have 3 choices fast, cheap, or high quality. Now pick two. Check out the VA hospitals if you'd like. The only thing the government runs decently is the post office, and 3 days a week my mail is in my neighbors box or I have theirs.

If you want socialized medicine you don't just raise taxes on me you raise taxes on the guy making 20k a year working at mcdonalds as well as the middle class. The middle class will pay more than their taxes+premiums now in just taxes. I don't think marginal tax rates that go up to 70% and a family making 80k a year should be in a 50+% tax bracket. That's not good for anyone. Any social program you want to add to the US right now will be put on the backs of middle class people. You could tax the top 10% of Americans at 100% and it wouldn't cover the costs. I'm all for helping my fellow citizens, but it isn't working in Europe. Their unemployment was double ours through the EU as a whole, places like Italy and Spain were much higher than that. Norway has a massive national investment arm from national oil profits to use. Switzerland, has much less red tape for business, same with a couple other nordic countries. Also not to mention we literally provide security for them for pennies on the dollar.",1584643699,fky8frd

5905,killroy200,"&gt; But universal healthcare doesn't magically create more hospitals, medical supplies and doctors. Will welfare programs be sustainable when no one is working, meaning no one is paying taxes to fund those liabilities.

If people aren't forced to continue working even though they suspect they may be sick, it reduces total potential for spread of disease, which, yes, makes healthcare systems more sustainable in the long run. Extreme events may overwhelm such systems, but total scope of the crisis is reduced as the first patients are able to get initial care without worry of cost. If your population is unable to even go to the doctor, or even just stop working when sick, they end up spreading illness further, to more people.

&gt; What would these social programs do for the 16 million, myself included, that are self-employed?

First, it means you'll at least have access to medical care with or without the paid leave, regardless of your current income, or employment status. Second, our system doesn't have to precisely follow other nations', and could use a modified form of social security as a short-term unemployment insurance system, with longer-term health-related benefits. Third, you, as your own company, *really should* be setting aside money for paid time off, whether that's for vacation or sick leave; many companies don't bother distinguishing a difference.

&gt; This isn't some big business/rich people being mad about taxes. We are ordinary people.

Great. Then you should pay in like ordinary people, and get benefits due. Granted, *ordinary* people aren't self-employed. Just saying.

&gt; If you want socialized medicine you don't just raise taxes on me you raise taxes on the guy making 20k a year working at mcdonalds as well as the middle class. The middle class will pay more than their taxes+premiums now in just taxes.

Only if you design the tax system that way, but you don't have to. At all. Hell, just increasing funding to the IRS would rake in hundreds of billions alone in a closed tax-gap without doing any change to people's tax rates. A combination of adjusting the upper brackets with, yes, higher marginal rates (the U.S. used to have a highest rate of 92% in the 60s), combined with tighter control of corporate tax loopholes, and even better capital gains taxes would be able to do plenty of the rest of the work.

“Beach said: “Here are the facts: on Saturday, March 14th, I was cleared by my doctor to resume my official duties and presented with no reason to believe I had COVID-19 or any other serious illness. I followed the advice of my doctor that did not include actions such as quarantine related to the treatment of COVID-19. It is disappointing that some have chosen to misrepresent and manipulate the facts regarding private conversations I had with my doctor. It is outrageous and cowardly to allege that I would intentionally put my colleagues, friends, staff, and family at risk of contracting this virus.”

He continued: “In a time of crisis, some choose to make false accusations and spread untruths. But it is wrong and harmful to make assumptions about an individual’s health or medical conditions before knowing all the facts.”.

Beach reported that he went to a doctor on Saturday for complications from a preexisting condition he regularly suffers from. Beach was prescribed a standard course of antibiotics which is not a treatment for COVID-19, and he was cleared to continue the duties of his office. Beach was then surprised to learn on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus and immediately took all necessary precautions, informing everyone he had been in contact with. Senator Beach is now at home and will undergo a self-quarantine. “

Interesting little history lesson about this word from [McGill University: ](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/history-quackery/history-hysteria) 

“Hysteria was basically the medical explanation for ‘everything that men found mysterious or unmanageable in women’, a conclusion only supported by men’s (historic and continuing) dominance over medicine, and hysteria’s continued use as a synonym for “over-emotional” or “deranged.” It’s also worth noting how many of the problems physicians were attempting to fix in female patients, were not problems when they presented in male patients. Gendered stereotypes, like the ideas that women should be submissive, even-tempered, and sexually inhibited, have caused tremendous damage throughout history (and continue to do so today). It doesn’t seem so coincidental then that most modern treatments for hysteria involved regular (marital) sex, marriage or pregnancy and childbirth, all ‘proper’ activities for a ‘proper’ woman.”",1584831788,fl59ujp

To add further, Trump, aside from being an overreach of powers, would not shut down the entire nation because many parts of the Midwest are not at anywhere near a level that would require that. Secondly how would you manage something like that? The NG and military in general is stretched pretty thin right now as it is. Not to mention, you want to cause a panic and skyrocket mass hysteria, send armed military into cities and enforce lock downs and curfews. That's how you induce panic and fear.

Much in the same way, in rural parts of Georgia you can go 500 square miles and not find 5000 people, but in Atlanta in 1 square mile there are likely over 5,000 people to suggest we should shut down the state and treat them both equally is absurd. We can argue about whether he is a good leader or not, but how he's handling this situation is really the way he should be handling it.

Local mayors, much like Bottoms has, such make decisions around what is best for their individual communities. Kemp as Governor should be working with the Federal Government to make sure that Georgia is getting their fair share of whatever Federal dollars that would be given to the states for support. When those communities have a massive increase in cases, there's nowhere else you should be pointing except your local leaders.

There is also the huge increase in vaping by individuals under 40 years old to thank for the additional risk of an uncontrolled outbreak. Again the Republican party has backed big tobaccos newest addicting formulation with nicotine.

The 4% figure becomes much more likely if we relax the social distancing regulations too early. 
Or if too many healthcare workers get sick with the Coronavirus and remain undetected because there are not enough tests to check people at risk who are asymptomatic.

Then there is the wonderful fact that our country just spent 2.25 Trillion Dollars because some one who shall not be named decided that 28 million dollars was too much to spend on infectious disease research on “shithole” countries. 

Ever wonder how someone could go through bankruptcy 3 times and get elected President?
Well now you know why tax returns need to be released by every candidate for the office of the President. 

So about that 28 million dollars that was cut from our foreign aid budget for investigating and researching infectious diseases(specifically corona virus research). Assuming we ignore Wall Streets loses, all the state budget losses, all individuals lost earnings, all business losses and the international financial markets losses then we can say that $28 million dollars in savings only cost us 80,000 times as much in federal budget expenses(so far!!). It takes a real special genius to come up with a budget cut that could even cause 1/100th of the damage that this one did. 

So after that monumentally stupid result you have the gall to call a health professional’s estimate of death rate which is well within known results in multiple counties around the world (China, Italy, Spain, and Iran) ....”preposterous”.

7389,ScienceReliance,"The numbers lie if you take them at face value, let me help explain it may be long but I don't want to leave anything out. Your data is based on those who have died so far compared to all confirmed infected, even those infected today when it can take weeks or even months to succumb, along with a lot of other factors. But remember more people have died of it than recovered in the US so far. 

jan 19th is when the first cases hit the US, he had had symptoms for 4 days and was likely contagious any time between the 15th and 2nd of jan. It is now almost 3 month in and those numbers swelled to 85k. With the rate of infection which is explosive, the pace of symptoms showing which is 4-14 days even for those vulnerable, as the virus has to build up a viral load after entering the system even a vulnerable one. Although much lower levels than ones that present symptoms are needed to infect others. With that and the lack of medical resources those numbers are much more frightening. I'll break it down.

For example of georgias 1500 cases, over 400 are hospitalized now ~30%. The average hospitalization for someone who needs medical attention due to the virus (those 400 out of 1500) is 2 weeks to 2 months, so those 400 beds will not be open for a while, without medical attention a majority of them will die (as hospitals are flat out turning away anyone who isn't high risk or presenting life threatening symptoms even now). In 25 days georgia we went from 1 to 1500 cases, it spreads exponentially, one person going out in public or to a market can spread it to dozens more. it survives in the air for 3 hours, 3 days on metal and plastic (doors, handles, counters, containers) and 1 day on paper. Many people do not present symptoms. IE ""healthy"" people running errands for elderly family members, ignoring the order all together or just -have- to go get some glitter to do crafts with their kids because they need an excuse, any excuse to get out of the house are making others sick. 

The virus seems fairly random while it does hit the elderly and vulnerable harder, 10% of the young (18-40 year olds) need to be hospitalized to survive it, they have a great success rate (only 1 in 100 or 1 in 50 dying from it ie 1-2%) but without medical attention that 10% will have a 5-8% death rate. While all presenting with symptoms will have severe lifelong lung damage after, regaurdless of severity, although severity will make the damage worse.

The us has in total 300,000 open hospital beds at any one time among 327 Million people (3 million beds overall but 2.7 million those are taken by emergencies and those ill and injured from other issues at BEST the lack of going out and doing things or working may possibly drop it to 2.5 million filled beds, or 500k beds open at any one time. HOWEVER, the home is just as dangerous and bored people do stupid things and drink away their time.

Basically if drastic actions are not taken the rapid spread will sweep across every community, it's already in every community in less than 3 months, imagine the spread with so many infected already? Forcing 10% of the 18-40 range into hospitals as well as 40-60% of those over 60. And our hospitals can't even handle 10% of the 18-40 demographic being sick for 2 weeks to 2 months let alone the higher risk demographics. Coupled with the US having the highest rate of at-risk health issues, our death rate is most certainly going to be vastly higher than most other countries. Even Italy due to lack of beds, ventilators and doctors, millions could quite literally, slowly drown to death from pneumonia, or in their own blood from coughing so hard they rupture something with no one to help them. The virus also doesn't ONLY attack the lungs, it spreads to the liver, hearth, kidneys, and bloodstream in general. 



It seems all well and good now but this is the onset, the very beginning, we are not IN the pandemic we are seeing the first sneeze of the virus when it won't really show it's horrors for 1-3 months when a higher percentage of the population is infected. 

Hospitals are already out of masks and supplies, I spoke to someone in my town with only 18 confirmed cases, and they have supplies under lock and aren't giving them out to nurses or patients. They (us hospitals not my local ones) are already running out of ventilators which again are needed for 2 weeks to 2 months. Young healthy nurses are dying due to the high viral load they are receiving while treating patients. 

Remember, only .0242% of the population has caught the virus at this point. and even georgia hospitals are showing signs of strain with 400 patients. 

What happens when it's 4-6 thousand? 10? 30k? what happens when the 25-50% of the us population needs medical attention in the next few months rather than 1/4th of 1% we have right now?

The high survival rate in other countries is due to total lockdowns and with rapid and ongoing medical treatment, the US has fewer medical resources to go around than any country it has hit, and we are now the worst hit of any country on earth. 

Japan is a cluster of massive expansive cities in a small area, but everyone took it seriously because they believe in community and the greater good, they shut it down fast and hard. EVERYONE acted to lower the chances of infection and they have almost 3 times the medical resources for their population than we do, they were in a better position and no one was making light of it they've had 1100 cases so far in the country, when a vast majority of their population live in close contact cities, each of which had the population of or twice the population of new york (nyc has 23000 cases), and they had it before us. 1/3rd were from a cruise (which circulates air among cabin rooms) and they're concerned over 47 new cases in one day when the US had 6000 today.

It makes me feel better to think of the 1.5-6% numbers of the rest of the world. Unfortunately we are not handling it like the rest of the world. We are handling it far worse than Italy, which had a 6% death rate. 

We are doing little to nothing while people lick deodorant, cough on fruit and our government (which we all chose and allowed to be elected) is squabbling over how many millions of us it's -ok- to let die to save shareholders their assets.",1585292631,flmqmah
7390,rethinkingat59,"You screw up your entire case up by never accounting for the fact the US only tested the very sick within certain parameters. 

You can’t make assumptions about outcome by rate of people that are confirmed having the disease when we still don’t test suspected cases unless hospitalization is likely to be needed.

7395,ScienceReliance,"I did account for it by pulling from countries that did do widespread testing and accounted for the basic spread rate over time before the US decided to take action, I then took the conservative estimate from that to use in the 25-35% of overall people needing at least 1 substantial visit to a hospital (emergency room visit's take several hours and many man hours behind the scenes even for a simple prognosis, clogging hospitals and doctors time) up to long term medical attention assuming a majority of the population is infected in the next 3-7 months which we are ramping up for faster than anyone is acting to prevent. 

Accounting for rates of major diseases like cancer, liver or heart disease, smoking (including weed) vaping, asthma, those with immune diseases, obesity (which affects 39.8% of Americans alone) Organ donors and recipients, anyone on dialysis and some other bits and bobs. Also accounting for those who don't present with any symptoms and lobbed off a large percentage for people who are in multiple categories.  

I also accounted for the population based on age, I didn't add in the 10% of healthy 18-40 year olds into the final estimate though for a more sure number, i also cut out anyone bellow age 18 entirely. All of that why my estimation is such a wide margin, however if the 25-35% is going to change based on the data I omitted it will only go up.

To make my point going into the finer details of who is and isn't tested and why and spending the time to get more precise numbers is not very useful, not many people will read what I wrote let alone another 4 pages, this isn't a college thesis. This just an overview hitting on larger points with a lot of background math, and making it any longer seems a little unnecessary. I was putting it in layman's terms because my target readers are not people in relevant fields, those people are already arguing for a shutdown. 

I certainly didn't account for every variable but I enjoy research and as my main field is biology and animal conservation (ecology) The same maths are used as the ones used to estimate populations, disease spread etc. It's just different variables.I didn't want to be too bleak. Of course not all of them will die. But it does paint a very grim picture for sending all the groups I mentioned above home to hope so they can focus on the ones they know they can save (like Italy had to do). 


Another silver lining is if we haven't entirely pissed off the rest of the world yet we may get emergency aid to help us through the worst of it, another factor i did not account for. My numbers are based on the topic at hand, the lack of action in flattening the curve and a rough but conservative estimate of it's inevitable snowball effect so people can in general understand the issue from the perspective of a doctor or epidemiologists without getting bogged down in minutiae like the breaking point of doctors in a few months when they're physically incapable of working and their numbers are cut by dying from exposure to the disease at such high levels with questionable PPE.


My number isn't based on who will die, it's based on who will need medical attention to live in the nation as a whole, and how few resources we have to ensure they do. But yes, a large number of those people will die when the first 300k beds fill up. A small lucky percentage with medically significant symptoms will survive on their own, just like the few who came out of the various plagues in history. and plenty won't know they have it. But we can't discount those who won't be that lucky not when we have a high rate of health issues in this state and upwards of 700,000 people over 65",1585299472,flmwdp7

But as someone who has close friends living in southern California (where everyone has been ordered to shelter in place), a shelter in place order isn’t really a real shut down because there’s not any enforcement. People are still going to the store, the coffee shop, gas stations, congregating on the beaches, etc. Life there isn’t really any different than life for the average person in metro Atlanta, shut down or no shut down. 

As of the latest report, there are still 57 counties in this state who have yet to report a single case of COVID-19. Do I think people in those rural counties should be taking precautions like the rest of us? Absolutely. But do I also understand Kemp’s rationale for not wanting to shut down all of Georgia when over 1/3rd of Georgia’s counties are entirely unaffected? I certainly do.

Screenings are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at no cost and no appointment required. You log into the app from home. Screenings are done by a provider who is a physician, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant and trained to screen for COVID-19.  Please note:  A positive screening does not mean you have COVID-19.

 

Patients who screen positive will be told about appropriate next steps, which could include visiting a testing site.  Patients who screen negative are provided their visit summary and will be given guidance on next steps for treatment of their symptoms.

  

AU cannot guarantee perfect screening results, but are confident their medical professionals are using the most up-to-date and latest COVID-19 screening practices.

There's a reason experts keep saying ""flatten the curve"" not ""stop the virus"". The goal should be to slow it down to a pace that is more manageable, both medically and economically.

Look at how China and South Korea are so concerned about secondary epidemic breakouts. They both clamped down (in much different ways) to stop the spread; but the second you start relaxing, the virus starts getting a foothold again. The US should have taken this serious much sooner, provided support for high-risk individuals (elderly, immuno-compromised, etc) to isolate, and taken an aggressive position on being health conscious. Quarantining may now be necessary in places at this point; but we can't be naive about the ramifications.

The difference between you and I is that I think the economic and market impact of hundreds of thousands or potentially millions of taxpayers, employers, and employees dying while this thing runs its course (nationally, rather than in Georgia specifically) over the coming months will be worse than the economic and market impact of shutting down temporarily and trying to keep the market afloat with economic stimulus while we “flatten the curve.”  You clearly believe the opposite.

And to some degree, if you just don’t think coronavirus will be that bad—if you believe the president that it’ll sort itself out in a couple weeks, rather than believing the epidemiologists and experts who have been screaming from the rooftops that we need to take this seriously—I can see why you’d believe a few people getting sick now is worth it.  

My wife is in healthcare, and it’s really impossible to overemphasize how scared providers are of this thing. So maybe I’m biased.  But we’ve experienced major crashes, and near-complete market failures before, and dug ourselves back out through, believe it or not, intelligent and forward-thinking policy at the federal level.  What we can’t bring back is people who die because overcrowded and underequipped hospitals have to start making decisions to let otherwise-saveable people die, which is exactly what’s happening in Italy right now.  

And let’s be real: there are people dying of starvation and underemployment *already* in this country, and I don’t see conservatives voting to strip social safety net benefits concerned about keeping them alive now.  Why’s it gonna be different two years (or ten) into a market crash?  Because now you’re afraid it might be you, rather than a poor stranger you’ve never met?

However, I also have no doubt whatsoever that letting coronavirus kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people will also cause a crash, as well as permanently removing those people (who will not all be old and elderly) from the workforce and tax base.  Both are just a question of severity.

We have been overdue for a major market correction for years.  This shouldn’t be controversial.  Billion dollar companies have been artificially inflating their stock price by using the last decade of tax cuts on stock buybacks rather than investment and emergency planning (which, incidentally, is regular folks *are* expected to do).  I don’t think any serious economist doubts that a major correction was on the way even before this happened.

So, assuming we have a crash either way, what then?  We have crashed before.  I assume you’re familiar with the new deal.  We had a major recession in the 70s, and another just as I was entering the workforce a decade and change ago.  Recessions are salvageable, crashes are salvageable, and full-on depressions are salvageable.  We live in, as far as I’m aware, the richest country in the history of mankind.  The money to get through another crash or depression is here, it’s just a question of allocation and planning by the people in charge.  The federal government can afford an expansion of unemployment and social safety net benefits to keep people fed during a crash.  Fiscal conservatives may *prefer* that money being spent on bombs and F-35s and tax cuts for billion dollar companies. But it exists.

I’m not a kemp supporter before you downvote. 

Listening to GPB today, they had the speaker of the house on and a few local leaders. Most of the local leaders were hesitant to shut down given that it would cause mass unemployment and there was no federal or statewide safety net established yet. Once the stimulus bill passes, including provisions to increase unemployment benefits, and people receive those checks, local leaders will have no issue shutting down their cities and counties. 

It could be argued that the virus doesn’t adhere to county line borders and so a statewide shutdown should be implemented, but it’s going to cost people their livelihood in the process and currently there is no good mechanism to make those people while financially.

7711,sleelol,"I went to Dawson Forest about a month ago in February at around 1800 with my friend. At this point, it was already very dark. We wanted to explore the South Gate and parked at the main parking. Now we were well aware of all the sketchy things that transpire at Dawson Forest, especially at the South Gate. Anyways, we equipped our gear, walked past the hot cell building, and continued down Blue Trail until it reached Reservoir Road. Upon reaching Reservoir Road, we continued to walk down it until we found a small, narrow trail leading into dense, young pine trees on the left. (I've marked the trail on the map provided.) Everything up to this point went well; we were enjoying our time hiking and chattering, while at the same time being cautious about our surroundings. I'm pretty sure the trail is an ATV trail because of the tracks we saw freshly imprinted in the mud, and it is way too narrow to fit a jeep or truck. Before entering the trail, we both looked at each other and felt a sense of dread. The entrance to this particular trail did look quite eerie.  Unfortunately, we both ignored our instinct and advanced. Looking back, we really, really should've listened to our instincts and should've just continued hiking Reservoir Road. Anyways, after about thirty minutes of walking down this creepy trail, we decided to stop and make a campfire.

After making the fire, (which took forever because everything was wet and half-frozen) we rested there for a while, I'd say about an hour. Then, I just so happened to turn around and see lights approaching in the distance. I told my friend we should go, and we quickly put out the fire and luckily collected all of our gear fast. At this point, I thought a park ranger or maybe even police spotted us, and I was prepared to talk to them and be cool about it. However, they were definitely not police or park rangers. We heard loud music playing as they got closer to us, rap I believe. We also heard multiple voices; they sounded pretty angry. We were now somewhat panicking but did our best to stay calm. By now, we ran to the opposite direction and hid behind a large tree. Partially concealed, we both saw a jeep and maybe a truck (I can't remember correctly) driving very slowly with a very, very bright spotlight at no less than 100 meters away. And man I mean BRIGHT. This spotlight literally illuminated a massive portion of the woods. After driving by, they turned around and slowly drove by again, continuing to search for us. On their second pass, they had their light *directly* on me. They definitely saw me, but fortunately, they didn't get out of their vehicles and pursue us. On their second pass, we also heard ATVs coming down the trail we were walking down. We were both scared shitless at this point, and we knew we had to get the fuck out of there. (Now it was around 01:30.)

We decided to depart quickly and ended up going through dense vegetation and TONS of brambles. We got cut up pretty badly. I have never seen so many thick, large brambles in the woods before. Dawson Forest is something else, huh. The terrain was also treacherous; we crossed several miniature valleys and small cliffs. We thought we would never make it out of there, but finally, FINALLY, we made it back to the car. Luckily, the car was still there, and nothing was wrong with it. By now it was 03:30, and we booked it out of there. I'm very glad they didn't shoot at us or ran after us.

After thinking about the whole ordeal some days later, we still don't have an explanation. I mean, who were those people? We're guessing that they were drug dealers, and they got angry that we were near or maybe even on one of their stashes. We both felt that whoever they were, they had malicious intentions. Surely, they weren't cops or park rangers. They would've announced themselves. Maybe they were government officials? I doubt it. But who would be searching for us with a massive spotlight? Why? Who else would be out there that late? Perhaps someone was just messing with us? I doubt that, too. I seriously wonder who those people were. I think about the experience a lot. Again, we were well aware of all the sketchy things that take place at Dawson, like drug activity, all that government stuff, body dumps, cults, etc. What do you think? Have you ever been on this trail?

I apologize for the rather late reply.

7866,Ct586,"Well, where are we? There’s a looming pandemic, cities and states are taking sweeping actions to protect the population, and the federal government is giving out free money. There are daily briefs coming from the white house, where the message is confusing at best, or a President demands to be treated nicely or he won’t help Americans. As if the looming danger of losing loved ones wasn’t scary enough, the nation's economy seems to have ceased to function in any recognizable manner. The American public seems split between anyone but Trump, or a stance that he is the only one who can save us.  So where the hell are we?
      Let's start with the economy. While I’m sure I don’t need to reference the unemployment numbers or the record breaking drops in the markets these past few weeks. I’ll take a look back , all the way to the far away past of 2018. In that year, starting around February, the markets saw wild swings,most notable the record drops, which at the time were some of the largest ever seen in its history (1). To avoid getting technical, I think large swings are not a sign of stability. Moving onto 2019, the pattern continued culminating in red flags for the markets starting in September. If you are unaware, at this point, the yield curve inverted, a trusted marker for recession, and the federal reserve found itself short on cash. Their solution to this was to pump billions of dollars into the markets for several months(2) giving the illusion of a steady and strong economy. Catching up to today, the apparent instability of the economy, compounded by the emerging pandemic, and the Crushing one two punch of Putin and Saudi Arabia dropping the bottom out of the oil markets have led up to the largest drop in the markets since 1920. Not the strongest economy by any metric.
     With that in mind, where are we as a nation? Throughout history, our nation has turned to its leaders in times of crisis, its institutions stood as a lighthouse to navigate us through the fog and deadly waters. As we turn to this light, we find it dim. The message of this administration was the same as almost every issue it faced. In lieu of listening to the experts sounding alarms, this president chose to take a political stance. A hoax he called it.(3) He played golf, he held rallies, and continued to dismiss it as nothing serious, claiming he had more expertise than the scientist (4). While his response to the virus was at best an ignorant folly, it was his previous actions that truely baffle the mind. He proceeded to disband a pandemic response team, which was designed to respond to these types of pandemics at the same time cutting funding to the CDC, leaving us woefully under prepared. As we look at the current situation, we can see that at every turn President Trump made the wrong choice. His current daily briefs are some of the most confusing spectacles I have ever seen. He continues to spew rhetoric from his rallies, and is immediately contradicted by his vice president, and experts. He becomes hostile towards journalists on the simplest of questions, and spouts his favorite line “Fake news”. He demands respect and appreciation for supplies needed to save American lives as if this were some bizarre new Mario Puzo novel. While this president frets about his feelings he’s sacrificing American lives in the name of his ego. You may even be repeating his talking points, that this virus is a hoax, its just another flu, or that its such a small percentage that there is no reason not to return to work to save the economy. If you agree with these statements, I ask you to name who you’re willing to sacrifice in the name of wealth, which of your loved ones are you willing to lose, because the rest of us are unwilling to sacrifice our loved ones in the name of his economy. 
     This brings us to the political divide currently besieging this nation. Lets face it, on one side we have a party that can’t seem to agree on which direction they should go, and the party itself seems split for the foreseeable future. To their credit, their current message is to save lives. The other side seems to have changed entirely over the past three years. Rallying to President Trumps defense no matter the message. If you haven’t read the Mueller report, I strongly urge you to read it, I will provide a link below. This report is exhibit A as to the doctrine this administration has adopted. This party attacks experts that contradict their desired image, has suppressed witnesses that speak the truth, and shame veterans who signed their names on the line, and fought for this nation. This party has been eroding our institutions, flooding our judicial system with unqualified judges, and attacking the press with the mantra “fake news” at anyone who disagrees with Trump. With the help of a sympathetic network, this party has tailored a message that the American way of life has been under attacked. These other Americans want the United States to fail, and if you don’t fight, they’ll come after you next. 
     To borrow from Mark Twain “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes”. Now this isn’t the first time this message has been used to mislead Americans. This same message was used by the wealthy and powerful in the 1850’s. You’d barely notice the differences between the two. Wealthy slave holding southerners, convinced the mostly illiterate white southerners (literacy in the south was around 30%) that their way of life was under attack, they were told that their rights were being eroded, and that the big bad government was coming for them. This message was so prevalent, that it can still be heard today. You hear it repeadidly that the civil war was about states rights, not slavery, while even a cursory glance at any of the documents drafted for sessecion by the confederacy list the institution of slavery as the key reason for leaving the union. Today literacy isn’t the ability to pick up a book, but the ability to navigate the current technology and social media and understand how it is used to spread information, or in this case misinformation. While the population centers of this nation tend to lean away from the administration's message, rural Americans think they’re under attack. Immigration, jobs, and even the way you talk is threatened by the big bad government. Again the wealthy are telling them that the boogeyman is coming to get them, and only he can fix it. President Trump’s latest press conference was very clear in its message. Toe the party line or no help for Americans in your state. Is this really what we’ve come to? Will there be a bidding war for supplies, the states with the wealth out bidding the poorest of states, leaving these Americans to fend for themselves? Could it be true, that everyone else, and yes I mean everyone else is lying, cheating, and trying to bring you down? Or could it be that President Trump is as crooked as his own history shows? From failed businesses, crooked charities, and an inability to work with anyone else (Gen. Mattis comes to mind.) Please don’t let this man ruin this nation. He will sacrifice it and your lives in the name of his wealth and his ego, that's exactly what his own personal history shows us.
    This pandemic will pass. We will mourn those who are lost and as the dust settles, do we come together and deal with what comes next, or will we continue to allow this man to divide and conquer us? I’ll close with a simple link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksw3Zc7Fh38 and ask you not to focus on the words, but the message. 
Stay safe everyone

7962,SunTzuAnimal,"Atlanta is majority black and has been run by black democrats for decades. Although we’re making headway in making the city a nicer place to live. A lot of the neighborhoods have been gentrified by hardworking, enterprising people such as myself so property values and amenities are going up. SW Atlanta is still pretty rough and makes for decent investing around the beltline, but East Atlanta is just right. Midtown is the gayborhood, Piedmont Park (which is a great place to get on the East Side beltline) and the location of Ga Tech, the third best tech school in the world, so it’s nice too..and of course buckhead is still there filled with young rich sauced businesspeople. 

The northern suburbs between Atlanta and Lake Lanier is filled with tech industry jobs so there are lots of smart breeding Asians, Indians and Whites up there raising families. The schools are excellent.

Above that, is Blueridge. Lots of great hiking and Appalachian culture. Definitely recommend a long weekend up there. I proposed to my wife up there in front of a scenic vista of the blueridge mountains.

The rural areas are a mixed bag but the state usually goes red in elections. It’s just like every other state that isn’t New York and California. The cities want government to solve all their problems. The rural areas value personal sovereignty. 

The southern half of the state is mostly farmland—peanuts mostly—except for Savannah, which is a Southern gem of a city that survived Sherman’s fiery march. Definitely worth a visit, especially in the fall when spooky spirits are about. My hometown, Newnan, is another antebellum town that survived the march so there’s lots of great old pre-civil war houses there. Worth a drive through if you’re headed to Savannah or Columbus. Great restaurants too. 

Atlanta has some fine restaurants too. The eating scene here is fantastic. We’ve also got the best breweries in the South. Three Taverns, Wild Heaven, Sweetwater, Monday Night—Creature Comforts in Athens (home of UGA), as well as Terrapin Brewing.",1585492495,flu0oge

Fort Gordon is here and is pumping a lot of money into the economy though. It's the Cyber Center of Excellence for the Army and now hosts Army Cyber Command.

Not sure what the plan is to bring more but hopefully they follow thru with the decision.

There's boardgame, Riverwalk, and bike riding meetups and whatnot but when it comes to dating and meeting people you either have to belong to a church or live off your parent's money while living a lifestyle that isn't typical of a young 20 something. There's a popular bar called The Indian Queen that a lot of single college students go to where unless your in a frat, are dressed from head to toe in Master's or Vineyard Vines attire or a smoking jacket with bowtie, and are alright with paying $7+ for a solo cup of beer your chances of meeting someone there is slim to none.

Not sure if it's on your list but I'd check to see if Savannah meets your requirements. Outside of that Atlanta and North Georgia is probably where you want to be.

They moved the ballpark here and there are some awesome restaurants around there. There’s also downtown Smyrna and between Marietta and Vinings several downtown areas as well as what I call “you can live here and eat here too” style places. Seems to be the popular trend to create this “downtown” atmosphere with a few restaurants, shops, and condos above it all. My wife loves the Atlanta restaurant scene and I love going to concerts. All of those things are between 10-40 minutes away. We also love kayaking and there are plenty of rivers and parks for hiking within a few hours (or much less) drive. What you’ll learn is even if you live in Atlanta it still takes 20-30 minutes to get anywhere else in Atlanta unless you’re going to the area you live in. It takes us 20-30 minutes to get to most places we visit in Atlanta as well so I see it as a fair trade off. Checkout Pro-Move as well.

8018,the_spooky_sailor,"I haven't lived but have visited multiple times. I always have a great time when I go. There's tons to do and cost of living is good. It's a small historical port town with tons of access to close beaches. They also turn the water green every year for St. Patrick's Day. Tybee, St Simon's, and Jeckyll islands are all short trips and are popular during the summer. If you've ever been to The Outer Banks or watched any Nicholas Sparks movie, the island towns are like that. Florida is a short drive as well. Savannah isn't a sprawling metropolis. The downtown area is right in the water. If you're from Boston, the buildings probably look similar with the old brick and whatnot. Savannah has a public transportation system but I'm not familiar with it. You could take a look at Zillow or Google street view as a virtual tour.

The weather is good but Savannah is definitely in the path of hurricanes during hurricane season. Don't let that deter you though because anywhere you move in Georgia you have a risk with severe weather during the late spring to early fall. You're either going to get flooding downpours, hail, tornadoes, or hurricanes but that's just the way it is anywhere in the southeast. Unless you live in North Georgia snow is pretty much non existent. My family and I always do a Savannah and St Simon's or Jeckyll island trip every summer.

I wouldn't write off Atlanta just yet. The closer you live to downtown the more expensive it'll be but ""Atlanta"" is a large area of suburbs as well that gets cheaper and less crowded the further out you go. You also won't be paying Boston Massachusetts prices to live because the cost of Georgia living is much lower. For public transportation they have the MARTA system that goes out to a lot of those suburbs. In Atlanta you have access to pretty much anything you ever wanted and you can get anywhere in the world you want because the airport is home to Delta and it's massive.

I'd say to make your choice, you need to do a couple day trips to where you're thinking so you can get a feel for it meeting your needs. What people say on the internet or websites do you justice because there's bias. Good luck.",1585506893,fluoqo3

8020,Blacknights,"Commute: Okay, just figured I'd let you know about the lack of mass transit. So bumper to bumper is usually only problematic with downtown Atlanta proper and our beltway during rush hour. Working nightshift will really mix up your commute. Normally it'll make it easier but there is never any guarantees. I worked 2nd shift/nights for 6 months and there still is traffic on the roads going to work but normally it only added a few minutes to my 15 min commute.

The current commute you described is very similar to what you would expect commuting from Gwinnett County into the city. Gwinnett is an entire county of suburb sprawl. Nearing a population of 1 million. The county is on top of everything and public services are great but it's become expensive and the commute into the city is rough. If one bad accident happens on the interstate (which happens a lot), the commute goes from 1.5 in rush hour to 2+ hrs.  

Housing: If you're planning on working in the Atlanta area, to keep your commute down but avoid housing costs. I'd recommend living near but outside the perimeter in northern Fulton or northern DeKalb if you want to live in a cushy area. It's more expensive for housing but you'll save in gas, commuting and sanity. South Fulton has some nice areas, but it's still sketchy as it's slowly undergoing genetrification. South of state route 78 in DeKalb (Exception being the city of Stone Mountain and Decatur proper), people live there but it's not what most people consider ""safe"". 

Gwinnet housing generally speaking north of I-85 and north of SR 316 (look on a map) are generally safe with bubbles of contained neighborhoods. 

Social: Gwinnett is limited, mostly food and minor social events held by cities, it's cute but it's largely family orientated.

Atlanta and Northern Fulton/DeKalb are really where the social life is for our age bracket, concerts, festivals, conventions, circuses, live theatre, all the arts. Bars and club strips, malls, outdoor/exercise public venues. You name it, Atlanta has it. I live in a condo, I can walk across the street to my grocery store, a bar, a pool hall, gym, a church and a Chinese restaurant. But everything around my condo mostly is single family homes. I'm a 20-30 min drive from most concerts and convention venues on an average day.

You claimed a 10% death toll due to starvation, amounting to around 12 million dead. That's just stupid. Since you have trouble reading, I'll paste text from the citation I linked in my previous response.

""Population health did not decline and indeed generally improved during the 4 years of the Great Depression, 1930–1933, with mortality decreasing for almost all ages, and life expectancy increasing by several years in males, females, whites, and nonwhites. For most age groups, mortality tended to peak during years of strong economic expansion (such as 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1936–1937). In contrast, the recessions of 1921, 1930–1933, and 1938 coincided with declines in mortality and gains in life expectancy. The only exception was suicide mortality which increased during the Great Depression, but accounted for less than 2% of deaths.""

""Of six causes of death that compose about two-thirds of total mortality in the 1930s ([Fig. 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765209/figure/F4/?report=objectonly)), only suicides increased during the Great Depression. Suicide mortality peaked with unemployment, in the most recessionary years, 1921, 1932, and 1938. After increasing during the 1920s, mortality due to cardiovascular/renal diseases stabilized in 1930–1932. Tuberculosis mortality had decreased sharply during the 1920s and continued its decline through the 1930s. However, over and above these trends, both cardiovascular and tuberculosis mortality reveal peaks in 1926, 1928, and especially 1936, coinciding with economic expansions. Mortality due to flu/pneumonia was lower during the 1930s than during the late 1920s.""",1585520529,flvbtc6

I'm not so sure if that's right. the [original 1944 Interregional Highway Report to Congress has the proposed routes bypassing Albany,](https://i.imgur.com/AFSgTOZ.png?1) so I don't think a man who didn't become mayor until 1974 and didn't even move to Albany until 1946, had anything to do with that. 

Now, each state had tiers of proposed interstates, from must build down to wishful thinking, and there was a proposed interstate route (I-175, Albany Connector) from Tifton to Columbus, which would have gone through Albany. That route was delisted in 1974, along with several others.

8128,RZRtv,"&gt;Alkaline hydrolysis, or “aquamation,” is used as an alternative to traditional fire-burning furnaces or burials in several states, according to the advocacy group Cremation Association of North America. The group describes it as more environmentally friendly, a “gentler process.”

&gt;Sen. Bill Heath, the legislation’s sponsor, said he brought it to clarify that Georgia law already permits alkaline hydrolysis on paper but that the state board that licenses funeral homes still does not permit it.

&gt;Heath, R-Bremen, said he drafted the bill after hearing from a crematory owner who bought equipment able to perform alkaline hydrolysis but was told he could not use it.

&gt;“It has been an accepted process,” he said.

&gt;Mindy Miller-Moats, a fourth-generation funeral home operator in Tallapoosa, said she purchased a vat to dissolve bodies as a way to give families another option to cremate their loved ones. The process is fast and produces much less energy than combusting fire, she said.

&gt;“Given the option, a lot of families do find that this is less abrasive than fire,” Miller-Moats said at a Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee meeting last week.

&gt;Asked about the watery discharge from the dissolved body, Miller-Moats said the “effluent” produced is made up of harmless compounds like amino acids, sugars, nutrients, salts and soap. Typically, the dissolved water is flushed into an area’s sewage system for disposal, she said.

&gt;Many sewage treatment utilities consider the discharge as “a welcome addition” because it can help clean underground pipes, she added.

&gt;“These are all just the basic building blocks of what our bodies are made of,” Miller-Moats said. “This whole process is taking your body’s natural decomposition process and speeding it up.”

&gt;She noted the process is also used by research facilities, veterinary hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.

&gt;The Georgia Funeral Directors Association backs the bill and alkaline hydrolysis as a more environmentally friendly and efficient cremation process.

&gt;“You’re giving the public a choice (and) this is a much cleaner choice,” Hightower said.

8338,impracticalsubmarine,"For those who could not read the article:
It was an old-fashioned Southern funeral.
There was a repast table crammed with casseroles, Brunswick stew, fried chicken and key lime cake. Andrew Jerome Mitchell, a retired janitor, was one of 10 siblings. They told stories, debated for the umpteenth time how he got the nickname Doorface.
People wiped tears away, and embraced, and blew their noses, and belted out hymns. They laughed, remembering. It was a big gathering, with upward of 200 mourners overflowing the memorial chapel, so people had to stand outside.
Dorothy Johnson has gone over the scene in her mind over the last month, asking herself who it was who brought the virus to her brother’s funeral.
“We don’t know who the person was,” she said. “It would help me to know.”
During the weeks that followed, illnesses linked to the coronavirus have torn through her hometown, Albany, Ga., with about two dozen relatives falling ill, including six of her siblings. Ms. Johnson herself was released from an isolation ward to the news that her daughter, Tonya, was in grave condition, her heart rate dropping.
Like the Biogen conference in Boston and a 40th birthday party in Westport, Conn., the funeral of Andrew Jerome Mitchell on Feb. 29 will be recorded as what epidemiologists call a “super-spreading event,” in which a small number of people propagate a huge number of infections.
This rural county in southwest Georgia, 40 miles from the nearest interstate, now has one of the most intense clusters of the coronavirus in the country.
With a population of only 90,000, Dougherty County has registered 24 deaths, far more than any other county in the state, with six more possible coronavirus deaths under investigation, according to Michael L. Fowler, the local coroner. Ninety percent of the people who died were African-American, he said.
The region’s hospitals are overloaded with sick and dying patients, having registered nearly 600 positive cases. Last week, Gov. Brian Kemp dispatched the National Guard to help stage additional intensive care beds and relieve exhausted doctors and nurses.
Ms. Johnson said that she assumed one of the guests had brought the virus to her brother’s funeral, where “you hug and you kiss and you embrace.” But she had no more information than that.
“Really, there is no face to what is going on in Albany,” she said.
Whether the initial carrier — the whodunit of infectious disease — matters at all depends on whom you ask. But the timing does matter. For 10 days the virus spread, invisibly, and no one knew it was there. By the time stringent social distancing was introduced, on March 22, it was everywhere.
“We’re not blaming that one visitor, but potentially a community is one person away from something like this exploding,” said Scott Steiner, the chief executive of Phoebe Putney Health System, which has taken the brunt of the surge.
“If you get early delivery of it, it shows you what can happen,” he said. “Had that person come in, had a barbecue, visited family and went home, that would have been a different story.”
A big Southern funeral
Mr. Mitchell died suddenly. Emell Murray, Mr. Mitchell’s companion of 20 years, found him in the living room of their home on the morning of Feb. 24, said her daughter, Alice Bell. There was no autopsy, but it appeared to be natural causes, she said, possibly a heart attack.
“He had been up all night,” said Ms. Johnson, his sister. “When she woke up to get the baby ready for school, she found him face down on the floor.”
Dougherty County, dominated by cotton plantations in the 19th century, routinely ranks near the bottom of Georgia’s 159 counties in terms of most health outcomes, with high rates of diabetes and lung disease, and its first coronavirus cases did not stand out to doctors as something unusual.
The night of the funeral, a 67-year-old man who had come to Albany to attend was admitted to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, complaining of shortness of breath, Mr. Steiner said.
The man had chronic lung disease, and no history of travel that would suggest exposure to the coronavirus, and he was not put in isolation, Mr. Steiner said. Staff members figured that he had just run out of oxygen.
The man spent the next week in the hospital, attended by at least 50 employees, then was transferred on March 7 back to the Atlanta area, where he was tested for the coronavirus. Not until March 10 did the Albany hospital learn he had tested positive, Mr. Steiner said. He died on March 12, the state’s first coronavirus death.
By then, the infection was quietly spreading through town. Mr. Mitchell’s longtime companion, Ms. Murray, 75, found herself racked with chills and fever, Ms. Bell, her daughter, said. She was told she had a urinary tract infection and admitted to an ordinary ward, where she was visited by three of her sisters, Ms. Bell said. All three have since become sick with the coronavirus, she said. One of them has died.
‘It hit like a bomb’
On March 10, word reached Albany that the Phoebe Putney patient had tested positive for the virus. A few days of relative quiet followed, and then, in the words of Mr. Fowler, the coroner, “it hit like a bomb.”
“Some of them might have went to the funeral,” Mr. Fowler said. “Some may have been family members of people at the funeral. Every day after that, someone was dying.”",1585658206,fm0hw08
8339,impracticalsubmarine,"The funerals in Albany — of Mr. Mitchell, and then of a man named Johnny Carter, held at the funeral home a week later — quickly emerged as a source of infection.
Of the first 23 patients to test positive at Phoebe Putney, all had attended at least one of the two funerals, Mr. Steiner said. That was easy to figure out.
“This wasn’t like a team of scientists in a bunch of suits,” said Chris J. Cohilas, chairman of the Dougherty County Board of Commissioners. “We’re a big small town where everybody knows everybody. We know who is in our hospital, and we know who went to what funeral.”
Word went out “so quickly and so aggressively” that those who attended either of the funerals should get tested, Mr. Cohilas said. But not quickly enough to prevent an infected person from serving as a juror in a high-profile murder trial that ended on March 12. That set off a new set of infections in the sheriff’s office and the courthouse, he said.
The warnings drove a wedge between people in Albany, said the Rev. Daniel Simmons, the senior pastor of Albany’s Mt. Zion Baptist Church, who, like others interviewed, said he questioned whether the funerals were in fact the sole source of the infections.
“It created fear: Who will be at the gathering that I’m going to on Sunday, that funeral, or that wedding? Do I go? Do I not go?” said Mr. Simmons, whose church was not connected to either funeral. “People began to say, were you at the funeral? That became a question.”
The city’s churches, he said, began to feel unfairly singled out.
“That is the focus: the church, the church,” he said. “It has done damage because there is stigma. There is almost this wall of hostility that has been raised between certain parts of the community and the church.”
Ms. Johnson, whose family hosted the Feb. 29 funeral, said the speculation had been painful.
“I have family members angry because people are saying that my brother was the culprit,” she said. “He’s a dead person. He’s not even breathing. But they’re angry because the rumor mill is saying that he was the spreader of the virus.”
By last week, the question of how the virus had entered the county had been eclipsed by the number of people sick and dying. Mr. Mitchell’s companion, Ms. Murray, has been hospitalized and discharged twice, the last time on March 24, against her daughter’s protests.
“I begged them not to let her come home, but they did it anyway,” Ms. Bell said. “They brought her into this house like a sack of potatoes, on a stretcher.”
Ms. Bell, 49, said she did not have the strength to turn her mother over in bed, and had called repeatedly to ask for help.
“I’m begging for help,” she said. “I’m here with two kids, and I don’t know if I have been exposed to it.”
She feels, she said, “as if they sent my mother home to die.”
Phoebe Putney is diverting patients to other Georgia hospitals at a rate it has never before approached, transferring 40 in a recent 72-hour period, Mr. Steiner said. But he denied that any gravely ill patients have been sent home.
“Anybody we’ve discharged has been discharged appropriately, clinically,” he said.
Mr. Simmons said that many families are struggling to care for the sick at home, and that for some, a sense of panic has begun to set in.
“Part of the control in life is thinking, if you needed help, you’ve got somewhere to go,” he said. “When that is taken off the table, all sense of control is gone, and hope starts fading.”
He read aloud text messages he received over the weekend. “Please continue to pray,” one said. “My mother, my grandmother and my grandfather have been admitted to the ER with coronavirus symptoms.”
Then, later, “My mother has died.”
For Ms. Johnson, only one person mattered last week.
Her daughter, Tonya M. Thomas, was all she thought of while she was in the hospital. The illness had hit them almost simultaneously, but unaccountably, her 51-year-old daughter was the worst hit, with double pneumonia.
“I was trying to feel better so I could come up here and take care of my daughter,” said Ms. Johnson, a retired oncology nurse. “I felt like if I hadn’t been in the hospital I could have advocated for her.”
She arrived in time, at 5:45 on Friday afternoon, to be with Ms. Thomas as she died. She called her “a beautiful spirit,” her family’s center. Her best friend.
She unplugged her daughter’s ventilators and removed the IV tubes from her body.
Ms. Thomas’s husband, son and sister Abrigale were in the room.
“It just hurts so bad, I just don’t understand it,” Ms. Johnson said. “We came together at a funeral of someone we love, and everyone came up and got sick.”

8391,mkhnghn,"'Underlying condition' has been used irresponsibly recently, in my opinion. A lot of people seem to think that someone having an underlying condition means that they have cancer, HIV, or another serious and obvious chronic illness. Something like 40% of American adults are obese and 80% are overweight, 8% have asthma, over 10% have diabetes, 30-50% of American adults have high blood pressure (depending on the demographic). 

When they say ""people with underlying conditions"" they are not talking about the infirm, they are talking about the average American. Stating that someone had an underlying condition just doesn't really convey any useful information to the general public at all. 

I exercise every day and rigorously multiple times a week. I eat healthy, have low body fat, am in great cardiovascular shape and would consider myself healthier than probably 98% of Americans. I also have mild, controlled seasonal asthma.

The focus on “underlying conditions” is a disingenuous dodge at best—an attempt to blame coronavirus deaths on literally anything else, to downplay the problem and make the egregious failure of state and federal officials to respond adequately seem less so.  As you said, virtually everyone has an underlying condition of *some* sort.  Like, I’m outwardly a fairly healthy dude, not overweight, stayed fairly active before getting locked in the house for three weeks... but I’m prone to GI infections.  And if I get COVID, and my immune system has to choose between fighting a bilateral infection in my lungs and fighting one in my intestines at the same time, one of those organs is likely to lose its fight.  So even though I don’t have any underlying respiratory conditions, it could still kill me.

The insane lack of cohesion from the absense of field that is the Trump administration, means everyone in the USA is beholden to whoever the biggest swinging dick is. If your state has a governor that's seroous, your state is probably locked down.

One of the drawbacks of living in a free nation with highly compartmentalized governance is the unwillingness to do what a country like China has no problem doing, using the military to force people into quarentine.

Not a percentage of its nominal value at any particular time, but a percentage of its nominal value *that* year. That's basically the definition of compound growth.

They're who I'm worried about, and ""just have more money"" even when phrased as ""be more financially prepared"" isn't really feasible for many people's situations. I don't want to open the political can of worms, but I'm sure we can all imagine various scenarios that would lead to an inability to build an emergency fund and various federal policies that might be implemented that would help combat them.
2. You're assuming this is the first hit - everything was situation normal BEFORE the crisis.  There's tons of people who were just coming off a long stint of unemployment or who had a major medical expense or who just had to unexpectedly support a loved one who, during that time, burned through their emergency fund, and THEN covid hit.

It took months to figure out the procedures for permits, taxes, etc. to fit within the state and federal laws.

Similarly, it will take some time to get the cash and identify the procedures to implement all of this. It will be weeks rather than months/years, but this stuff sadly takes time. I know it sucks, but anything with government is going to be slow. Hopefully the law was written in such a way that it fits well within the existing systems set up and will therefore be easy for states to implement. Sounded like some states (likely GA included in that) have a relatively antiquated system that runs this stuff, so it might be a little challenging for the state to force everything through it.

Absolutely incredibly ignorant. Most of them have underlying health conditions, if you know what I mean, and I won't feel even a little bad when they end up in a hospital.

What about medicine like insulin? Can we go get more of it from the pharmacy when we run out? Are drive-thrus at fast food places going to be closed now? Are we allowed out of our houses if we stay on our own property? I honestly don't know about all this because I have never been through something like this before.

8828,Solid_Snakes_Ashtray,"The laws of Georgia and the people who enforce them can be almost unbearable. Some towns in Georgia literally just have cops waiting around the corner to bust someone for whatever. The police in Georgia are just overzealous. Victimless charges often ruining people's lives. The last governor tried to end privatization of probation services, jails, and prisons, but the efforts of lobbyism had the laws redacted. Georgia allows privatization of their own justice system and they do it a lot more than other states. If you aren't a high felony charge, Georgia doesn't seek justice; all they seek is your money. This has been illegal in many states for a looooooooong time. We had lobbyists keep it that way here, and the Georgians in power allow it all the time. I find it awful. And just look at this governor ????

The wealthy are who have incentives to live here. Rights extend to the ""owners"" of whatever and never to common renters or leasers. Georgia also has shit wages for a lot of jobs; half of employers either want you working less than 25 hours a week, or you're working like 80. 

Georgia doesn't consider the constitution of America when making its laws unless the federal govt forces them to, which is what's happening here. Georgia doesn't care about people. 

Also, as I get older, I'm starting to realize GA is a cesspool of congestion and illnesses. Every year I get more and more sick of allergies and humidity. 

Rednecks and blindly conservative politics get on my nerves, and so does all the congestion and traffic of every town within the suburbs of Atlanta. I'd move to the middle of nowhere in GA, but then there'd probably be some small town cops who can't help but harass people. 

I've had police in Senoia GA plant evidence of marijuana on my friend and I. At the time, we were detailing the car intending to sell it and we hadn't smoked weed in some months. I was able to miraculously beat these charges because some people in court the same day as us had the exact same story as we did almost, and it involved the same two officers. 

I have a certain distrust for Georgian law enforcement that is deeply-rooted. 

I KNEW Georgia was bullshit some years later when I ACTUALLY DID get busted for some weed around Amarillo TX , and the trooper didn't even care, and let me drive off with the weed! TEXAS STATE TROOPER.  I also can't even recall what a CO officer even drives around in--in all those years, I barely ever saw them. You can tell which states are after common people by how many police officers there are. I've driven straight from Albuquerque to Atlanta without once seeing an officer, and as soon as I roll into Carrollton, they're almost blockading the interstate and crawling around everywhere. Yep, we're home! Thanks for making us feel ""safe,"" Georgia. I promise you have a lot more money than we do. Let's face hundreds in fines for victimless traffic charges, and go to jail when you don't have the money. Happens all the time. 

A third of people who have charges at all in Georgia are offenders in which there is no identifiable victim. The courts are an overzealous joke! They don't protect anyone. All they do is secure their own financial assets by leeching off the public as much as possible. Of course other places do this, but I don't know anywhere in America lurking with as many shitty cops as this place. 

Plus, America is beautiful. I've seen about all I can see in this place. I've been all over, from the rockies to the UP of Michigan and the great lakes, upstate New York is awesome and gorgeous, even Philadelphia is pretty cool(traffic sucks), hell I really loved it in Clearwater FL too. I've fallen in love with the southwest and the rockies. When I wake up here it's either a police doing a buck 20 in the middle of the night, or the mechanic shop across the st, or the traffic building up outside, or my Mexican neighbors having a party (which is fine, they're just so close), or the tow yard behind me with a constant *dong, dong, dong* backing into some shit, ect. In Georgia I've lived in Newnan, Kennesaw, Marietta, east Atlanta, Griffin... 

Palmetto is a quiet town where the cops don't mess with people. Try Grantville and Senoia if you want to have police harass you for no reason. I'm just different in my age. I'm mostly sick of all the traffic and congestion of GA, the police/laws, hip-hop culture is strong here and I just am not into it. 

In the southwest I can just drive to uninhabited lands and pitch a tent on the weekends if I feel like it and see the unpolluted light of night skies, and nobody will care. Atlanta-area, I'll be paying out the ass for a less-good experience. 

I can go on and on. I'm just over this place. Tired of ended up back here. But I'm saving money",1585787731,fm6760j

You really need to call, and be patient with whoever answers. Call the district office, because they are way nicer and more patient. They’ll have a computer program where they can look you up by name and address and they can record your concerns with an issue tag. If you’re not in the database, they’ll need to add you, and if you want your concern documented, you need to cooperate. (You’ll likely be in touch with an unpaid intern or an underpaid secretary, and they’re really trying their best). 

If you absolutely must email, try to find their staff’s email address. It’ll usually be [firstname].[lastname]@[congressperson last name].[senate or house].gov. Sometimes, if you call their office and ask for a staffer by name or title, they’ll give you their email.

Another, more abrasive route, is to find the staffer on twitter and message them there. Sometimes they’ll have their DMs open (like Loeffler’s CoS, Joan Kitchener Carr) and you’re in luck.

I only recently started paying attention to the politics here and trying to do something about it.  When I went to vote for Stacey Abrams (and NOT Kemp) in the last race for governor, the poll workers in my little dumb-ass redneck voting precinct were all loud ""Good Old Boy"" Republican types. One of them refused to stop standing behind me and looking over my shoulder as I voted at the voting machine.  As I finished, he glared at me disapprovingly, and he said some things that gave me the strong impression that he was gonna find some way to make sure my vote didn't actually get counted.

When I got home, I looked online to see how I could report some possible voter tampering/intimidation/fraud at the polling location.  I found out that I would need to report it to the office of the Secretary of State. So I googled who the Secretary of State in Georgia was (Like I said, I was new to trying to keep up with politics).  It was Kemp.

(By the way, I just watched Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper talk about Kemp's big fuck up, and I wonder how much it was hurting the two of them to NOT just come out and call Kemp a fucking idiot on air. Man, must have been tough.)",1585852241,fm8muag

I mean on February 28th Nancy Pelosi was walking around China Town giving hugs to people and saying it’s nothing. Trump and Kemp were doing the same thing because it hadn’t spread yet. Do I wish he shut down the state 1 month ago, yes, but was anybody fully shut down 1 month ago? I think this pandemic actually shows why we shouldn’t rely on government officials to tell everybody what to do. Better off taking care of yourself and avoiding getting sick.  There  are a few key patients in this pandemic who effed everything up for everybody because they were being selfish. It was theorized that coronavirus was spreading via asymptotic people but not proven early on. Literally almost every leader in every country across this globe has been slow to respond with a small exception so blaming everything on Kemp is not fair. I highly doubt we would be better off with Abrams as governor because she would have had the same information Kemp has had. Now she does believe the government should control every aspect of everyone’s lives so maybe she would have shut things down earlier but not because she was trying to save lives, it would have been to prove our need and reliance on government leaders. And a majority of the public sector has been shut down now for a few weeks, it’s the reckless fee businesses and church’s and idiots that are really screwing us.

Visitation has been limited to nursing homes. Schools have been closed. Almost any industry in GA can try to claim they are essential and so the businesses that have remained open are going to remain open. We’re in this mess because people thought social distancing didn’t apply to them. The only thing Kemp could have done to change the outcome would have been some form of marshal law which in the state of GA would have resulted a drastic increase in gun related deaths and more panic. Seriously, it’s individual citizens fault for where we are at this time. People were still working when they were sick or visiting relatives in nursing homes when they knew just as easily how transmissible this virus is. They had the same information. People love to blame the government for failures when the buck actually stops with each individual person and their own reactions. I personally have had my kids out of school for 2 weeks longer than anyone and I’ve been wearing a mask and gloves into every store I’ve had to go in. I am in healthcare and so my quarantine starts over everyday because I don’t have a choice about going to work. Because of my work my kids and wife haven’t seen a single family member in over 1 month. That has nothing to do with Kemp, it’s selfish individuals that think they are exempt.

He also didn’t go into specifics about the industries that are exempted from the shelter in place. For example, construction: I understand the necessity of roadside and repair work, but I work as temporary renovation support which technically falls under construction yet nothing about the job is a necessity for the company I work for during this time. I work in a still fairly crowded office in Atlanta, so under this new guidelines I am still required to show up. I have no issues with going to work in order to be productive, but putting myself and others at risk when our job is non essential seems ridiculous.

I'm glad you are an informed citizen. Most people aren't. Governors should understand that &amp; must lead the uninformed citizens even more than the informed ones. Many people hang on every word their leader says and they follow their directions. For better or worse, a leader understands that. They understand that the world is not perfect &amp; what they say and do matters. 

Shutdowns work.  [AP FACT CHECK: Trump claims rising suicides if US stays shut](https://apnews.com/34f0d353e3cf9b507bed8815ff25b21b) You don't have to install martial law to in the first step. Merely asking people by ordering a stay at home policy works fairly well. Most idiots will eventually listen. The evidence of that is everywhere. That's why you have to do this earlier just like many states did.

Kemp waited to long to make the right decision. Other leaders knew what to do. Kemp did not because (if you believe him) he failed to gather all of the information he needs. He even said he would have done it sooner if he had known. That is his job. Metro Atlanta has been shutdown for a while because of the mayor, but rural Georgia has not &amp; Kemp failed them by not having information that has been out there for [2 months.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread-study/index.html) This is bad leadership of epic proportions. 

What kind of leader says, ""I don't take any responsibility at all."" Leadership is about assuming responsibility. We all wish every person did the right thing, but leaders must protect the smart people and the the idiots. There's no perfect solution, but you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

9527,reddittiswierd,"So I went back and listened to some of his previous press briefings. I agree, if Kemp had no idea this was spread by asymptomatic patients then yes, he is the laughing stock of the world at this moment. However, it is clear this was not new to him as he even mentioned this March 16th during a press briefing about nursing homes.

I believe he finally closed the state likely due to the mounting pressure coming from citizens and recommendations from different health officials and I truly believe he was probably waiting for Trump to do some kind of nationwide closure and that’s why he delayed for so long. I even signed the change.org petition to close the state when it first started. 

Is it possible he forgot what he said back in March and this news finally clicked and then he repeated the news on Wednesday, yes. But, I believe the real information he got from the CDC and health officials lately is likely the fact that people are passing the virus just by breathing and talking in close quarters. That’s more than likely what he was told recently that would have changed his decision to close the state earlier than what he had stated. I agree he needs to apologize for his mistake and probably try his best to clarify but I think people need to calm down on the attacks towards him personally for this mistake as measures were put into place earlier in March because they knew asymptomatic patients were passing the virus, hence why schools were closed many weeks ago. 

So yes I agree with you that if he really didn’t know this fact until recently then that would be pure ignorance and really unforgivable but I strongly believe he misspoke and I hope he is able to clarify. I feel the actions they have taken argue that he was aware the entire time.

### Filing for Unemployment During the COVID-19 Public Health Crisis

**CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) ACT**

The US Department of Labor (USDOL) held a national call on Thursday, April 2, to discuss the implementation of the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act.  As you know on March 27, 2020, the President signed the CARES Act to expand unemployment insurance benefits and other economic relief measures aimed at reducing the economic impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic and authorized $2.1 trillion in aid to various sectors of the economy.  This economic relief package is in addition to the Family First Corona Virus Response Act.

CARES includes the following:

* Provides for Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation of $600 weekly in addition to regular state benefits;
* Extends state unemployment benefits by 13 weeks of federally funded benefits added to the end of regular state UI benefits; and
* Expands eligibility for those not eligible for regular, extended benefits, or Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation including self-employed individuals, independent contractors, those with limited work histories, and those unable to work due to the enumerated COVID-19 related reasons.

The GDOL signed all of the necessary agreements last Saturday to access funding for this program. The USDOL directed states to wait for specific guidance on implementation procedures for this federal program before distributing funds on behalf of the federal government. Commissioner Butler was insistent on the call that they complete this process as soon as possible that Georgians cannot wait a week or two for guidance on this bill and need to put food on the table today.  The Labor Commissioner has asked Governor Kemp to call the White House to see if they can push the USDOL into action.

We will continue to process and release payments for regular state UI claims.  We will act quickly to implement the new federal program and make these funds available to Georgians as soon as we are given the approval by the USDOL. We have been assured that we will be able to backdate any payments for all eligible weeks beginning March 29th.  The GDOL is ready to act on these new provisions and has proactively programmed 95% of the platform in anticipation of the upcoming federal guidelines.",1585928595,fmblafb

My point is that the kids of the current boomers will be more rabid than their parents because they hear the bs their parents are telling them all the time. The only cases in which it won't happen is if the kids are more educated than the parents.

9689,bigbadboomer4bernie,"Just for the record, Ralston is a true human scumbag. Not just because of his political beliefs and his wlllingness to subvert democracy to ensure his hold on power.

He's a friend to child rapists and domestic batterers. He helps criminals not just evade the law, but deny the law. He has a private practice as a criminal defense attorney. Nothing wrong with that, our system of laws guarantees everyone a right to a speedy and fair trial and to representation. I'm totally OK with that.

Well, in Georgia the law guarantees MOST people the right to a speedy trial. But not the people victimized by David Ralston's clients. Years ago, Ralston helped draft a law that allowed attorneys who were also state legislators to delay court proceedings in cases they were involved in, so they could complete their legislative duties and then tend to their legal duties after the legislation session was over.

Sounds legit, right? Well, it wasn't. Because the way Ralston used the law was to delay trials indefinitely ... and by indefinitely, I mean for a DECADE at times. In the case of an Ohio preacher accused of repeated child rape the case was delayed from 2012 until 2019, at which point the preacher was able to secure a plea deal that involved a decade of parole and no prison time after admitting his guilt for sexual battery of a child. Repeat: no prison time for sexual battery of a child.

As has been said, ""Justice delayed is justice denied"" and [Ralston has cynically delayed justice for many of his clients.

From the AJC:

&gt;Just as Ralston has done for other clients charged with violent or heinous crimes, he used his elected position to delay hearings and court dates, preventing the case from moving forward in the Gilmer County justice system.“That’s why I gave him 20,000 bucks,” Shell told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “He’s worth every penny of it.”

Shell is a wife batterer. Other clients benefiting from Ralston's crooked ways include people charged with child cruelty, assault, terroristic threats, drunk driving and other crimes.

And Ralston isn't acting as a canny defense lawyer helping his clients in a trial here. Ralston is PREVENTING trials here. Literally PREVENTING justice, using a legal dodge that HE helped draft into law.

So this business of being against mail in ballots because they hurt the GOP and for no other reason is just part and parcel of the complete scumbag and piece of shit that is David Ralston, Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives. Know him for what he is.",1585971527,fmdmau3

Georgia's large number of counties has more to do with controlling power. Since the city with a county seat was guaranteed wealth and jobs, if there was a ""second city"" in a county, they would appeal to the legislature to create a new county for them.

Creating a county in Georgia was relatively simple when compared to other states, it required a simple vote, where others required a constitutional change. 

Around 1900, Georgia switched to a county rule system, which led to the creation of about 30 more counties. The county rule system was used to keep rural areas of the state in power in state level elections.",1586033749,fmfs7hs

&gt;""As the Pentagon ordered 100,000 body bags to store the corpses of Americans killed by the Coronavirus, Governor Brian Kemp dictated that Georgia beaches must reopen, and declared any decision makers who refused to follow these orders would face prison and/or fines.

&gt;While the beaches have to reopen under the Governor’s order, Tybee will not have beach access and parking lots will remain closed until further notice. It should also be noted that Tybee currently is not properly staffed with Emergency Medical Services and there are no life guards in place. At no time has the state designated a single point of contact to orchestrate the implementation of the Governor’s plan.""",1586044683,fmgaf2x

Especially in traditionally red states, we can’t move forward by shouting back until we’re blue in the face. At the end of the day the politicians all over hype the red v blue when actually we all have more in common with each other than we do with them. When people make political parties personal, they take critiques against a politician as a personal insult and get defensive. 

They all work for US. They literally pay millions and millions of dollars to dance and sing in front of us on TV and in rallies for months just to gain our favor. We have all the power yet people don’t vote because they think it doesn’t matter and we waste time bickering over colors like this whole nation became the crips vs bloods.

**Q: It’s Spring Break. Can I go to the beach?**

If a Georgia city or county took emergency action or used an emergency declaration to close their beach then that beach is now open. However social distancing rules and limiting gatherings to 10 people still apply. If a beach or park was closed as part of a standard local ordinance it will remain closed.

**Q. What about the rules my city/county set earlier?**

The governor’s order supersedes all local ordinances that that conflict with the state order. Local rules can’t be stricter or looser and any emergency actions taken are overruled.

You could have stopped there.  You don't give a single fuck how ignorant, incompetent, lazy he is as long as he feeds your racism, hate and bigotry.

&gt; rough around the edges he is

Is that what you call glorying in adultery, or maybe you mean paying women to spank his old fat flabby ass.  Or do you mean his daily twitter man child meltdown as he insults world leaders.  Did you see the video or world leaders mocking and laughing at him.....everyone in the world does.   But, hey I appreciate your acknowledging you don't give a single fuck about ethics, morality and values.   Never mention them again, or people should laugh in your face and point out your are a donald cultist. 

&gt; who’s never done an honest day’s work in his life.

Ha ha ha ha ha.  Thanks for the laugh.  You think donald has done ""an honest days work"".  Thanks for the laugh.  You people are so fucking gullible.  Never forget donald hauling has fat lazy ass around the golf cart every three days instead of actually working for the sole reason of lining his pockets with tax payer money.

&gt; If you want to deal in facts rather than emotions,

Yes, I do.  That's why donalds ignorance and incompetence is particularly horrible.  Never forget donalds ""it's 15 cases and going down"".   Never forget donalds white house ""it's contained"".   Donalds incompetence will literally kill thousands of Americans needlessly and has ensured this will be a depression, donalds depression, instead of a recession.   Every single person that dies is on donald and republicans, every single person out of work is on donald and republicans. 

&gt; That should tell you all you need to know about why people support Trump.

Pure rationalization at it's finest as donald spends every third day at a one of his golf courses to illegally line his pockets with millions of dollars of tax payer money.  So spare me your ignorant rationalizations, you don't give a fuck about any of that.

&gt; As Harry Truman said, an honest man can’t get rich in politics

100% agree. So...back to donald spends every third day at a one of his golf courses to illegally line his pockets with millions of dollars of tax payer money.    Back to Ivanka negotiating trade patents with China while working as an ""advisor"" to donald.  Jared, while being a white house ""advisor,  using Saudi Arabia to strong arm qatar into ""investing"" hundreds of millions in Jareds failing real estate business.   You don't give a fuck about any of that so it highlights the fact you are blatantly lying in your defense of donald, like a good little donald cultist. 

&gt; fleeced by career politicians

Democrats are fighting for medicare for all, so the US can join the other 32 of 33 first world countries that have universal healthcare.   Donald and you are fighting for a wall to keep brown people out.  See the fucking difference. 

&gt;  It wasn’t Trump who sold us out to China

It was donald who has been incompetent and ignorant in the handling of this pandemic leading to the needless deaths of thousands of Americans an has insured a depression.  

I always tell kids you want to know what republicans / conservatives stand for....look at ""grab some pussy"" donald.   Look at his adultery.  Look at his fake university where he scammed thousands of working class people and had to pay a $25 million dollar fine.  I love showing girls donalds tweets and statements about women.....they are disgusted by you people.  I love pointing out donalds hatred, racism, and bigotry against anyone who is not an old white straight fundamentalist.   I love pointing out to hispanic people donalds / republicans comments about Hispanics and Mexicans.  The hate and the bigotry.   

Donald is an exact reflection of the values, ethics, and morality of his supporters....and you.  Please keep wearing your russian red traitor hats so people know the ""type"" of person you are.

The Court settled on the three trimesters of pregnancy as the framework to resolve the problem. During the first trimester, when it was believed that the procedure was safer than childbirth, the Court ruled that the government could place no restriction on a woman's ability to choose to abort a pregnancy other than minimal medical safeguards such as requiring a licensed physician to perform the procedure. From the second trimester on, the Court ruled that evidence of increasing risks to the mother's health gave the state a compelling interest, and that it could enact medical regulations on the procedure so long as they were reasonable and ""narrowly tailored"" to protecting mothers' health. Since the beginning of the third trimester was normally considered to be the point at which a fetus became viable under the level of medical science available in the early 1970s, the Court ruled that during the third trimester the state had a compelling interest in protecting prenatal life, and could legally prohibit all abortions except where necessary to protect the mother's life or health.",1586109747,fmihmru

I dont smoke pot and haven't for 8 plus years now. But when smoking pot I didn't have the time to be lazy, I had a job to do I worked 6-7 days a week 12-14 hrs a day and made good money doing it also. I also smoked weed all day started with one in the morning, que lunch and a couple of more times through out the day, I stopped to pursue a different field of work and with it I'm not able to smoke. I would surely like to but due to my company drug policy I cannot partake without the risk, my bosses do not care but they're quick to remind me of the what if side of it if there was an accident. I'm in a management role currently and would smoke my back out given the chance, at home at the end of my shift and days off responsibly, However I believe it's the individual who chooses to be lazy, believe me on my off days and vacation weeks when I can get them I don't want to do anything and I'm not currently smoking pot. I choose to be a lazy slob wearing pajamas all day not doing shit. As for my kids sure, I would definitely set that example for them. Work hard, earn your keep and know when to relax and know that all medicine doesn't have to be in pill or liquid form. Just my experience of course I'm not rich nor do I care to be and I'm not equating success with smoking or not smoking pot either but one shouldn't be considered a criminal or a lazy peice or shit for smoking weed. I'm not saying folks are wrong for having their anti marijuana opinions either but I really hope that someday they might reevaluate opinions of weed smokers and drop the stigma associated with it and realize not all weed smokers are completely stoned stupid all the time.

Second, the reason the other poster said that Republicans hate her and won't vote for her is that there is an established MAGA candidate, Doug Collins, running in a jungle primary.  Trump wanted Collins in the seat when Isakson retired. In the general election there will be a runoff between the top two placing candidates which could very well be Collins and the Democratic candidate since the Republican vote will likely be split between Collins and Loeffler.
