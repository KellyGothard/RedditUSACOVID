Literally the only thing that this law changes is that poor people will have the same access to pretrial release that people with money have always had. 

Bail, properly applied, has absolutely nothing to do with how dangerous someone is. It's only an amount of money to ensure your appearance at future hearings.

States are much more likely to stay the same creed as opposed to federally.

There‚Äôs no way not to politicize the distribution of government money and when you do it at the state level you can generally count on the funding to be there in a few years time. A study at a federal level would also take a very long time and adding that it is a federal rural study that could take years and years.

In the rare case that they serve sentences consecutively, it would make a difference but I don't see them doing a misdemeanor consecutive to a felony.

Robbery, in and of itself, is violent by nature, as it means to take by force. There are levels of robbery such as robbery with a gun, robbery with bodily injury, etc, but by itself robbery it considered one of the violent crimes by nature.

From the Bureau of Justice:

""Violent crime includes murder, rape and sexual assault, robbery, and assault.""",1577986659,fcuqv1s
171,skatenox,"So as for Spectrum having a hand in 100% broadband you have to look at the definition of broad band speed and what their general infrastructure plan looks like. 

FCC definition of broad brand is 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. 

Spectrums residentially infrastructure delivery plan is primarily dependent on coaxial cabling (not fiber) utilizing either DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 (with 4.0 in development) these technologies are capable of delivering broad band speed no problem, the limitation is that because it uses an electrical signal it sees an issue with distance from Spectrums equipment locations to a residential location. Typically this maxes out at 30 miles in practical use. 

If you‚Äôve ever been any where rural 20-30 miles is not that far, throw in mountainous terrain with only logging roads from 25 years ago and it‚Äôs much more challenging.

The most effective way I‚Äôve seen these problems solved is to use fiber optics and GPON technologies. You are no longer limited to an electrical signal that faces resistance, you now use light with significantly less resistance and the ability to double or triple the distances that Spectrum is working with. 

Spectrum is a business that focuses on population dense areas. They‚Äôre not in the business of handouts to folks in the woods so they‚Äôre already behind the 8-ball as a hope to solve these problems. 

So we have the technology to get everyone to the FCC definition of broadband. The issues are that the vast majority of costs are man hours for hanging fiber on telephone poles. ~10% of that cost is material the other costs are man hours and equipment to do it. Road work safety is massive for this. 

It starts to fall into the domain of a water utility or electrical utility at this point as there‚Äôs virtually no way to do that at a profit. Grants were an answer to this however these avenues were pulled back after a few years of massive privatized infrastructure investment.

However, i'm not confident that it wouldn't take 20+ years or more to see serious traction.  People are more divided than ever it seems and getting people to agree on municipal run broadband seems like a tough row to hoe because I think it'll be looked at as government expansion.  Plus, the government is looking at your data memes would be floating all over the place and I think people are pretty susceptible to blanket statements/thoughts and can be easily swayed in the wrong direction.

204,BullsLawDan,"&gt;The bail system is exactly that, incentive for you to return to court. 

It's not exactly that. It's supposed to be the **least** amount of money that both (1) allows you to be out of jail pending trial, and (2) ensures your return for future hearings. 

The problem is, DA's were abusing the system and judges were going along with it. They would set bail too high for a person to be released, and wait for them to get sick of sitting in jail so the defendant would take any plea just to go home. It caused a **generational** destruction of entire communities. 

For years, people brought this up and DA's pretended to care, well, finally, the people took their tools away.

&gt;It's all based around whether or not you'll return to court, and how much of a danger to society you are. 

No, the amount of bail in NY never was designed around ""how much of a danger to society you are."" In fact in most cases and in most ways judges in NY were explicitly prohibited from considering that.

&gt;Also: Great details on those numbers too bud. Without what those numbers represent and the source for them they're totally useless. 

[Here's one story about the NJ results, the numbers of people who showed up for trial fluctuates from 89% to 91% depending on the source](https://whyy.org/articles/n-j-officials-have-finally-released-data-on-bail-reform-their-conclusion-its-working/)

California and DC have similar numbers (behind academic paywalls if you have access), but the overriding theme is that there's not a big change in how many people show up for trial with these reforms. 

&gt;But yeah. Throw some useless statistics at me say a snarky comment and walk away, probably for the best anyway huh? Perhaps next time offer a fucking explanation instead of literally useless shit and bitchy little comments.

377,McFlare92,"ALBANY, N.Y. ‚Äî Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vowed on Wednesday to legalize marijuana in New York, prioritizing a push that fell apart last year amid tensions over who should be allowed to sell the drug and where the revenue should go.
The governor described the effort as a long overdue criminal justice reform that could help salve wounds in communities affected by the decades-long war on drugs.
‚ÄúFor decades, communities of color were disproportionately affected by the unequal enforcement of marijuana laws,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said in his annual State of the State address. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs legalize adult use of marijuana.‚Äù
The effort comes as the state faces down a $6 billion budget gap; on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said that legalized marijuana program could bring in $300 million a year in tax revenue, and billions of dollars more in economic activity when fully implemented, though that could be years away.

The governor‚Äôs proposal was part of a lengthy agenda that included bids to boost environmental spending, support small businesses and address a range of social ills, from overpriced feminine products to a lack of diversity on the state‚Äôs farms.
Little mentioned, however, were specific answers to how to solve the looming budget deficit, which is largely a result of overspending on Medicaid.

Mr. Cuomo did not say whether he supported raising taxes on the wealthy ‚Äî a proposal popular with progressives in his party, including the Democratic-led State Assembly ‚Äî or cutting spending to tackle the fiscal imbalance. Instead, Mr. Cuomo said that he wants to slice tax rates for small businesses by a third, something he said would help some 36,000 taxpayers.
At the same time, Mr. Cuomo retained his penchant for higher-priced infrastructure projects, proposing to invest $300 million to repurpose the Erie Canal to attract tourists, $9 million to build a drone facility upstate and an unspecified sum on an ambitious plan¬†[to revamp Penn Station](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-penn-station-nyc.html)¬†to accommodate an additional 175,000 riders by building eight new tracks.

‚ÄúProgressive government by definition must be functional,‚Äù the governor said, returning to a common theme and citing his father, the former governor, Mario M. Cuomo.
The governor‚Äôs address kicks off the start of the year‚Äôs legislative session, and comes on the heels of a historic year in Albany, where lawmakers passed¬†[major new laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/nyregion/albany-wrapup-legislature-ny.html)¬†on¬†[rent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/nyregion/rent-protection-regulation.html),¬†[climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/nyregion/greenhouse-gases-ny.html)¬†and¬†[congestion pricing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/nyregion/congestion-pricing-new-jersey.html), among other issues.

Last year was also a period of transition for Mr. Cuomo: For the first eight years in office, Mr. Cuomo worked with a Republican State Senate, which often backed his pleas for fiscal austerity and batted back progressive reforms. That changed in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the Senate with the help of a number of young, liberal candidates who repeatedly challenged Mr. Cuomo, sometimes leading to¬†[heated conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/governor-cuomo-fundraiser-albany-budget.html).
That rift has already surfaced this year, as the governor and other Democrats grapple with the political fallout from a new law that sharply reduced the use of cash bail. The law went into effect on New Year‚Äôs Day, and since then, concerns over a spate of anti-Semitic incidents and other recent¬†[alleged crimes](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Albany-man-accuse-of-woman-s-death-set-free-under-14944854.php)[¬†committed](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/01/04/long-island-burglary-bail-reform/)¬†by those released have led to calls for changes in the law, including by Mr. Cuomo himself.
Mr. Cuomo made no mention of the bail reform on Wednesday during his speech, which included quotations from George Washington, Henry David Thoreau and the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, and an extended nautical theme, with mentions of rocky shores, rough seas, and a ‚Äúpolitical and social superstorm‚Äù of anger and divisive rhetoric.
Considering the state‚Äôs financial straits, Mr. Cuomo leaned heavily on proposals that would need little or no state funding, like banning gun ownership for people who have committed certain misdemeanor crimes in other states,¬†[banning foam food containers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/nyregion/styrofoam-ban-new-laws-ny.html)¬†and outlawing synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl.

The governor‚Äôs marijuana proposal came with numerous caveats: He said that he intended to coordinate New York‚Äôs plan with similar efforts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut, though his office later clarified that the state would not wait on other states to pursue its own plan.
He also proposed that New York‚Äôs state university system be enlisted to do research on marijuana and its effects, likening the drug‚Äôs potential peril to that of opioids.
‚ÄúThe federal government failed Americans with opioids,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said, in a briefing book released with the governor‚Äôs speech. ‚ÄúAnd we cannot allow that to happen with cannabinoids.‚Äù
The governor‚Äôs agenda ‚Äî entitled ‚ÄúMaking Progress Happen‚Äù ‚Äî also outlined a robust list of social proposals, with many geared at improving women‚Äôs status in the state, including studies to increase representation for women on corporate boards (California just enacted a¬†[law](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/women-boards/)¬†guaranteeing that) and $20 million in grants for female entrepreneurs. Mr. Cuomo also promised to take aim at the so-called pink tax, by which businesses charge women more for services and personal care items.

Mr. Cuomo has trumpeted his actions on gay rights ‚Äî including legalizing same-sex marriage in 2011. His top-line proposal for the L.G.B.T.Q. community ‚Äî permitting paid gestational surrogacy ‚Äî had failed to gain enough support in 2019, after some advocates for women‚Äôs rights and religious groups¬†[argued that such surrogacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/nyregion/surrogate-pregnancy-law-ny.html)¬†commodifies the body.
On Wednesday, even before Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs speech ended, the state‚Äôs Catholic Conference, said ‚Äúsurrogacy is a dangerous policy that will lead to the exploitation of poor, vulnerable women, and has few safeguards for children.‚Äù
Mr. Cuomo also said that he supported paid sick leave for workers of businesses with five or more employees, and wanted to codify benefits and protections for workers of the growing gig economy, although he did not offer specifics.

Other ideas were recycled, like an equal rights amendment to establish factors such as sex and sexual orientation as protected classes; a law change to allow movie theaters to sell alcohol; and a law to allow automatic voter registration. That idea passed last year, but was waylaid by technical legal concerns; the legislature will pass it again on Thursday. The governor also brought out a revised version of an idea that he recently vetoed: legalizing e-bikes and scooters.

Like last year, Mr. Cuomo made the environment a cornerstone of his agenda: He proposed leveraging $3 billion in bonds to restore wildlife habitats and mitigate flood risks, while offering plans to preserve 4,000 acres of land in the Mid-Hudson Valley and upgrade the wastewater treatment plant at Lake George, a popular vacation spot.
‚ÄúNo economic strategy, no social justice reform, no education policy will be worth a damn if we don‚Äôt have a planet that we can live on,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Cuomo also took aim at sexual predators, proposing legislation to ban high-risk sexual offenders from New York City‚Äôs subway and prohibit them from using social media, dating apps and video game chats.
If 2019 was any indication, Mr. Cuomo tends to get what he wants from his yearly wish list. The overwhelming majority of his proposals were approved last year, except for marijuana legalization.

 The long answer, for me, is you're ostensibly the property of the State.

It's not worth it, financially, to spend tax payer money on the beurocracy required to handle such a thing, and some would argue unfair (i.e.: Why should I have my money going to help someone who decided to off themselves? Not my position) 

 It was only in 2007 the State decided they can't just kill people, prohibiting capital punishment, and also until fairly recently, illegal to even attempt suicide in most of the U. S. 

If it's legal for a state to take your life because the deme that you've wronged them, but illegal to take your own for whatever reason I don't see any real basis for it besides a means of control. You are the property of the State and do not have the right to make decisions for them.

Barbaritano will remain free until his Wednesday court appearance. If Bararitano does not go to court for his arraignment, Albany County Judge William Carter must wait 48 hours before signing a warrant for his arrest.

Police and prosecutors say that in early July, Barbaritano wrapped a nylon-styled belt around Nicole Jennings' neck, tied multiple knots, tightened it and plunged a knife into her throat.

612,QuiGonMike,"First off, thanks for an intelligent response instead of insults.  I agree with some of what you say.  As for unions - Private unions are fine but public ones drive me crazy because there is no one representing the taxpayers at these meetings where unions get pretty much whatever they want and in turn support the candidate that showers them with gifts. Its BS. The gauranteed raises, ridiculous pensions that will cause major financial headaches soon, incredible health care, etc, etc.  Its a gold mine and as a privately employed person I get the bill for THEIR benefits and have to deal with my own.  It aint right. 

As for services.... thats another sticky issue since a lot of us pay for these services but dont get anything from them.  Sure, Florida has less services but if you dont need them then why wouldnt you go there to avoid paying for them?  We have far too many people ""milking"" this stuff and coming u with areative ways to soak the taxpayers for free stuff.  I dont think anyone minds helping those truly in need but its gone too far the other way where its a game now to see how much people can exploit it.  I guess Id rather live somewhere with less services and lower taxes.  

Maybe you're right about Cuomo - perhaps he isnt ""left"" enough but Im not a fan of most leftist policies.  I prefer to handle my own problems and not rely on the Govt to dictate my life or taxthat much of my income for ""feel good"" stuff. Im a working class guy and just want to keep more of what I earn.  I also want to pay off my house and NOT still have a large monthly bill(stupid property taxes) to pay.  Thats why so many are leaving the state.

Ah. Well, I'm here to tell you, as someone who is far more expert here than you, that your common sense isn't correct.

In other jurisdictions that have removed cash bail and made lower level offenses ROR, removing bail has basically not even moved the needle on how many people show up to court. In NJ for example it's still around 90%, which is the same percentage it was at before they removed cash bail.

So, to be blunt, your ""common sense"" is wrong, and you need to listen to people who actually have done the research on this.
 
&gt;I don‚Äôt believe the old system was perfect, but at least there was a financial cost for those who fled. 

See, again, this is your ignorance. For most people there wasn't. A bail bondsman pays the bail. The person pays the bondsman a non-refundable fee. They aren't getting that back whether they show up or not. 

What you need to do here is admit you really don't know what you're talking about, and listen to people who are telling you what is going on, without some reason to lie (for example, elected Sheriffs and DAs who have an incentive to keep conviction rates high, even if it puts innocent people in jail).

&gt;This bail reform has not only helped the poor get released, it has also helped those with means to flee. 


No, it hasnt.

&gt;On top of all this is: When someone flee‚Äôs who goes after them? In the past the bail bondsman (who have a financial interest) would.

Well, for starters, there are a bunch of former jail deputies sitting on their hands, now that there are 80% fewer people in jail.

But what you don't realize is it's not even a major issue. Bail or not, the vast majority of people show up for court, and the ones who don't are by and large not running, but aren't showing up for some other reason. Like not knowing when they need to appear, or not having transportation, or needing to work, or needing child care, and so on.",1579458383,fezktis

Dangerousness has never been a factor for these crimes in NY.

If you think the bondsman pays all that money without some kind of guarantee, you are naive. This means there is a non-refundable cost, plus maybe your moms house, car, or other promise to pay. For example, I personally had a $50k bond. I put up $5k plus 2 vehicle titles and a boat title. 
I still believe that people charged with what I consider serious crimes ( stalking, 2nd degree manslaughter, assault, robbery, burglary) if given the chance to flee...will. Maybe because I don‚Äôt live in a place where such crimes are commonplace. 
If it is illegal to force a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù person to pay bail, it is also illegal to force ‚Äúrich‚Äù person to pay bail. 
I think you misunderstand the job of a jail employee. They are custodians and you what to make them into bounty hunters. I believe the vast majority of them would be completely outmatched.

* $225 million in new grants and tax credits to fund ""high value regional priority projects"" through the regional councils, while separately making $525 million available from various state agencies through the regular Consolidated Funding Application process
* $100 million for the Downtown Revitalization Initiative that seeks to spur the transformation of urban neighborhoods into ""vibrant communities""
* $57.5 million to support the state's tourism campaign, including an eighth round of $15 million for the Market NY competitive initiative to encourage regional collaboration for tourism marketing that promotes regional attractions
* $220 million for the New York Works Economic Development Fund, for capital grants to support projects that create or retain jobs, or that pay for infrastructure investments needed to attract or expand companies
* $34 million to support the New York State Economic Development Fund, the Minority- and Women-Owned Business Development and Lending Program, the Urban and Community Development Program, and the Entrepreneurial Assistance Program
* $5 million for the Innovation Hot Spots and Incubators Program, to encourage collaboration between schools and businesses, while offering support services to startup companies to turn academic research into business opportunities
Cuomo also wants to extend the Excelsior Jobs Tax Credit program, setting new credit caps through 2039 and allowing companies to benefit from their unused credits through 2049. Those credits are only awarded after a company achieves employment and investment goals.

The governor is also proposing a new Green Jobs Tax Credit as part of the Excelsior program, boosting the regular credit for eligible projects to encourage new employment in environmentally friendly jobs.

  1. With respect to any principal, the court in all cases, unless otherwise provided by law, must impose the least restrictive kind and degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure the principal's return to court when required. In determining that matter, the court must, on the basis of available information, consider and take into account information about the principal that is relevant to the principal's return to court, including:

  (a) The principal's activities and history;

  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;

  (c) The principal's criminal conviction record if any;

  (d) The principal's record of previous adjudication as a juvenile delinquent, as retained pursuant to section 354.2 of the family court act, or, of pending cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant to section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;

  (e) The principal's previous record with respect to flight to avoid criminal prosecution;

  (f) If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions set forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances, and, in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to post bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his or her ability to obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;

...

&gt;An NYPD officer and his fianc√©e who allegedly starved and abused his autistic eight-year-old son, taunted the child for being cold as he collapsed from hypothermia after being forced into an unheated garage overnight in 'freezing temperatures.'

&gt;Micahel Valva, 40, and Angela Pollina, 42, attempted to emulate the Brady Bunch with their blended family - Valva's three sons and Pollina's three children- but that facade fell apart after little Thomas Valva died on January 17. 

&gt;Valva‚Äôs initial story ‚Äì that Thomas was trying to catch the school bus and died after falling in the driveway - quickly came apart as homicide detectives investigated the death. 

&gt;Audio obtained by authorities from family surveillance footage at the couple's home, captured him mocking and joking about his son, who as suffering severe effect from hypothermia that would later kill him, to his fiance. He was also recorded telling her he was 'f**king suffocating' the child. 

&gt;The couple was arrested at their Long Island home for second-degree murder on Friday by Suffolk County officers.

&gt;The tragic incident began when Valva became enraged with Thomas and proceeded to beat the child before banishing the boy to the family's frigid garage when temperatures were a bitter 19 degrees that night.  

&gt;The following morning, Thomas was so cold that he was 'face-planting' on the floor because his body had gone into hypothermia, according to Assistant District Attorney Laura Newcombe who cited extensive audio recording's taken from home security footage. 

&gt;Nearly every room was set up with surveillance cameras to closely monitor the children, with labeling based on the child's name and room.  

&gt;The camera found inside the garage was ominously labelled 'kids room.'

&gt;Thomas and Anthony Valva, his older brother, were seen on camera sleeping on the garage's concrete floor and 'shivering' two nights before the boy's death.

&gt;‚ÄôThey are on cold concrete. There are no pillows, no blankets, no mattress,' said Newcombe.

&gt;New York Post reports that one of the other children asks why Thomas can't walk. 

&gt;Pollina said: 'Because he‚Äôs hypothermic. When you wash with cold water and it‚Äôs freezing out you become hypothermic'.

&gt;She later asks Valva the same question only to receive a callous response from the father. 

&gt;‚ÄôBecause he‚Äôs cold. Boo f**king hoo,' he said, according to prosecutors at the couple's arraignment. 

&gt;At one point, Pollina walked into the garage and asked Valva what he was doing. 

&gt;‚ÄôI‚Äôm f**king suffocating him that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing,' Valva said, prompting Pollina to answer, 'Take your hands off his mouth. There are people everywhere.'

&gt;Before calling 911, Valva is said to have placed the boy's cold body in a warm bath to raise his core temperature.

&gt;Authorities were dispatched to 11 Bittersweet Lane around 9.40am following reports that Thomas had fallen in the driveway and lost consciousness.

&gt;Responding officers found Valva performing CPR on Thomas in the basement before he was rushed to Long Island Community Hospital and pronounced dead.     

&gt;Thomas' body temperature was just 76 degrees - 21 degrees below a normal temperature - when doctors later attempted to revive him.

&gt;‚ÄôThe medical examiner has ruled it a homicide with a major contributing factor of hypothermia. We believe certainly that Thomas was kept in the garage overnight preceding his death,' Suffolk Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said, according to NBC News.        

&gt;In addition to hypothermia, Thomas also suffered head and face injuries that were not consistent with Valva's story. 

&gt;‚ÄôWe have determined Thomas was never in the driveway that morning and he suffered head and facial injuries that were not consistent with the father's account.' 

&gt;Besides Thomas, Valva's six-year-old and 10-year-old brothers lived with the couple, as did Pollina's 11-year-old twin daughters and her six-year-old son.  

&gt;The home security footage also helped investigators discovered that Valva's other sons were punished with 'food deprivation and exposure to extremely frigid temperatures.' 

&gt;Newcombe said that authorities had conducted a welfare check at the home in May 2019, but the family was not home. 

&gt;The remaining children have been placed in Child Protective Services.

&gt;‚ÄôWe are still investigating the extent of the abuse and if it extended to all of the children,' said Hart.",1579998055,ffjh0m8

Higher floor apartments are quieter.

Pay attention to what streets the apartment is facing - especially the bedroom. Garbage trucks, trucks, bus stops, subway grates, etc... Walk around the neighborhood during rush hour to assess ambient noise.

Most apartments are shown with the windows closed, open the windows to get a feel for noise levels (try to see apartments at rush hour).

Check the address against the DOB complaint website. You can see if there are consistent complaints from tenants (heat, hot water, noise, rodents, structural issues, etc...).

Check the garbage collection room, make sure it is well maintained and clean. 

Make sure the ""street door"" is well maintained and secure.

Check the heat source. Some apartments include heat and some do.

Is the AC thru the wall? Or will you have to put ACs in the windows during the summer (added expense, plus you'll need room to store them during the winter). 

ALWAYS change the key cylinder to the front door when you move in ASAP.  You have no idea how many other people may have keys to the apartment. Previous tenant and their friends, dog / cat sitters, contractor who painted apartment,  realtors who showed the apartment, etc.... huge safety issue for new tenants.

You don't need years to get vetted. As a matter of fact, if you are illegal and even commit a small crime, you get deported. There's a reason why the 11 million undocumented in this country are not gone. The government knows who they are.

The First United States Congress, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, met from March 4, 1789, to March 4, 1791, during the first two years of George Washington's presidency, first at Federal Hall in New York City and later at Congress Hall in Philadelphia. With the initial meeting of the First Congress, the United States federal government officially began operations under the new (and current) frame of government established by the 1787 Constitution. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the provisions of Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution. Both chambers had a Pro-Administration majority.

Didn't say they weren't connected, but literally since ancient times, you could move to an empire or kingdom but not be a citizen. For example, in Rome there were people who lived there but were not considered citizens of the empire.

As for so-called absence of evidence, the way that debating works is that the burden of proof is on you to prove otherwise, not the other person.

Slaves were black, there was no such thing as a document that says they must be black, because black and slave were synonymous words.

1115,hgghjhg7776,"&gt;The fight against illegal immigration is more about xenophobia than it is about anything else.

So you either support open borders or you're a racist? I find it difficult to reconcile that argument.

&gt;Contrary to popular belief, illegal immigrants don't cause an increase in crime.

I live in an immigrant heavy community. There are plenty of undocumented people here, they work hard and follow the law. But it is disingenuous to argue allowing tens of millions of unvetted people into the country wont include bad apples. It's not right when a legal resident is a victim of a crime committed by someone who isnt supposed to be here. I think anyone convicted of a crime should be deported. Put the hardworking, otherwise law abiding undocumented on a path to legal status. 

&gt;The truth of the matter is, the immigration system isn't hard because of vetting, but an attempt to maintain white Americans as the majority.

This is disingenuous. 1965 immigration laws spear headed by Ted Kennedy (D) changed the immigration laws opening up the country from poor and developing countries away from European centric immigration. 

&gt;Like I said, most are here to work, not rape or steal or whatever. 

Trump is cracking down hard on legal immigration as well.

Agreed.

However since then and the rise of nationalism, the Tea Party, and a post-9/11 world, immigration has become more and more restricted.

As for your first point, I should make it clear that I do not support open borders, however I am arguing that due to such restrictive immigration laws and procedures, illegal immigration is left as the only option for many not grandfathered into the system.

I also argue that the present restrictive immigration laws are based on fear of other nationalities and people, hence xenophobia. 

Furthermore, the fight against illegal immigration is based on such xenophobia and racism, evidence includes the use of dog whistles, stolen jobs from ""real Americans"", hence making the argument based more on nationalism than actual security. We see such comments come alive through fear mongering of things like the caravan of refugees with Fox news focusing their forecast on them 24/7, comments about shithole countries, etc. 

As for bad apples among illegal immigrants, I should make it clear that I am against the current system and advocate for the system to be reformed so those bad apples are properly vetted.

I think if you're a country, you need to have a rule of law, you need to maintain your borders and vet those who would cross them. And it does irk me that as a naturalized citizen, so many people cheat the system, even if it is broke. What place would I have as a non citizen to disregard this country's laws, even the broken ones?

We also have to take into account the countries that people are illegally coming from, countries like Guatemala and El Salvador which currently suffer tremendously from anarchy, civil war, drug wars, extreme gang violence, etc.

People are not cheating the system because they want to, it's because they have to.

The Equal Protection Clause is a clause from the text of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides ""nor shall any State [...] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"".

A primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which guaranteed that all citizens would have the guaranteed right to equal protection by law. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the Civil War.

     5  veterans is critical to ensure successful re-entry into  civilian  life.
     6  Studies  have shown that time outdoors can be a valuable adjunct therapy
     7  in addition to more traditional health care, while also  reducing  reli-
     8  ance  on prescription medication. The therapeutic benefits of time spent
     9  outdoors is clinically proven  and  is  known  to  help  reduce  stress,
    10  improve concentration, and promote overall well-being, both physical and
    11  mental.  Outdoor-based  therapeutic programs hold particular promise for
    12  people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress  Disorder,  Military  Sexual
    13  Trauma,  Traumatic  Brain  Injury,  and Substance Use Disorders. Outdoor
    14  programs including adventure therapy, wilderness therapy,  horticultural

    16  currently being used by mental health professionals  and  are  shown  to
    17  have  benefits  including reduction of stress, restoration of attention,

     3  to  residents of the state, particularly veterans and individuals recov-
     4  ering  from substance abuse or a physical or mental trauma, the legisla-
     5  ture supports the establishment of an outdoor Rx act.

     7  consultation with the office of parks, recreation and historic preserva-
     8  tion,  the  department  of environmental conservation, the department of
     9  health, and the office of mental health, review:
    10    a. barriers that exist to provide veterans with  increased  access  to
    11  state  lands  and  opportunities  for medical treatment and nature-based
    12  therapy and programming, including barriers to transportation,  handicap
    13  accessibility,  cultural  barriers, mental health stigmas, public aware-
    14  ness of state outdoor resources, lack of experience in the outdoors, and
    15  funding for public and private programs;
    16    b. current state policies regarding  free  and  discounted  access  to
    17  state  parks,  lands,  and recreational facilities by veterans, service-
    18  connected disabled veterans, gold star families, and other military-con-
    19  nected individuals;
    20    c. opportunities to formalize coordination  between  the  division  of
    21  veterans'  services,  other  state  agencies,  and partner organizations
    22  regarding the use of public lands or other outdoor spaces to  facilitate
    23  access, medical treatment and nature-based therapy for veterans;
    24    d.  state  lands,  based  on veterans' demographics including, but not
    25  limited to, service-connected disabled veterans, that should  be  prior-
    26  itized for access;
    27    e.  recommendations, following consultation with appropriate veterans'
    28  outdoor recreation groups, to reduce barriers and better facilitate  the
    29  use  of  state  owned  and  managed lands for access, preventative care,
    30  medical treatment, and nature-based therapy; and

1304,asafum,"Come on now, no one but the opposition ever says anything about ""free stuff."" We would all be paying through taxation, not just one group or another unless you're super poor in which case we should all be wanting to help these people anyway. We have a real bad tendency to imagine all poor people as all lazy and that it's 100% their fault. My brother is just one small example, but he's not mentally disabled enough to be considered disabled for state care, but in no way can he ever hold a job that will pay enough to support himself. It's not his fault he was born with this condition and I can't afford to pay for all of us on my own. Some people are even more intelligent than him, but still not capable/intelligent by no fault of their own to find/do a job that would pay ""enough."" As a society we should all look out for each other.

Instead of the $12k/year my boss pays to the insurance company we would all be paying a much lesser amount in taxes and not have to pay at the hospital. Now imagine if you had a great employer that wanted to maintain your compensation, so maybe not all 12k as you figure for taxes, but imagine something like 9k extra in ""cash"" to you as they aren't paying for your insurance anymore but want to maintain your compensation. The same goes for tuition, if we get tax funded education that we all pay for then students will be putting as much money as possible back into local economies once they start their careers as opposed to being loaded with debt and trying to save as much as possible.

The plan would tax your employer at the amount he pays now for your plan. So you'd be trading private funding for an oligopy for a public taxed monopoly. How's that work in places like Italy? You have long waits and denials of service for minor non life threatening things, but sure good care for emergency stuff. And they pay more in taxes. Oh and people who are better off? Still have private insurance because well, the government runs the Healthcare.

Want to make college more affordable? Flood the market with supply. Instead of cheap credit that removes the risk from the lenders and drives up the cost of tuition because of rent seeking. College enrollment is down because the cost benefit isn't there.  Instead of free tuition why not more capable schools producing real life skills?

That pesky thing called profit which is in theory a feedback mechanism on the system that we rely on heavily to produce positive outcomes is producing negative outcomes at an ever increasing rate and to an ever increasing degree. Bernie is not saying profit is a bad feedback mechanism universally. He's saying the evidence is there that it is a NEGATIVE feedback loop in this particular system that is promoting and reinforcing negative outcomes and that we need a DIFFERENT feedback mechanism to bring the system back in alignment with our desired outcomes.",1581465645,fhclupn
1318,UEMcGill,"Don't take me seriously, I don't care.  You're 'distilling' the argument down incorrectly.  It's simple.  Economics doesn't lie.  Replace one poorly performing economic system with another, even worse performing system and you will get an even worse outcome.  European systems are small compared to the US.  The biggest country? Germany, at about 1/4 the size of the US.  It has a blended healthcare system.  Single Payer systems are countries like Italy.  Where corruption and denial of service are rampant.  All of them are fighting cost overruns and lack of capacity.  So why do you think we're all that special that it won't happen to us?

Bernie doesn't understand economics or unintended consequences.  It's a horrible idea that will turn into the biggest boondoggle in the world.  It will start off ok.  But then the government will need to increase the size of the agency.  Then government workers will get fat pensions, and oh now we have to include this job and that job, etc.  Then they'll start telling doctors ""We'll only pay this much"" because hey we can negotiate prices!  And doctors will say, ""Fuck you.  Don't pay me that."" and only take private insurance.  And then, the government will have to tell them ""Ok, no more private insurance"" and then doctors will say ""No thanks"" and many will leave, but also many won't become doctors, because hey they can go into research or something else, and not have to deal with the government.

These are a small minority of the country's population.  Their greed and desire to have it all is leaving the vast majority of people to be living day by day.  There are so few people in New York who have any sort of retirement money, so few who can afford to take any more than two weeks of work, so few who have reasonable health care.

Yeah, the top few can afford to take a few hits.  They'll get no tears from me.

So the wealthy and the businesses get to enjoy huge profits on the back of ""cheap"" labor.

1363,IrishinManhattan617,"&gt; OK - lets just agree to disagree.

Listen, you sound like you have some money and you're trying to protect it.  That's fine for you, but it's a selfish mentality to say ""fuck the majority of the country, cause I gots mine.""  And that's exactly what you're claiming, and you forgive yourself by saying ""anyone else could have what I have if they just worked harder"" but that is literally a myth, a total fucking myth, which leads you to believe that everyone who doesn't have what you have simply doesn't deserve it.  It's fucking sad.

&gt;  Oh and its ironic how the usually very ""left leaning"" unions have NO interest in Bernies free, crappy health care.

First, unions are EXACTLY what Bernie loves, because unions fight damn hard to ensure that their workers actually have real health care.  That's the reason why they don't care as much about healthcare, and its also why Bernie wants to increase union membership by 2x.

Second, unions have been near eviscerated in the past few decades by major corporations, such that union workers, and those with good health care, are no longer the norm.

Third, it's a lie to say unions have NO interest in Bernie, nothing more than a long list of lies you seem to be telling yourself.  The following unions support Bernie, and you should ask yourself, why?

*  American Postal Workers Union (200K workers)

*  National Nurses United (150K workers)

* United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (50K workers)

* National Union of Healthcare Workers (20K workers)

And while major national unions have not endorsed ANY candidate, it's noteworthy that the LOCAL branches of national unions HAVE endorsed Bernie.  For example, the NH LOCAL branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) (the 2nd biggest union in the US) broke with the national union's ""non endorsement"" policy and endorsed Sanders.  And its not ""small"" local chapters doing this: the Los Angeles local chapter of American Federation of Teachers (AFT) (the 3rd biggest union in the US) also endorsed Sanders.  And the largest local chapter of United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) (the 6th biggest union in the US) endorsed Sanders.  

And if we look at 2016, we can expect many of the major unions to endorse Bernie.  In 2016, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) (the 7th biggest union in the US) endorsed Bernie over Hilary.

&gt; Health care is readily available to people in this country

Another lie.  Literally 30 million people have no healthcare, and thousands go bankrupt due to medical bills.  That simply is NOT how it is in every other major democratic western nation.  On what planet do you live that you think folk have ""ready"" access to healthcare.  Most folk literally hold off on medical care due to the expenses involved.

&gt; I love how Bernie used our health care to get his heart trouble taken care of so fast. Ironic, isnt it?

I don't think you understand what irony is.  Bernie is a senator which means he is covered under the  Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).  That program is 90% of what he is suggesting should be extended to all americans, as that program is subsidized by the federal government that amounts to about 3/4 of a person's subsidies being paid for BY THE GOVERNMENT.

Literally you are arguing from a place of complete ignorance.

&gt; Its OK for him to be rich but not anyone else. Fail.

Another retarded argument.

He isn't saying you are evil for being rich, he is saying rich people should pay more in taxes.  As a ""rich"" person, he would be subject to his own taxes, so he isn't an exception.

Cool, so we agree, though I'm confused when you say ""possibly education"" - are you seriously suggesting we shouldn't pay taxes for free education of children, like seriously?

&gt; Im sure if we removed the bloat and BS that we wouldnt need to tax people as badly as they want to. 

I love when folk say this ... okay, cool ... so the annual budget is about 4 trillion each year.  In order to have some sort of MATERIAL impact on your taxes, you will want to cut 1 trillion of that spend, but even that only reduces taxes by 25% ... I would argue you really want to kill 2 trillion to see a real impact (assuming a similar decrease in state taxes.  

If you make $500K, reducing the budget by 25% will likely save you about $60K of $250K paid in federal and state taxes.  But reducing 50% will save you big money - $125K of the $250K you paid.  

So here is my simple question - look at a regular budget (not Trump's budget for this year because its bloated as fuck).  Pick Obama's last budget when he was president, and identify what you'd cut.  Seriously, I challenge you.

What you'll find is that the costs to maintain what is ""necessary"" is pretty fucking high.  The only real source of bloat is spending on the military ... if you want to cut that, I'm 100% behind ya.

&gt;  the public unions are a bad idea(even FDR thought so) and add a lot of cost,

So all public unions due is fight for workers rights.  So what exactly is it that, say, postal workers get, that you think is a ""bad idea"" that would save MATERIAL costs?  Seriously, how are postal workers ruining america?

&gt; and then programs on top of programs that spawn more programs. Govt is like a virus.

This is rhetoric - give me SPECIFICS.

&gt; Flat taxes get everyone equally. A rich guy will pay MORE than a poor guy with a flat tax because XXX% of a million bucks is more money than XXX% of 100K bucks. Right?

A flat tax also means that a poor person gets hit with taxes on necessities.  It means that a poor person has to pay 20% (or whatever) on necessities, and that should not be the case for obvious reasons.

&gt; Right? Why do we want to penalize success?

This is such a stupid fox news talking point.  You aren't ""penalizing"" success.  Those who are successful, STILL MAKE MONEY.  They just don't make as much money.  The reason is that penalties need to increase with wealth in order to stay a penalty (a $300 parking ticket to a postal worker is NOT the same as a $300 parking ticket to a millionaire).  The other reason why is that we believe that those who are wealthy don't ""deserve"" the money because they are ""better"" than other human beings, they were simply able to get there money.  If you actually know wealthy people, they are NOT smarter than average folk in MANY instances.  They aren't ""better"" in terms of much of anything other than luck or opportunity.  

&gt; Why is that so ""in"" now? 

You do realize that the United States has taxed the rich SIGNIFICANTLY MORE for a very long time.  It is actually only ""in"" now, since Reagan, not to tax rich people.  Bernie's tax rates are returning us to tax rates that America had for DECADES in and before the 1970s.

There are plenty of people who do not have drivers licenses (minors, elderly who gave it away, handicapped, people who don't care to drive etc...) and get around by other means.  Whether it's a bus or Uber or family or whatever.  

So we know for a fact that there is at least a certain segment of NYS population that does not have drivers licenses but would still be eligible for these Trusted Traveler programs.  Honestly, i'd be interested in knowing what percentage of NYS Trusted Travelers do not have a drivers license.  

Why couldn't the Fed just make NYS drivers licenses not an acceptable form of identification for the Trusted Traveler program instead of banning the entire state?  (Politics aside)  

That's the part that i'm having an issue with.  I think that there are plenty of people who are in these programs already who do not have drivers licenses so the Fed wouldn't get any information from NYS DMV anyways because they are not in that database.",1581688562,fhkp60a

1451,joez37,"&gt;I‚Äôve been working in public schools in a very low-income area for the  last few years and I fully believe that would have changed things for  the kids I work with and their communities. Bernie‚Äôs idea of guaranteed  federal jobs would do nothing to address families who are already  working and can‚Äôt make ends meet and would not give these families the **much** needed time with their children.

I'm not against UBI. I think we should give it a shot on a smaller scale to start with, say, in a poor state like W. Virginia and see what happens. Once we work out the kinks, we could implement it nationwide perhaps. I would be all for experiments like that, and Bernie is an open- minded guy, I think he could be persuaded to do such an experiment. After all he was alerting people about climate change in the eighties and warned people about getting embroiled in the Middle East before the first Iraq war. Not to mention being decades ahead in advocating for gay rights when he first started politics. 

With regard to helping working families, you have to admit that Medicare for All would help out A LOT. I looked at Yang's plan and while I like his ideas for incentivizing cost-cutting and such and preventive care (all things we definitely ought to do), it would not immediately help out lots of struggling people (87 million with no health insurance or underinsured) who need healthcare. Lots of states have not extended Medicaid to low-income adults so those people are now out of luck, and it is such an expense and burden that it could very well eat up the whole 1k divdend for some families. Bernie also has policies to directly increase the SS payouts to low-income disabled and older Americans. He is also advocating universal daycare and college as you know. With help on all these problems, a lot of struggling working families could be helped.",1581698152,fhlb0lo

You should source the other boroughs for places as they‚Äôre all still close to the city and an easy commute in (most places you live outside of manhattan won‚Äôt take much more than 20-40 mins max on the train, sometimes 10 mins if you live right on the edge of a borough). You have to keep in mind that the more prime or known or desirable the area is, the more you will end up paying for a lot less space. You can find some pretty spacious (spacious by NY standards that is) apartments in areas you may know a little less about, that will be a lot more affordable than the tiny closet you‚Äôll be spending life savings on in Manhattan. Some neighborhoods to check out in Brooklyn: Crown Heights, Bed Stuy, and Prospect Park have apartments with great bones, I lived in a really nice place in Bed Stuy and I‚Äôve seen some stunning older buildings in Crown and Prospect that were really affordable. If you don‚Äôt want to live as far south in BK, a lot of Bushwick is affordable. If you want a more hyped Brooklyn neighborhood, (hyped in this case meaning one you‚Äôve heard more about) Greenpoint and Williamsburg could be for you. Both neighborhoods are a bit more expensive but you‚Äôd be close to Manhattan and it would still be more affordable than Manhattan (and you‚Äôre a close train stop away). Don‚Äôt look at DUMBO in Brooklyn because it is the number one most expensive area to live in New York (but do visit there because it‚Äôs stunning).
For Queens, a lot of people choose Astoria or on the other end of Queens, Ridgewood (which is closer to Brooklyn). Some areas of Queens are not as close to the trains so be sure to research your areas a bit if you‚Äôre looking there.

&gt;Now, as part of its detente with Cuomo, the utility is set to offer a menu of options to meet demand, including barges carrying compressed or liquid natural gas. 

If they are getting barges of natural LNG delivered because there is not pipeline capacity, how was it a ""gambit"" of any sort?

1754,dynex811,"Okay I am not doing any more research on this. But, NY leads the residential deaths in raw numbers but not in rate. NY has had 268 residential fire deaths in the last two years (Jan1 2018 to Jan1 2020) while Kentucky has had 113. That means NY has had almost 14 deaths per million people while Kentucky has had 25. In fact out of the other high death states I looked at ([source here](https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/civilian-fatalities/incident/reportMap)) New York isn't all *that*  bad. Please note these numbers come from media reports.

&amp;#x200B;

|State|Population|Res. Fire Deaths|Rate per Million|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NY| 19,540,000 |268|13.7|
|KY| 4,468,000 |113|25.3|
|TN| 6,770,000 |145|21.4|
|MO| 6,126,000 |123|20.1|
|MI| 9,996,000 |200|20.0|
|PA| 12,810,000 |245|15.5|

So New York does not lead in rate of deaths. Now on to causes:

For New York I have found very few hard statistics for fires causes. According to the [Health Department of NYS the leading cause of fires are cooking, mainly caused by people leaving the kitchen unattended](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/injury_prevention/children/fact_sheets/10-19_years/home_fire_prevntion_10-19_years.htm). The problem is I don't know if this is a nationwide statistic and no definitive numbers are provided. I have will email them cause now I'm curious. 

According to FEMA, the nationwide [leading cause of Fire is cooking at 51%](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/statistics/#causesR) but this is *nationwide.* According to the fatality statistics for NY there is no real useful information as 90% of the causes are under investigation but not many outright point to heating (though with the majority under investigation that's not sayign much). You can search it yourself [here](https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/civilian-fatalities/incident/reportList?id=New%20York&amp;format=html&amp;page=1&amp;listFormat=&amp;mapFormat=&amp;searchStartDate=Wed%20Jan%2001%2000:00:00%20EST%202020&amp;searchEndDate=Sat%20Feb%2029%2000:00:00%20EST%202020&amp;searchCause=&amp;searchResidentialBuildingType=&amp;searchChildren=&amp;searchOlderAdults=&amp;searchDisabled=&amp;searchMale=&amp;searchFemale=&amp;searchMulti=&amp;searchSmokeAlarmsNotPresent=&amp;searchSmokeAlarmsPresent=&amp;searchSmokeAlarmsPresentDisabled=).

Okay now for non government sources, according to the Fireman's Association of New York the major causes are [not having a functioning smoke alarm and improperly maintained heating equipment](https://wbng.com/2019/12/17/fasny-new-york-leads-nation-in-fire-deaths-in-2019/). I have not been able to find the stats they used but I'll keep looking.

According to the National Fire Protection Association, heating accounts for only [15% of fires and of those space heaters cause 44% of incidents and 86% of heating related deaths.](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/US-Fire-Problem/Heating-equipment)

So as of right now I cannot believe that this gas shortage is causing deaths. That said nothing here disproves it either the fact is there is not enough evidence for me to draw on. But that means that it is unlikely there is enough evidence for others to draw on also. 

So PLEASE if you have a source linking the shortages to fires I want to see it because I spent too much time looking this up when I have work to do.",1583009376,fj4izrq
1755,ofd227,"You'd have to examine NFIRs data from OFPC to get a actual number of heating related home fire.   I will the majority of fires I've been to are always heating related from using wood or coal due to lack of access to cheap heating fuel (hint natural gas).

1757,tootie,Who says we are starved for natural gas? That's the energy companies who are fighting Cuomo's demand for more renewable capacity. We don't *need* gas. We need *energy*.

Furthermore these are national level statistics not for NY, and if we don't know the proportion of New Yorker's who uses these sources compared to the national average then how does national level statistics help us understand the impact of a localized natural gas shortage? 

&gt; When people don't have access to cheap and safe heating options they turn to alternative heating sources which causes house fires 

We also don't have any source which states there is an increase in alternative fuel sources. If it's common sense then it should be easy enough to find.

The only thing your source shows me is that solid fuels are 2X safer than electrical and that for the utmost safety we should be using Kerosene or Oil heating systems. What it doesn't show me is that there is a spike in deaths",1583012690,fj4nx4s

ALBANY, N.Y. ‚Äî Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of coronavirus cases in New York rose to 89, which include a Queens driver who worked for Uber and two unexplained positive tests of patients 200 miles to the north.

Moving on multiple fronts to curb the spread of the virus, Mr. Cuomo said the state of emergency would allow New York‚Äôs government to respond faster by lifting regulations.

The governor‚Äôs announcement came as concerns about the outbreak grew in New York City, which has 12 confirmed cases, up from six that were disclosed as of Friday. The epicenter in New York State continues to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there are 70 cases in total.

These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities‚Äô attention after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York‚Äôs second coronavirus patient.

State officials said they were testing dozens of mouth and nasal swabs from people who might have been exposed to the lawyer, who has been hospitalized but whose condition is said to be improving. Technicians are working around the clock at private and public laboratories, including a major site near the State Capitol.

In the United States, more than 380 cases of the virus have been confirmed, and at least 19 people have died, according to a New York Times database.

Despite the spread in the state and the mounting toll of the virus, which has killed more than 3,500 people worldwide, Mr. Cuomo sought to calm the public during a news conference in Albany.

‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs worse than the virus ‚Äî the anxiety,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said, noting that most patients would suffer mild or no symptoms.

The declaration of emergency will allow the state to speed up the purchasing of supplies and the hiring of workers to assist local health departments that have been handling the monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said.

‚ÄúSomebody has to go knock on their door, once a day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is labor intensive.‚Äù

The declaration would also allow officials to skirt purchasing regulations, if necessary, he said.

Still, there were signs that the outbreak was spreading, including a pair of patients in Saratoga County, north of Albany ‚Äî the first such confirmed cases outside of the New York City region.

On Friday night, the Uber driver from Queens tested positive, and the case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into voluntary self-isolation over fears that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.

The man, 33, walked into St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.

Dozens of workers at the hospital are now being tested, officials said.

‚ÄúObviously, 40 people are out,‚Äù said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. ‚ÄúThe hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.‚Äù

Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said that the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday, and that hospital officials were monitoring everyone who might have been exposed to the patient.

A spokesman for Uber, Andrew Hasbun, confirmed that the man worked as a driver for the app. The company is assisting health officials to determine whether the man exposed passengers to the illness, Mr. Hasbun said.

The man was not licensed to pick up passengers in the city or at its two airports, but he was free to drop off passengers in the five boroughs, the company said. Those limitations might affect the number of people he exposed to the virus.

Other cases in New York City include three family members who live in the Upper West Side, two Brooklyn women in their 60s and 70s who showed symptoms after returning from a cruise in Egypt and a Brooklyn man in his 30s who remains hospitalized after visiting Italy, one of countries with the biggest outbreaks outside China.

Several of the new cases announced on Saturday in upstate New York added a layer of mystery to exactly how residents were contracting the coronavirus.

In Saratoga County, the two new cases involved a 57-year-old pharmacist and a 52 year-old woman who may have contracted the virus through contact with a Pennsylvania resident at a conference in Miami.

The source of contraction seemed more direct in Westchester County: All 23 new cases announced on Saturday involved people who had been in contact with the New Rochelle man, Mr. Cuomo said.

The man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, had attended synagogue services before becoming symptomatic.

Public health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.

Also on Saturday, the governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, said a New York doctor who commutes to work at Bridgeport Hospital tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Lamont said the physician did not show visible symptoms while treating patients and isolated himself.

New Jersey officials said four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.

Mr. Cuomo on Saturday did not say how many New Yorkers were now isolating themselves at home over fears they might have been exposed to the virus. But as of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state to self-quarantine.

About 2,300 of that quarantined group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.

In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said the state was aggressively testing as many people as possible.

‚ÄúWe want to find positives,‚Äù the governor said, adding that while some people might be disconcerted by the rising number of patients, it showed that the solid medical detective work was underway. ‚ÄúWe say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs good news, that we know who the people are.‚Äô‚Äù

New York City officials have asked the federal government to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter on Friday that the city‚Äôs limited capacity to test had ‚Äúimpeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.‚Äù

&gt; Corcraft is the ""brand name"" for the Division of Correctional Industries, an entity within the NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Industries uses the manufacturing of products to assist in the department's overall mission to prepare offenders for release through skill development, work ethic, respect and responsibility.

&gt; Corcraft uses a business model to guide decisions and balance costs, market prices and other demands from both the correctional system and non-DOCCS customers. Corcraft is funded through the state budgetary process in conjunction with the passing of the DOCCS agency budget. Corcraft is funded through an Internal Services fund, and the revenue received from the sale of products and services is utilized to cover the expenses associated with operating the program.

On February 3rd, the NY state senate committee on domestic animal welfare voted unanimously in favor of a bill to shut down the ‚Äòpuppy pipeline‚Äô in NY. To keep momentum moving forward, you all should contact your legislators and give your support (or, if you oppose ‚Äì for whatever reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs still good to voice your opinions anyway); this can be done at the provided link or by contacting your state legislators directly. If you don‚Äôt know whose yours is, you can find that information \[here\]( [https://www.nysenate.gov/find-my-senator](https://www.nysenate.gov/find-my-senator)).

With the added support, the bill might be able to passed by the full senate and move in the assembly.

What‚Äôs the puppy pipeline? It‚Äôs the supply chain of animals from out of state breeding mills, trucked for days across state lines, and brought to local stores near you. There‚Äôs a myriad of health problems with many of these animals and where the animals come from don‚Äôt get disclosed to stores. 

Finding the perfect pup (or kitty) to adopt from a shelter is made easy with sites like \[theshelterpetproject.org\]([https://theshelterpetproject.org/](https://theshelterpetproject.org/)), which let you search for breed or age. Most animals come with shots already given, reducing future expenses.

No fucking shit.

* ¬†Schools¬†should conduct regular health checks of students, staff, and visitors;

Schools are closed, Cuomo did this days ago. 

* ¬†Senior living facilities should implement social distancing measures;

Senior living facilities have already implemented measures, closing facilitates to outside visitors and providing extra support to residents. 

* Workplaces should encourage staff to telework and expand sick leave policies

Cuomo said this days ago.

* Community and faith-based organizations should move gatherings of any size to video-accessible venues or postpone/cancel.

Cuomo banned these types of gatherings days ago.

* ¬†Healthcare facilities should implement triage before entering facilities.

This is the only reasonable suggestion, part of the spread in NYC is because of someone showing up without informing the hospital prior and forcing the quarantine of dozens of medical staff.

Trump seems to have a visceral fear of admitting he doesn't know something, and he'll make shit up when he doesn't. (""Only 1 person from China has it"", ""It's a hoax"", ""We have it well under control"", ""Google's got this nationwide website"", ""I alone can fix this"").   Unfortunately it's a stupidly dangerous thing to do.  You can actually see the Dow or Dow Futures go down in real time whenever he's speaking because people have gotten long past the point where they believe him to actively worrying if he himself believes any of the shit he's saying.    It's gotten to the point in Caine Mutiny where he's talking about the count of strawberries and that's scary.

Cuomo and Fauci give me the reassurance that even if they don't know what is coming, they are doing everything in their power to mitigate the issue.

It all depends on what guidance your state is giving to the people making the initial decision. 

When you talk to the UB people do not use the word ""quit"". Dance around that word as much as you can. Say you were forced out because you are pregnant and they could not guarantee a safe environment, for example. (Legally this would be considered a ""[constructive discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_dismissal)"".) **Protect yourself now and get a doctor's note supporting your position.**

2342,WikiTextBot,"**Constructive dismissal**

In employment law, constructive dismissal, also called constructive discharge or constructive termination, occurs when an employee resigns as a result of the employer creating a hostile work environment. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination. For example, when an employer places extraordinary and unreasonable work demands on an employee to obtain their resignation, this can constitute a constructive dismissal.

The exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.

This one Subway worker is afraid he will lose his income because Subway isn't giving paid time off. So he will continue to expose himself on the trains and buses for 4 hours. Because ppl in UWS need Subway sandwiches. Who cares about his family at home? Luckily this is my Uncle and I was able to provide masks and gloves I had at home. I am worried for him. 

My dad works at home Depot. He was the borough park example I used earlier. My dad is 65 and has high blood pressure, so he's considered to be a good candidate to host COVID19. Why is home depot still open and considered to be essential? Home Depot allowed employees 2 weeks PTO. The employee can pick when he starts the PTO at any point. Meaning if you feel uncomfortable you can start taking the 2 weeks or if you're infected you start the 2 weeks. Think about how messed up that is? My dad has barely any vacation or sick days because Payroll year just started. They don't accumulate enough time yet. He told me people were coughing on him. Customers got in his face and told him that they pay his salary so he should find them a freezer. He called me crying yesterday after his shift. He called out sick today, has the day off tomorrow, will be starting the home Depot 2 week leave on Mon. We can't risk our lives at this point. 


Why is this happening? I just can't understand it. If someone is exposed to more than 10 people in a small confined area for more than 2 minutes should automatically assume they are infected. From what I'm witnessing that's just not happening right now in NYC. The numbers are not even at peak yet.

That being said, his handling of the budget isn‚Äôt so good.  The state has a very large deficit and we are already taxed to our knees as it is at like every level.

The weather is a close second as to why we cant stay here.  I have zero use for winter whatsoever and cant stand dealing with it.  Fall is nice for about 2-3 weeks but that just leads into winter.  I think as one ages you have less and less desire for ""seasons"" and would prefer more constant weather like you get further south and west.

It's a socioeconomic problem and he basically put teachers to blame for something out of their control. His speech was not received well especially because his mother was a teacher and the guy never even went to public schools (he also advocates for Charter schools).

2622,chickcat,"I am a police officer in one of the hardest hit areas (I know, Reddit hates cops, save it). Due to my profession I have a bigger personal problem with Cuomo than most. I am one of few left-leaning cops. It‚Äôs just a job to me, I thoroughly enjoy the moments where I‚Äôm able to help someone and avoid making nonsensical arrests. I don‚Äôt believe drug users should be punished. I believe the majority of people who receive public assistance actually need and deserve it. It‚Äôs just the small percentage of abusers making the welfare system appear as a scam. I believe prisoners should have more rights; there‚Äôs no benefit to anyone to keep them under a rock. However I don‚Äôt think the average citizen understands the ramifications of the bail reform laws. From the outside it appears logical, no bail for low-level crimes. It runs much deeper than that. Bail needs to be entirely eradicated. Money shouldn‚Äôt dictate freedom. However, someone tells an 80 year old lady ‚Äúgive me your purse or I‚Äôll punch you in the face,‚Äù they‚Äôre out of jail in an hour. Someone who beats their spouse is out the next day with a majorly useless order of protection. Someone breaks into your home, they‚Äôre out in an hour. And will victimize someone else. With what‚Äôs going on, myself along with underpaid, overworked EMT‚Äôs (hate cops all you want, they are the real MVPs) are getting assaulted, spit on, and literal shit and piss thrown on us more and more. So there are people who have to worry about taking this virus home to their grandmas because shitty humans are able to freely walk the streets. And we can‚Äôt do anything about it. A lot of people joke that cops are lazy when in reality we‚Äôre just fucking burnt out. Believe what you will but most of us signed up to help people. But in the overwhelming majority of cases, we‚Äôre not allowed to. To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt much better before but Cuomo fucked up majorly on this and gave the public a false sense of positive reform.

Biased opinion stated, I immediately recognized that Cuomo is doing an excellent job with this mess. Guy appears to be working around the clock. It‚Äôs admirable that he isn‚Äôt afraid to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù...when the fuck have you ever heard that from a politician? People are criticizing him for waiting too long to shut things down, but I believe it was great timing. Reddit lives in a white collar IT bubble (for the record, I previously worked in IT for over 10 years) and doesn‚Äôt understand there are A LOT of people in NY who rely on retail and service industries for income. They can‚Äôt ‚Äúwork from home.‚Äù Deciding to shut the state down, albeit necessary, is a double-edged sword. A lot of people I know will not survive a shut-down. I‚Äôm very afraid for my local businesses. My husband works in retail and will likely get laid off. Once this passes, I won‚Äôt be too surprised if I get laid off, working in an agency that is already short-staffed.

S8125 (ACTIVE) - SUMMARY
Suspends all rent payments for certain residential tenants and small business commercial tenants if such tenant has lost employment or was forced to close their place of business and certain mortgage payments for landlords of such tenants in the state for ninety days following the effective date of this act in response to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

BILL NUMBER: S8125

SPONSOR: GIANARIS
 &gt;
TITLE OF BILL:
&gt;
An act to suspend rent payments and certain mortgage payments for
certain residential tenants and small business commercial tenants for
ninety days in response to the outbreak of coronavirus
&gt; 
PURPOSE:
&gt;
To waive commercial and residential rent for 90 days for tenants that
have lost employment or been forced to close their place of business as
a result of government ordered restrictions in response to COVID-19, and
waive certain mortgage payments for 90 days for mortgagors who experi-
ence financial hardship due to COVID-19.
&gt; 
SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:
&gt;
Section one waives commercial and residential rent for 90 days for
tenants that have lost employment or been forced to close their place of
business in response to COVID-19, and waives certain mortgage payments
for 90 days in an amount consistent with any lost rent for anyone expe-
riencing financial hardship due to the virus.
&gt;
Section two defines residential and commercial tenants, covered proper-
ty, and small business. Section three sets the effective date.
&gt; 
EXISTING LAW:
&gt; 
JUSTIFICATION:
&gt;
With non-essential businesses shutting down in New York State to prevent
the spread of COVID-19, workers and employers alike will face difficult
economic times. Businesses across the state are forced to lay off
employees or shut down their businesses due to an inability to afford
their numerous expenses. These tenants should not be held responsible
for paying money into rent while their income is being interrupted by
this pandemic.  Additionally, mortgagors experiencing financial hard-
ships because of the virus should also receive relief All New Yorkers
are sacrificing as a result of this crisis and government must do what
it can to help. It would be harmful to our entire society to expect
tenants without income to continue to take on financial liabilities.

We took drastic preventative measures 2 weeks ago when we only had a dozen or so confirmed cases (but we just had our March break end so there was a huge influx of residents from infected places). Was the smart thing to do.

Seems to me the sentiment is similar to what happened in Italy where residents didn‚Äôt care and/or businesses didn‚Äôt even provide the work from home option.

2829,itouchabutt,"We ARE flattening the curve, but the US is part of the handful of countries who simply aren't doing it aggressively enough, so we are shrinking the r-nought value, but not nearly as much as we could.  By having leaky quarantines and an inconsistent message across the country, we are delaying the inflection point people are hoping to see.  We are slowing the rate of actual growth, just not enough to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed, and honestly we were too late anyway.  I was expecting worse by now, and still expect much worse over the next two weeks.  You do need to realize though that the effect of our current quarantines are time-delayed--you won't see R-nought values drop for 2-3 weeks AFTER real quarantine has been instated.  You can't trust Americans to voluntarily do the right thing, look at Florida, in general.

The rate of spread was expected to accelerate, we knew the disease was spreading rapidly a month ago, and we knew that we're chasing the disease with testing rather than staying ahead of it.  I knew that, and I'm not an epidemiologist, I just did some really basic graphs, researched some data on hospital capacity, and immediately warned everyone I knew that quarantine was inevitable.  We also knew hospitals would be overwhelmed.  I told all my closest friends the timelines the data predicted, and they're pretty much on point--reported cases are still way below actual.  You can also do a reverse analysis on the infection rates based on mortality and see that of course the reported numbers aren't accurate.  I got the virus in mid-January in rural Vermont, and just brushed it off as a severe flu until I started doing some back of napkin math and realized LOTS of people probably had it.

We also knew that for every 1% of global unemployment, 40,000 people die just from the direct effects of poverty, and to do a proper quarantine we'd bench at least a 1/3rd of our country's workforce and send the world into a global depression that could last years.  Trump is a complete moron and doesn't really get it, but people around him were obligated to explain that the cure is also not without inevitable deaths.  He's on the bargaining stage of the Kubler-Ross scale, I think.  He certainly passed denial and anger. I don't envy anyone making that sort of decision, but I also wouldn't give the responsibility to a narcissistic megalomaniac with hate in his heart.  

The only way we could have prevented this was a shelter at home order in January, and back then only a few senators, virologists, epidemiologists, pentagon officials, and people who were following the messages (in pinyin) from chinese scientists.  You won't get bold actions from senators just based on intel unless they are an idealist, and let's be honest, most of them aren't.

I'm not going to forgive all the foolishness from the top, nor will I forgive any of the republican fools who are going to wait to give shelter-in-place orders.  The US Government was effectively briefed on this, but with people like McConnell in place you can't expect the senate to do anything just, decent, good, or practical.  

There is a reason the french revolution involved a lot of rich people's heads in buckets.  I'm hoping this is an opportunity for a social revolution.  If not, I'm hoping this disease runs like wildfire through old politicians.",1585171427,flhxn8c

This isn't a hostage/war scenario... And again, we're not looking to nationalize, we're looking to recommons and collectivize.

It starts with abandoned properties, because that's what we can acquire now. Slowly we build better alternatives... Demand for high-rise apartment space or incredibly over-priced apartments in general decreases if free or cheaper housing is available. It slowly becomes no longer profitable to lord over people that need housing. By transforming those abandoned properties in to cheaper alternatives, or acquiring properties which are not abandoned and then distributing them to collectives, not for profits, or to families which can maintain them, making them tax free (because the state does not own the land, and the benefit for having people in the city, as a part of the economy is positive enough), then the profit driven justification for owning those high-rise buildings and milking citizens will slowly become less tenable. Landlords cannot afford to maintain their properties, they need to sell them, and then as municipalities can afford them they buy and recommons...

Look at Syracuse and their abandoned properties... http://www.syrgov.net/VacantRegistry.aspx Who is living in those houses, and who is buying these?

That **3,500** number was deemed **illegal** by the courts and the governor's office hasn't responded with executive action or asked the legislature to respond. It's totally plausible that Cuomo **intends to keep Independents off the ballot** using COVID as a screen.

/u/_____no____ isn't going to accept anything other than orang man not good and cuomo is a saint and anything else is just ""cherrypicked"" because the media always gets a free pass

They would never admit Trump handled this perfectly, from shutting down transportation early, to enlisting the private sector to ramp up medical supply production, to providing stimulus, and urging everybody to keep calm so that the response isn't worse than the virus itself. 

And he was hamstringed from the beginning with all our supply chains in China, something he inherited and has criticized literal decades ago

Trump called the hysteria about the virus a ""hoax"", right? You're now saying there was no hysteria about the virus and both liberal and conservative media was downplaying it... so what was he calling a hoax exactly?

You're defeating your own goddamn argument without realizing it because you're an idiot.

3392,AFloppyZipper,"&gt; what I said was SCIENTISTS AND MEDICAL EXPERTS were warning the country...

Not really. It was the same as always. Opinions were all over the place. There was absolutely no real consensus because at the time all you had was unreliable Chinese data.

Some ""scientists and medical experts"" thought it would be easier than the flu, some thought it would be slightly worse, and some were alarmist and some hyperalarmist. 

Conflating ""don't panic"" with ""telling the country the virus was contained"" is a poor argument. He shut down flights early and once we had more data effectively shut down the country's economy. He released FDA shackles and we now have a treatment/therapeutic and many areas other than shittily-managed urban shitholes don't have any real tangible problem.

You're trying to have your cake and eat it too, and it doesn't work that way.

None of this matters. The president of the United States told every American citizen that the virus was ""contained"" when we had less than 100 cases... we now have 175,000 cases.

Both Democrats and Republicans are about as close as you can possibly get to the center of the political spectrum. ""Far right"" would be people like Hitler, ""far left"" would be more along the lines of Stalin.

It's important to remember in these trying times that people you disagree with, including politically, are still people like you and I.

The previous year, state Democrats had taken advantage of their newfound control of both chambers of the legislature to pass landmark criminal justice reforms that went into effect in January, eliminating cash bail in most instances and ending a long-standing arrangement that allowed prosecutors to withhold their evidence against defendants virtually until the day of their trials.

Cuomo signed the legislation last year, but made it clear he didn‚Äôt like it, and set about trying to roll it back this year ‚Äî threatening to put more people in jails even as they are ravaged by the novel coronavirus. Rather than asking the legislature to consider changes in open floor debate, he stuffed his criminal justice agenda into the secretive budget process, where legislators would get virtually no chance to even review the changes to the law, much less discuss them before voting on them.

In typical hardball fashion, Cuomo‚Äôs opening bid was a reformers‚Äô worst nightmare. His draft legislation proposed to give judges the power ‚Äî unprecedented in state history ‚Äî to jail defendants, even people facing misdemeanor charges, on the basis of a premonition that those defendants might commit some future act of violence. The same judges who have spent decades using money bail to incarcerate New Yorkers before their trials would now be handed the power to lock people up based on their powers of divination, the reading of entrails, or the huffing of oracular vapors.

Once they are down in NYC and put in use, they will stay in use. If our hospital loans 5 ventilators, they won't be just sitting around in NYC but will be hooked up to 5 patients.  What are they going to do when we ask for them back, unhook the patients?   I can imagine the uproar if they wheeled those loaned ventilators, past people who desperately need them,  out of NYC hospitals to ship back upstate.  

There would also be an uproar here when the cases rise higher, when we have many more patients than ventilators, people are dying for the lack of them and it comes out that we had more but they were taken away.    

Getting paid for the loaned ventilators would be cold comfort. It's not like you can run over to the ventilator big box store and pick up another one.  And it's not like we have the luxury of time, the numbers are rising fast.

I get it - everyone is desperate.   We in upstate watch what's going on in NYC, look at our projections and say ""holy shit.""  

It's like the sinking of the Titanic.  Person A in the water asks Person B high on the upturned end of the ship for his life preserver since he isn't using it at the moment and promises he'll give it back when asked.  Person B is watching the ship slipping down and knows he's going to be in the water within a couple minutes.  They both want to live.  It makes perfect sense that Person A will say anything to get a life preserver and is highly unlikely to give it back.  It makes perfect sense that Person B knows this and holds on even more tightly.

I don‚Äôt think most reasonable people would be opposed to sending almost all available PPE and other non-durable and easy to acquire items to Downstate as quickly as possible, I imagine you‚Äôd find quite a few people/organizations would volunteer to assist in the effort. I believe the problem is that items like ventilators are expensive complex items, that are not easily replaced. Sort of work around would be to talk to Heath Care Managers and Medical Logistics professionals. Ask them to compile the data on how many vents are used on a regular basis, then factor in best- and worst-case scenarios based on similar sized population densities. Only then send the additional capacity to support downstate. Another way, or even an additional step would be to count vents by county or municipality and not by facility. But to pit one geographical location against another, is both irresponsible and dangerous. The Governor really needs to hold a press conference about his statement regarding this and the use of the NY National Guard (NG) to enforce/expedite this action. 
My next issue with this situation, and over the past several hours different explanations have been given. Is the NG going to be used strictly to gather and transport or is seizure and confiscation their purpose? This question gets even muddier, if the answer is seizure and confiscation, where will it stop? The use of the NG in this capacity, is well within the rights of a States Executive, but is it the best use? Add this to the confusion created by a certain Mayor claiming the NG is not the military creates confusion. The Governor needs to sit with all these high-profile leaders and hold a sync as to what these resources are and aren‚Äôt, so they can let the constituencies know what they do and clear up confusion.

4123,Louis_Farizee,"Most cemeteries are built on shitty land that isn‚Äôt good for much else, though. You‚Äôre acting like 110 acres of unused space is hard to come by, when there are thousands and thousands of acres of land that nobody wants in New York State alone. 

I‚Äôm also struggling to understand what you mean by ‚Äúbutcher stone‚Äù.",1586199930,fmm6z1u
4124,lnvalidEmailAddress,"We extract tons of stone to make grave markers.

I'm not acting as though this land is hard to come by. There is plenty of open space in New York, for sure. But that space isn't just ""open"" it's contemporary ecosystems. To destroy those systems, and remove the possibility of using that land for any other purpose except putting wooden boxes which aren't biodegradable, and butchered stones that will be there forever, is asinine. Destroying the ecosystem in the first place is asinine, but I digress.",1586200400,fmm7uf5

These would be temporary burials.",1586200978,fmm8xmi

There are plenty of cemeteries that are still functional, and they all could support the collective body-mass of everyone who dies in New York from this. 

My point is this is an opportunity to actually make some positive changes in our burial practices. We could spare those plots and spare some land.",1586201302,fmm9jx5
4129,lnvalidEmailAddress,"I did read the article; I think you'll read that I mention the fact that the carbon emitted from temporarily burying, and then exhumeing and redistributing corpses isn't accounted for in the carbon calculation if you had read the entire comment (which I'm assuming, as you did for me, that you did not).

I'm suggesting that these *shouldn't be* temporary burials, and we create a mass grave in the form of a memorial forest.",1586201390,fmm9q3s
