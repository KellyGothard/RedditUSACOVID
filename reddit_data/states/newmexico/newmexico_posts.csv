**When**: Weds Jan 8 at 1pm ET

**More info**: As the climate crisis intensifies and federal inaction remains, governors across the nation are taking matters into their own hands. A bipartisan coalition of 25 governors, known as the U.S. Climate Alliance, have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  **Minnesota Governor Tim Walz**, **New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham,** and **Hawaii Governor David Ige** are three governors who have prioritized climate action since coming into office. 

Join us for a webinar on gubernatorial action on climate change, featuring the executive-branch officials leading climate efforts. From Minnesota, Environmental Quality Board Executive Director **Will Seuffert** will speak on the state’s recent executive order to create a Subcabinet on Climate Change. Representing New Mexico, Sustainability and Resilience Officer **Laura Tabor** and Environmental Protections Director **Sandra Ely** will discuss the state’s recent emission-reduction recommendations, which evaluates the adoption of an economy-wide cap-and-trade program. From Hawaii, **Anukriti Hittle**, who helps lead Hawaii’s climate change mitigation and adaptation work at the Department of Land and Natural Resources, will discuss some of the state’s recent initiatives. From Maryland, Department of Environment Secretary **Ben Grumbles** will provide an overview of what the state is currently doing to address the climate crisis. This critical and candid conversation will dive into what three states are currently working on, and what the future may hold.",NewMexico,Upcoming Webinar: Governors Leading on Climate Action

I went to MVD to get DL and was told I’d have to take a DWI test online before being allowed to get a NM DL and i would also have to take a written and driving test even though I have an out of state license. The DWI test they said was because I’m under the age of 25 and they recommend I wait until I am 25 to get a DL..... I researched online and did not see these requirements they asked me for so I’m wondering if it’s correct. MVD lady also had to ask her partner if I needed to and she said yes, so it makes me feel like maybe they’re not all up to date on correct policy.

We’re coming from east Texas so I thought we’d hop on Route 66 and head towards Albuquerque. We plan on camping some and staying in hotels/motels.

I’d like to make a big loop so we can visit Albuquerque, Taos, Santa Fe, and then head south to see White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Roswell before heading back to Texas. No concrete plans yet, and I’m open to straying out further west. I’ve got some guide books and brochures from the state travel bureau and it looks like they’re aren’t any festivals happening while we’re going to be there. 

We’re all history nerds and would like to see interesting Native American sites and cool geological sites. My kiddo wants to see everything Billy the Kid related and wants to fish. We want to visit a reservation too. We also want to eat everything.

To our God of trust, we come from our different paths of faith and prayer but let us all know that peace and common understanding are the guide for us on this earth. In this our land of beauty and enchantment, may we honor and respect the dignity of each person and accept that each of us exists in the other. May we understand that hatred of the one who is different has no place in the world that can be.

Help us to overcome the suffering and hopelessness that come with hatred and violence. May we honor each other and find the commonness of will in our differences. As our religious beliefs exhort us to tolerance and living together in peace, help each of us to make this true, creating harmony in our own spiritual path, as we respect the other.

Give us guidance and clarity to think in the oneness that we are as a people and surpass the divisiveness that also exists within us. May we honor the best that we are, our godliness within.

May the leadership and the members of this New Mexico House of Representatives give direction to our citizens with a light to the path of wholeness and well-being, creating a better life for all of us who live in this beloved land.

In Hebrew we ask for “Tikkun Olam”, to heal the world. Guide us and our legislators to heal our land of injustice and inequality, may each of us be part of creating a better world. We ask for wisdom and good judgment, justice and grace. When we are gone, may people be able to say that our memory has been a blessing. Guide us as we ask for peace, paz, shalom, salaam, hózhǫ́.

173,SelectWalksA,1580581138,exa8jf,Nan,"If you are in the process of getting licensed in the state of NM you may be aware that starting September 2020 NM is moving from the NES for teacher licensure to the Praxis for teacher licensure. For the next eight months, however, aspiring teachers have their choice; they can take either set of tests.

[https://webnew.ped.state.nm.us/bureaus/licensure/how-to-apply/](https://webnew.ped.state.nm.us/bureaus/licensure/how-to-apply/)

For those who plan on beginning their journey into teaching this year the answer is straightforward: you should take the Praxis because that is the future. You won't be able to take all your licensure tests in the beginning anyway, so you might as well stick with one set of tests.  For those in the middle of the licensure process, i.e currently in school, the answer isn't as obvious as to which set you should take. Should you stick to the NES or switch to the Praxis? So I thought I would compare them.

Here's the raw data. I did this for elementary ed but secondary should be similar. 

Praxis: #5622 $146 SR/CR 120 minutes 70 SR, 4 CR questions; 5205 $146 SR/CR 150  90 SR, 3 CR; 5017 $120 SR 130 minutes 120 questions

Totals: $412 400 minutes 280 question SR, 7 CR 1.4 minutes per question. 

NES: #NT051 $95 180 Minutes 100 SR, 1 case study, 1 work product; #NT 102, #103 $95 195 minutes 150 SR; NT 104 $95 180 minutes 150 SR

Totals: $285 555 minutes 400 SR, 1 case study, 1 work product. 1.4 minutes per question.

First, it is worth noting that the average time per question between the two set of tests is very similar and rounds up to 1.4 minutes per question. The advantage of the NES is that it costs $127 less than the Praxis but requires an additional 155 minutes to answer an addition 120 extra SR questions. The NES also splits the teaching and learning test into two sub tests, so if you fail one you can take it without taking the whole test again.

Second, I tried to see if the tests were measuring the same thing is roughly, yes. The NES because it has more questions is more detailed but the topics covered while not identical appear similar. 

Third, I looked at study materials. I thought this favored the Praxis but this depends on how you study. Overall, I thought the Praxis offered a wider range of free material for the independent learner and the quality of prep material seemed to be overall higher. I recognize that this is a subjective assessment.

Fourth is the test difficulty. Here I had a difficult time making an assessment because I hadn't taken the Praxis. The Praxis seemed easier when I looked at the practice questions but there were so few I have low confidence in that assessment because of the small sample size. 

Conclusion: if one is on a tight budget or your confidence is low and you think you may need to retake a test, it is better to go with the NES. It's longer but the financial stakes are less. Having to spend $150 to repeatedly take a Praxis test is going to get old fast. Overall the Praxis is much more ""higher stakes"" testing. If we think about how much we are paying to answer each question the Praxis is charging $1.43 per question and the NES 70 cents. On the other hand if time is a factor, the Praxis requires 2.5 hours less testing. 

For myself, I decided to switch to the Praxis. It is more expensive but it seemed easier, takes less time, and seemed to have better prep materials. The downside is that if I am wrong it is going to be an expensive mistake. 

Oh, I should add one final note. One thing you will need to consider is testing center locations. At this time there are only a handful of Praxis testing centers in NM while the NES has many more. For example, if you are in Las Vegas you will need to take the Praxis in Santa Fe but the NES can be taken at Highlands. So that is something to consider too. You also will need to look at testing dates, since the different tests are offered on different dates and times.",NewMexico,Testing advice for aspiring NM teachers

Hagerman - 1/5
Boring small town (population less than 1,300) with nothing to do and just country as hell. Town literally has like 2 small grocery stores and that's about it. One of those ""elementary/middle/high school is all in the same place"" type towns and their kid's sporting events are literally all they have going on for entertainment. Well, that and I'm sure substance abuse. Lol

Roswell - 2.5/5
A definite step up from Hagerman, but what a shit town. Not much else to do there but go to the small ass mall and look at alien shit. The crime is pretty bad there too and it's just boring landscape. The people have shitty attitudes as well.

Alamogordo - 3/5
Ok, so this town is smaller than Roswell and has an even shittier mall, less to do, and a meth problem, so why would I rank it higher than Roswell? I LOVE METH HEH-HEUGHHH!!!! No, but really, despite that the people in general are friendlier than in Roswell and the landscape/mountains so close to the town make it a nicer place to live imo as far as small ass towns go. It's also close to Cloudcroft and Ruidoso which are nice little getaways. It's still not a place I'd want to live in forever, far from it.

Las Cruces - 4/5
I like Cruces obviously reflected in my rating. It's honestly one of the better places to live in NM imo and is leagues better than places I've lived in or passed through. It's a decent sized city, not too big not too small, people are decent enough, there is a bit more to do, NMSU is a great university, and it's got a pretty decent landscape as well as a mountain backdrop i.e. the Organ mountains. I also love how close it is to El Paso as I also love El Paso. If I had to live in one place in NM for the rest of my life, I'd choose LC 9 times out of 10.


---


Honorable mentions

Figured I'd mention the other places I've been but never lived. I won't rate them because I've never lived in them, but I have visited them numerous times, on occasion staying a few days at a time at many of them.

Ruidoso - Obviously a very beautiful place up in the mountains, casino gambling, seasonal horse racing, skiing in the winter, etc... What's not to like? Apparently however, many of the people who live there have substance abuse issues as well as just not wanting to work despite the high cost of living. That's what I've heard anyway... I've only ever gone there for gambling, or to work (often times helping out stores who are always short staffed and/or have flakey ass employees).

We also think we would be happier in Las Cruces since there seems to be more to do there. We’re from Southern California and enjoy a larger town feel.

I don't like where I live because the cost of living is higher than other parts of the state. It is very safe but it is growing rapidly and I just feel unhappy here. The infrastructure can't handle all the people anymore. It seriously takes 20 mins to drive 2 miles some days. I don't understand why people want to live here. There isn't much to do, all the restaurants are garbage, and the lack of sun makes it hard for me to be positive and productive outside my apartment. I also dislike the area because it is cold over 3/4 of the year and the winters can be long and brutal. I love to do outdoor activities but it is too cold and wet most of the year and in the summer there are a lot of tourists clogging up the hiking trails and lake. Basically, I gotta get out ASAP and I am interested in NM.

I am currently in school to become an aircraft mechanic. I am interested in moving to New Mexico when I have my A&amp;P licenses but I have never been there. My S/O works for USPS and hopefully he would be able to transfer. All of the pictures look beautiful. I love the desert and warmth/sunshine, sand, cacti, etc. I am thinking of Las Cruces because of my interest in working for Virgin Galactic but I am open to anywhere that doesn't get a ton of snow and has sunshine most of the year. It seems like aviation/aerospace careers would be big in NM.

I have never lived in a huge city and I would prefer a place that has less than 100,000 people, is spread out well and not congested, and doesn't have insane traffic. Ideal temperatures would be 40s to 90s. I would also want to go hiking and exploring, maybe bike and fish occasionally. We have a small dog and I feel bad that I can't do much with him here. He loves to be outside when it's warm and sunny. Safety is a plus but we don't want children so it doesn't need to be a super family-oriented place.

They are so proud when they learn basic life lessons like hey be there for your kid and don't gang bang while the rest of us figured that out as kids.

As far as Mayor Alan Webber's administration is concerned, it's none of your business whether a police officer—or any other city employee for that matter—has been disciplined for misconduct. From police officers shooting residents to someone stealing from the business office, the public is in the dark when the Santa Fe investigates its own and decides someone has broken the rules.

The administration believes that the fact of police and other employee discipline should be kept secret, and is not a fact at all. Rather, the city of Santa Fe claims that any such discipline is a matter of opinion.

The Santa Fe Reporter has been asking for disciplinary records for years, in particular about police officers. The city has denied us each time. So, last year, we sued them under IPRA.

I've built out a site that offers Free Listings for New Mexico Artisans, Trades People, Places, Events, etc.

It is not for Garage Sale type listings. It will allow folks to advertise their work, post help wanted ads, and so on. With many features, 

including an image gallery, personal contact form, videos, booking calendar, and more. It also offers a ""Trading Post"" where folks can offer 

their products for sale, and all payments will go directly to the Vendor.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I will be developing a section for New Mexico History and Culture. So, anyone willing to provide content, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

You will need to register with a valid email - this is to prevent spambots from posting - and I promise no SPAM; I will not pester you with 

emails of any sort.

&amp;#x200B;

All listings will be reviewed prior to acceptance. Keeping in mind the site is Rated ""G"". Not ""PG"", not ""R"", etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Ignore any reference to costs; there will be none. You will be taken to Checkout, but there won't be a way to pay :-)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who helps by beta testing and wishes to have an actual listing once we go live, will be offered special free listing plans of their 

choice for taking the time to help work out the kinks. The only feature at this point that would be extra cost is the ability to have a 

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. feed on your listing. Although, there are demo's of the Facebook feed on the site.

Any Facebook feed would need to be public and have the full path: i.e ""[https://www.facebook.com/NewMexicoUTD](https://www.facebook.com/NewMexicoUTD)""

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like beta testers to do: 

&amp;#x200B;

Add Listings, listings, listings. Then using the Contact form, (or click on the little gold bug) and let me know the good, the bad and the 

ugly.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, the listings currently appearing on the site are examples only and any Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and 

incidents are either the products of the author's imagination or used in a fictitious manner.

&amp;#x200B;

If this post is approved, Thank You Admins!

No reason to be uneducated in this day in age if you can get a library card. 

I use to ditch school to go to a book store. I left the Catholic Church at 14 after I found books that showed a different side of things. 

We need to build the world we want ourselves but it's going to take a rejection of our obsession with the past. Being here for 400 years is not a accomplishment. If it is the Native Americans have us beat anyways. 

We will need to reject gang culture. It is a nowhere road that weighs all the innocent people around it down.

We need to reject cocaine and heroin. 

We need to build, experiment, innovate

If we don't we will keep having this brain drain where people leave for a much better world.

We need to stop looking to the government for answers. The government could care less about us. We need to do it ourselves. 

We live in the first world. There is no need for a place called the warzone in ABQ. 

We are placing the gun to our head and blaming everyone else.

My coworker got a call on her cell phone about 30 minutes ago. A woman that sounded like her daughter gets on the phone first saying ""Mom help me"" or something to that effect. A man then got on the phone saying he had kidnapped the woman. They then tried to get my coworker to meet them somewhere. Thankfully at this point my boss had called her and told her it was a scam per the 911 operator.

I want everyone to know this is happening right now and DO NOT meet these scammers anywhere. CALL YOUR CHILD and ensure they are safe, then call the cops and report the incident.

Despite 6 being killed yesterday, 6 more are already on the chopping block. If you're interested please reach out through Facebook to this rescue group. They are amazing and will help guide you on what you can do to save a Roswell dog's life. 

The community can't handle yet another day of sadness, if you can share this with anyone interested in adopting a dog or if you yourself is interested, please go get one of these guys ASAP. 

We have a #roswellsurvivor ourselves and he is the BEST boy. He was hours away from death before we rescued him and we're just shocked that no one wanted this guy. He's incredible. 

Please help these guys out, you can make today one of shocking happiness if they suddenly get a burst of people adopting and clearing out the shelter!

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

As a long distance cyclist this has happened to me exactly once.  The truck pulled up along side and belched it's smoke into my face.  Didn't bother me that much because cycling is a tough sport.  In Missouri I've been spit on, had things thrown at me.  Once a car load of teenage girls came up on me and slapped me on the arse and I can't say I didn't enjoy it!  New Mexico is generally much more chill in it's attitude towards cyclists than Missouri.  

So it was very gratifying to hear about this:

*The stars of Discovery Channel's Diesel Brothers television show are being ordered to pay $851,451 for their role in producing and selling modified diesel pickups that wreaked environmental havoc in the state of Utah. David ""Heavy D"" Sparks, Joshua Stuart, Keaton Hoskins, and Dave Kiley—a.k.a. ""Diesel Dave""—were the targets of a case that reached a federal judge after being initiated by Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment.*

They may also be on the hook for $1.2 mil in attorneys fees.  So, good.  I hope it bankrupts them.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

I've been wanting to take a trip to the US for quite some time now. Not sure where, I always thought NYC will be the first choice but I'm starting to be fascinated with the desert-like areas in the US. 

This week I've been watching this show on Netflix called Chambers, it takes places in Arizona I think but it was filmed in New Mexico. I find the scenery breath-taking and I'm very curious about the culture too. 

To put it briefly, I would be interested in your opinions on if I should do this, what to expect, how to prepare and of course, what should I see.

527,joez37,1584990740,fnpwld,Nan,"&gt;Things you could say to your friends:  
&gt;  
&gt;The  virus is spreading through us like wildfire. It will kill hundreds if  not thousands every day. Can you imagine a terrorist attack a day  killing 500 people for weeks on end? If you could help stop it, would  you?  
&gt;  
&gt;If there's a bit more time to  explain, then maybe tell them that even if you are young, you are still  at risk. You may have a horrible illness, you may end up in ICU on a  ventilator, you might die.  
&gt;  
&gt;But maybe you will be one of the lucky ones and get mild symptoms only. Maybe you have it now and don't know it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Well  - consider someone like you who does have it. You feel fine. You think  ""Hey, this is OK, I'm going to go out and socialise, what's the harm?"".  Every-time you go out, you will pass these virus particles onto other  people, even if you are careful. You have it on your hands, on your  clothes. You touch a surface or open a door? You'll leave virus there  for days for other people to pick up. And suddenly two or three more  people have the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Maybe they  are lucky too and don't get much in the way of symptoms, and maybe one  of them thinks ""hey, this is OK, I'm going to go out as well, what's the  harm?"". And then they also spread it.  
&gt;  
&gt;And  one or two transmissions down the line, someone who is vulnerable, or  just unlucky, maybe your mother or your grandfather, will get it and  need a ventilator or die.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not  about protecting yourself, it's about protecting everyone in the  population. And these measures only work if EVERYONE chips in and does  them.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are used to reading  about catastophe in other places in the world. You might think it's like  a film, or sometimes entertainment. Well, this is not that - this is  happening to you. Right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  will take sacrifice, but really not that much. How spoilt are you to  think that you are entitled to have a beer, or a picnic, or a trip to  the countryside, or a lie down on the beach, or to have a party with  some mates? How pampered and dependent on luxury are you? It is NOT a  right.  
&gt;  
&gt;People in developing  countries have had it much, much worse. Some have isolated and starved  to death under a lock-down. They have died in droves because they have  no healthcare facilities. Elderly and even middle-aged patients in Italy  have been refusing ventilators so they will be available to younger  patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;You don't know how good you have it - don't throw it away.

601,MrKrispyToo,1585525197,frfx23,Nan,"In 1918, Gunnison began a strict quarantine against the world, including having train passengers who disembarked quarantined,  erecting barricades and fences on all main highways near the county lines to prevent entry without submitting to quarantine.  ""Any person may leave the county at his will; none may return except those who will go into voluntary quarantine"" said  Dr FP Hanson, the county physician, who took a leading role.

Perhaps New Mexico should consider having State police on the highways leading in to our state, and at our airports,  to ensure that those who are entering go into strict quarantine.

Instead of face masks and anti-bacterial hand gels, Gunnsion relied on  the guidance and authority of local newspapers, doctors and police – a  trust in institutions that may now seem quaint – and on people’s  capacity for patience. And on luck.

Gunnison’s management of the influenza situation, one hallmarked by the  application of protective sequestration (Social Distancing) is particularly impressive when  one considers that nearly every nearby town and county was severely  affected by the pandemic.

The small but formidable predator called *Dineobellator* would have stalked these open floodplains 70 million years ago.   
&gt;  
&gt;....These rare fossils have features that suggest raptors were still trying out new ways to compete even during the dinosaurs’ last stand—the era just before the extinction event that wiped them out[ 66 million years ago](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact-chicxulub-crater-timeline-destruction-180973075/). “This group was still evolving, testing out new evolutionary pathways, right at the very end before we lost them,” Jasinski notes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The bones from this new specimen bear the scars of a combative lifestyle and suggest some unusual adaptations of tail and claw that might have helped *Dineobellator* *notohesperus* hunt and kill. The name *Dineobellator* pays homage to the dino’s tenacity and that of the local Native American people. *Diné* means ‘the Navajo people,’ while *bellator* is the Latin word for warrior.

**Why are we social distancing, and how long do we have to do that?**

There is a simple way to look at this. There are 3 groups of people. Susceptibles (most of us), Infectious, Recovered. A disease can stop by simply infecting all susceptibles, and it will finish with all the survivors being immune to this year’s model.

That is a disastrous approach, though. Almost everyone will be sick in 6 week period, and the health care system will suffer a crushing defeat. People are badly affected by that.

Social distancing seems like it lasts forever, though. How can we know when things are really improving? 

Well, it’s not very complicated. People who RECOVER from the disease are removed from the infectious group. For the corner to be turned, MORE PEOPLE MUST RECOVER every day THAN NEW CASES. It’s that simple. That starts to lower the infectious population.

But how many people are recovering ?     If the disease lasts 12 days, then the number of new cases 12 days ago are the number of people who recover today. *So we will turn the corner exactly when the number of new cases twelve days ago starts to exceed today’s new cases.*

For New Mexicans, that’s about one more month of good work like you’ve been doing. We can possibly start turning the corner in 5-7 days if new cases stay steady.",NewMexico,How many new cases 12 days ago?

You can eat almost nothing,

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap
