Taking the ferry to Block Island is also a fun day trip- you can rent bikes and ride pretty much around the whole island in a half day, though that might be less feasible if you have a bunch of small kids. Or rent some kayaks and paddle on one of the salt ponds.

For restaurants, Matunuck Oyster Bar is the best for a bit of a splurge dinner, but unless things have changed recently they don‚Äôt take reservations during the summer (though for a party of 12 they might-you‚Äôd have to ask) and it‚Äôs extremely popular so be prepared for a long wait.

Ok what I‚Äôm about to say isn‚Äôt a attack on African Americans, it‚Äôs got nothing to do with race, genetics, and isn‚Äôt any type of eugenics bullshit. Rather they are disproportionately affected by poverty which breeds desperation, violence ect.

That being said, they do commit 53% of all firearm Homicides, they and Hispanics make up nearly 80% of population involved in gangs, African Americans at 35% and Hispanics at 45%. 

1. We need to crack down on gangs like we did with the mob.
2. We need to dramatically increase funding to intercity schools. 
3. Contraception, sex education, and (even though I‚Äôm not a fan of it, abortion) need to be available.
4. The breakdown down of African American families (specifically fathers leaving) is a epidemic which increases the risk of children growing up and being involved in crime.
5. We need to allow a path for illegal aliens to become de facto 2nd class citizens. Restrict some of the typical privileges of us citizens ship, however those living here will be allowed to stay unpursued by I.C.E. with the stipulation after 20 years they will be given full citizenship. (Their children would be born with full citizenship as always). However we would viciously come after everyone who wasn‚Äôt already in the country under that exemption.

6. Reform the immigration system. As I said, we should issue clemency to illegals already in the country, and we should viscously prosecute any further visa overstays, ect. However on the flip side, we have to streamline the immigration process. It needs to be easier to properly immigrate so not a brick wall. Unless your Native American, everyone here is ancestors immigrant (mine included I‚Äôm Italian). For those in immediate danger/claiming asylum, we could stimulate the Puerto Rican economy by using it as a jumping off point while paperwork is getting processed. 

7. Acceptable losses go both ways, if 85% of people using welfare actually need it, and 15% are being lazy asses and abusing it, we shouldn‚Äôt cut it, because of the 85% who genuinely need it.

8. Tax increases may be necessary however in the long run would pay dividends in public service quality available roads, Heathcare ect.

9. The government needs to fear the people, and jury nullification needs to be recognized as a right.

10.  If and this is a BIG if... as a last resort we still can‚Äôt solve our differences even after putting significant effort in, perhaps the Balkanization of the country should be considered to avoid civil war.

Other 1st world countries do have a more balanced approach to how they subsidize populations to help them succeed. Many countries provide financial support to young people to help them get a leg-up in life. Low-cost or free universities, low-cost or free medical coverage, subsidies to defray the costs of daycare for young parents. Here in the US, we do seem to provide for seniors a bit disproportionately. They get tax-free Social Security money, Medicare, house tax discounts. And we'd be naive to not acknowledge that many of those programs exist because seniors vote, and politicians want those votes.

That being said, I applaud your empathy for seniors, OmnipotentProvidence. It's evident to me that you care deeply about the care of our elders.

TL;DR No one wants the job. Anyone who took it would be greatly shunned in the various unions and communities they are apart of. Any proper candidate probably turned down this position as the unions were probably shunning someone.  

Also always look into these ""criminal""  and disciplinary issues / accusations. And I mean look DEEP. Most of the time they were political posturing and only occurred because the person did NOT play the political game and thus is actually a good candidate.  

I am not saying THAT guy is some beacon of goodness or anything. I have not looked into him specifically yet. (for all i know he really is not someone we want in that position.) I am speaking generally.  

I can tell you with 100% confidence that in a union, in fire/police, in government. The person with those kinds of things hanging over their heads are usually because they refuse to play the political games. And thus the various unions and politicians try to get their name smeared.  

Anyone high up with a clean record is someone who should be feared. Cause it probably means they played the game well.

414,lelekfalo,"I did what you're thinking of doing! 

Coming from Chitown, I find RI a pretty damn pleasant place. The whole state is smaller than Chicagoland, and with the commute you're used to, you'll have no issue being willing to explore everything RI has to offer.

The first thing I noticed was the food. All of the food here is good, and a lot of it comes from local or regional producers. Like, it just *does.* You don't have to find a natural organic grocer on the Northside and pay double for potatoes grown a town over. They just end up in grocery stores around here mixed in with everything else. It's pretty cool. And ""farm-to-table"" restaurants are all over... and again, it's just more par-for-the-course. In Chicago, it's a marketing tagline you're paying extra for.

The other thing I noticed was how much happier everyone is here. Everyone always gives New Englanders shit for being grumpy, but I think another commenter explained it pretty well here. People aren't assholes here, but no one is going to pretend to be your best friend in the grocery checkout line. There is a very polite ""live and let live"" mentality here, while still calling out people on their bullshit when necessary. 

In Chicago, people are *miserable.* People behind the counter at the gas station act like they are entirely inconvenienced by *existence.* Yeah, you'll find friendly people here and there, but there is this underlying depression affecting Chicago (especially on the Southside) that I didn't fully recognize until I moved away. RI doesn't have that miserable underbelly. Yeah, there are ""poorer"" parts, but there are no Englewoods or Lawndales here. Yeah it's got a reputation for being the most ""corrupt"" of the New England states, but it ain't shit compared to the Chicago Machine.

If you're familiar with the Loop and surrounding neighborhoods, I'd focus on the neighborhoods around Brown and RISD. That area has a feel closer to the Northside than any other area I've found here. Nothing here really compares to Loop, itself, unfortunately. There just isn't that kind of downtown in Providence. 

Not sure if you've spent much time in the 'burbs, but you won't find any Orlands and Napervilles in New England. Yeah, you'll get shopping plazas with some national chain staples, but you won't find mile after mile of a La Grange Rd flanked by plaza after plaza with vast expanses of subdivisions tucked behind them.

If you're familiar with the older suburbs that have popped up along the old rail lines and canal like Lemont and La Grange, image a bunch of those towns peppered throughout the forest preserve with a few houses in between.

I checked: last year, April 27 is when the real work started -- before that, the ground is too cold.

We have a tractor and some folks who drive it when the fields get prepared for planting, which is itself a whole day's work: the tractor tows an implement that mounds up a 36""-wide bed of earth, lays an irrigation line on top of it, and then seals it (against weeds, pests, and evaporation) with plastic bedding material. In between those beds, we then roll out some plastic mesh stuff in the walking aisles, which prevents weeds growing up.

Limiting evaporation uses less water; limiting pests with the barrier is good because we follow organic methods as much as we can, without an explicit organic certification. And not having to spend endless hours weeding means that fewer volunteers can produce more veggies for the food banks &amp; soup kitchens, which is the whole reason we're there.

They are actually the 3rd largest tortoises in the world if I remember correctly ( Galapagos, Aldabra then Sulcata).  Living in Rhode Island, it would be very hard to house one properly year round. Once they start getting over 40-50 lbs it becomes difficult to move them inside for the winter months. Once they hit 70lbs it becomes a very difficult 2 person job and would require a specialized pen set up in a basement or heated garage. Having a tortoise of that size you need to consider that they are like little bulldozers and can and will break all but the strongest pens. Sulcatas are known diggers and have been known to escape by digging under fencing.
I would suggest a greek or russian  tortoise for starters. They stay smaller and can take dips in temperature. If you want something a little bigger look at possibly getting a red-foot tortoise.
Having said that  take the time to look at the true costs of ownership. Lighting ,heat, enclosures bedding etc. you will find the startup costs are fairly high.

So my theory is they are buying asphalt meant to be used in Arizona, when in reality they should be using a cold-mix asphalt. It will get soft in the summer, but it won't be too bad. And any soft-issues will be offset by the money saved from more resilient roads.

We get too much cold weather to be using the mix they are using, and I don't know why no one is bringing this up with the DOT.",1578709146,fdsxawf

""FOR POTHOLES ONLY THERE IS A SPECIAL LAW IN RHODE ISLAND THAT CAPS REIMBURSEMENT AT $300.

Who's eligible?

Our state's pothole claim law only applies to cars registered in Rhode Island. If you don't live in Rhode Island you can only file a claim if the state your car is registered in has a reciprocal pothole law. What this means is your state would allow owners of Rhode Island-registered vehicles to file a pothole claim in that state.


How to file

The registered vehicle owner must submit a letter stating the exact time, date, and exact location of the incident. Please remember to include your daytime telephone number and current mailing address. You may also include your email address. Important: This initial notification must be done within seven calendar days of the incident. You have up to 60 calendar days from the incident to submit supporting documentation (see Documents to Submit below).

Documents to submit

You have 60 calendar days from the date of the incident to provide the following documents:
A copy of the valid R.I. registration for the vehicle
Copies of itemized, paid receipts with a proof of payment provided and the current odometer reading on the repair bill
One of these three documents:
A copy of a police report, or
A tow receipt, or
An auto club report
Note: If you need a police report, visit the city or town police department where the damage occurred. If the damage occurred on an Interstate highway, visit a R.I. State Police barracks to file a pothole incident report form.",1578755347,fdw5oc4

Freedom of speech doesn't mean you can't be held accountable for your words. If you're at a Pat's game in Gillette and start cheering for the other team, you should expect the home fans will boo you.

1231,toranomon87,"Frankly, you are the liar here. Not that I care about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù, but I do care about being defamed, so I write.

I think there is a massive miscommunication here caused by jumping to conclusions instead of clarifying. I am a huge champion of mental health and have benefitted tremendously from my own journey and been an influence to many others. I openly encourage therapy and the benefits of becoming more aware, mindful, and aware of self sabotaging habits driven by past trauma so that a conscious life can be led. This can be seen in my multiple posts helping people with self image issues and finding happiness and fulfillment in life across many forums ranging from Peloton Cycle to Testosterone Replacement. So I would suggest reading thoroughly before making blanket statements that are actual lies.

Regarding PTSD, I believe I have mentioned it twice in my entire Reddit existence, once in response to a thread about how testosterone therapy has helped reverse low T levels in people with prior injuries (confirming that this was true for me as well), and once in providing some past history when asking for some advice about side effects when I was starting a therapy. Much of my focus on the importance on mental health comes from the many things I learned on my journey recovering from PTSD and beyond - which goes back to my point above.

When I referred to liberals and mental health, I was making the observation that many of the most vocal and radical liberals, are often plagued by many of the mental health issues many of us are plagued with in our life journeys (anxiety/depression, struggling with fulfillment, purpose, etc) but tend to correlate and blame these issues (if they are able to even own them at all) on society and political enemies (aka conservatives), rather than embrace a mentality of self reliance and being a survivor, not a victim of circumstance. I have many times seen emotions and anger fly off the handle, and unproductive discourse from many liberals I have talked to before even saying anything simply saying I am a conservative. I have seen liberals physically assault people in Maga hats. I am not saying this is all liberals of course, but I just haven‚Äôt seen these actions the other direction (again could be personal bias but it‚Äôs traumatizing to watch). In my post I was alluding to the common perspective that conservatives tend to focus on self reliance and independence while liberals tend to focus on society and it‚Äôs influences and collectivism.

In conclusion, I understand what you‚Äôre saying, but you‚Äôre failing to own your anger and desire to invalidate what I‚Äôm saying by attacking me personally. Had you actually taken the time to read my many posts you would realize the vast vast majority of what I post is advice helping those in achieving personal fitness goals, helping answer questions on testosterone replacement therapy, and helping those struggling with mental issues that I can relate to in my journey. They are not about my PTSD, or me getting shredded, or the image you tried to paint of me. My interest and involvements in those topics comes from both a place of self love and a fascination with anti aging and keeping healthy masculinity and physical ability into old age.

And lastly. As someone who has attended Trump rallies, they are almost without exception sold out, with many camping and waiting in line the day before to ensure a good seat. What I experienced in Arizona and in Texas, and also what I saw on coverage of Ohio and other areas, is that stadiums of 30,000 or so are sold out, and there are typically another 10-30,000 outside occupying several city blocks just hoping to listen from outside. They are without question the largest turnout for any political event in the US I have ever seen, and indicate the strength of his base. So yes, maybe not 100,000, but the point I was making was that the scale is way beyond what we have seen in any other political rally event. If you have evidence to the contrary, please share it.

I could go on about jobs reports, unemployment, etc - which are the same reports we‚Äôve relied on for 100 years for the markets - showing record numbers. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

I don‚Äôt intend to convince you of my views or argue, but as I said earlier, I do intend to clear my good name when I am defamed. We can agree to disagree. There is no need to be a jerk about it.

And there is one thing we can both agree about - Trump‚Äôs demeanor and way of talking isn‚Äôt always the most presidential and often makes an ass of himself.",1578890039,fe6gbpr
1232,rick_n_snorty,"Fair enough. I skimmed your posts at first and was wrong, your first post mentions PTSD then after that they vaguely relate to mental health. If you are such a champion for mental health (which I‚Äôm not doubting you do care about, I could tell even in my initial quick skim) I would think you‚Äôd want healthcare to actually include mental health as well, insurance companies tend to not categorize mental health as healthcare. Also I would like to think someone who cares about mental health would want help available to those who need it most. I have a (non immediate) family member who is severely schizophrenic to the point he isn‚Äôt even living in the same world as the rest of us (if you wanna dm me I‚Äôll give more detail but he‚Äôs been on the cover of many newspapers for his mishaps). He‚Äôll never get help though because he doesn‚Äôt have healthcare and is not functional enough to get it on his own. If anything happens he goes to jail, not a mental hospital where he could get the drugs and treatment he needs.

Universal healthcare would help many who are too far gone to help themselves instead of just landing them in jail. Also every other country pays about 1/4 what we do for drugs because we let companies charge whatever they want for drugs (take a look at insulin prices and that‚Äôs a drug that‚Äôs necessary for a lot of people to live). Insurance companies and hospitals are for profit in the US, which is why companies like charter care buy hospitals like Fatima then cut their staff to the bare minimum and severely cut their quality of care so on paper they‚Äôre making a massive profit at the expense of their patients then they sell the hospital for a massive gain because it appears to be a really profitable hospital (take a look at the hospitals in CA that charter care destroyed before they moved to RI). 

I‚Äôm sort I think anyone who cares about mental health should want universal healthcare so the money we pay actually goes to healthcare, not in to the pockets of insurance companies and hospital owners.


Edit also after a quick lazy look [trump averages about 5k](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rallies_for_the_2016_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign)  per rally, the median is a lot lower though, a few large rallies really skew the average.

1233,-DrunkenYardbird-,What‚Äôs that?,1578893687,fe6kakz
1234,toranomon87,"All good brother. I think we can agree our healthcare system needs a lot of work. It‚Äôs amazing that we are so sophisticated technologically and scientifically, yet we are so idiotically systemically blind to the mind body connection and doctors never look at things holistically, and even worst, as you mentioned the care isn‚Äôt available to everyone in a good way. I‚Äôm not sure we have a good solution yet from either side of the aisle. I agree completely that insurance companies and hospitals are fucked and greedy - and pharmaceutical companies are making billions on treatments that make you more sick and addicted than cured. I think the unfortunate casualty tends to be doctors because they bear the most liability but in a socialized system aren‚Äôt compensated enough to justify that liability (often they pay 100k+ in malpractice insurance to defend frivolous lawsuits). Unfortunately the models of socialized medicine in other countries have been great for universal access and cost, but plagued with inefficiency, deadly delays, incompetence and not having access to the latest technologies. I lost both of my grandparents to medical errors and negligence in Italy that would have easily survived in the US.

Anyways, thanks for sharing about your family and I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your relative. Schizophrenia is a really tough thing that no one should have to go through.

Most of us - liberals and conservatives - are good regular people who want a happy and healthy life... wish people would not lose sight of that. I think we all have our challenges in life and way of thinking and have been hurt by others and it‚Äôs easy to fall into the emotional trap of thinking everyone in your party shares your beliefs and in the other party is the evil people who hurt you.

1236,toranomon87,"Totally, I also started with very little and built something. I think this is a great example of people wanting the same thing but from two different viewpoints. From my perspective capitalism gives people hope and the ability to develop a product or service and reap its benefits. Versus communism and socialism kill that by making the business owner take all the risk but not get the benefits since they are forced to be shared. In the end there is no incentive and while there are no poor there are also no successful. I think the reality is any system can work as long as corruption is limited - but if you look at Russia and China which are staples of communist policy and thinking - it has turned into the government and it‚Äôs homies are billionaires - and everyone else is ‚Äúequal‚Äù and poor with no opportunity. Obviously this is not what (most) liberals want - but from a conservative stance this is what we fear and see happening. I am the first to argue that capitalism should be well regulated though. It‚Äôs just tough in such a divided environment where no one trusts each other. I just don‚Äôt see this ending well for either side. We will bounce further and further from extremes which will mess things up. At the end of the day, because we can have this coolheaded discussion and be moderate, we can find a solution.

 The RI promise (IMO) is a flawed policy; it's essentially is a blank check to those who might not know what they want to do with their lives (be honest, did you know what you wanted to do at 18?).

No, you don‚Äôt understand what an analogy is.  You stated that the installation of renewable energy systems is a ‚Äútransient‚Äù and ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù (oh no!) job. I pointed out that the original installation of electricity and fossil-fuel home heating systems could also have been wrongly dismissed as a ‚Äútransient‚Äùjob, and yet the need for electricians, plumbers, and heating and cooling specialists remains to this day and will continue and even grow going forward. You‚Äôre trying to dismiss a growth industry because you actually don‚Äôt know anything about it.

&gt; There are only so many companies involved in the design and manufacture of windmills and solar panels, and until you can‚Äôt look around without seeing a windmill in this state, you won‚Äôt support a single maintenance tech, never mind full time employment of maintenance crews.

Translation: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt prepare for a growth industry until that growth industry already exists ‚Äî there‚Äôs no ramping up period between the initial onset and the full realization of it.‚Äù

How you finished high school with reasoning like that is a miracle. Anything that gets built needs to be maintained, fixed, and upgraded. As more people start using renewable energy ‚Äî and more efficient heating and cooling technology such as heat pumps, plug-in vehicles, etc ‚Äî there will be greater need for folks to design, build, install, maintain, and upgrade them. Someone will have to do that work. You think those people should come from outside RI ‚Äî I don‚Äôt.

Gov. Gina just announced an initiative to transition RI to 100% renewable energy within 10 years. That‚Äôs going to take an enormous amount of work, and means a lot of jobs. Who‚Äôs going to do them? But according to you, there won‚Äôt be any jobs until all of that work is done, and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt look around without seeing a windmill in this state.‚Äù I guess all those windmills will be installed by our-of-staters, and then maintained and upgraded by the thousands of RIers who never got trained because we were waiting for all the windmills to be installed first ‚Ä¶ 

&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what, other than your complete disconnect with the day to day reality of the world, would make you think designing and installing efficient HVAC systems would create new jobs, rather than being a task being done by those who already design and install such systems.

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, which is why you don‚Äôt recognize or understand it. As we transition away from fossil fuels for energy and heating and cooling, a lot of people are going to need new equipment installed in their homes and commercial buildings ‚Äî which (already) involves far more work and specialized training than the current cohort of energy and HVAC folks can handle.

Our largest source of emissions is transportation - you need a car to get practically anywhere in the state in a realistic amount of time, despite being the smallest state in the nation.

If you want to get serious about reducing emissions and PERSONALLY take action that can make a REAL IMPACT, every single person who is concerned about climate change should be supporting the Great Streets Initiative to make our roads safe for all users, and not just for cars.

 [http://www.providenceri.gov/planning/great-streets/](http://www.providenceri.gov/planning/great-streets/) 

This plan will put a network of separated bike lanes all around the capital, with connections to existing and planned routes to other parts of the state. If you have ever tried to cycle anywhere other than the peripheral, designated areas in this state, you would recognize how badly needed this type of infrastructure is, especially with how terrible the drivers are.

[Our Streets Providence](https://ourstreetspvd.org/) is an advocacy organization set up specifically to support this type of transformation.

 [https://ourstreetspvd.org/](https://ourstreetspvd.org/) 

If you are not supporting this initiative and organization, you are not supporting climate change mitigation in the state, full stop. We are already a leader in many ways, but our transportation situation is both an embarrassment and represents extremely accessible low hanging fruit for improvement, especially given the small scale of the state.

Get on twitter. [Go to the meetings and advocate](https://twitter.com/ProvPlanning/status/1217576986308161537) for more bike lanes and transit improvements.

&gt; The FY 2021 budget includes the legalization of adult use marijuana. This legalization takes the form of a state-control model, similar to how liquor sales are regulated in New Hampshire and over a dozen states. The state would hire a contractor to acquire adult use marijuana and operate retail stores on the state's behalf. This regulatory approach will allow the state to control distribution, prevent youth consumption, and protect public health. Similar to the state lottery and gaming, the state will receive a share of retail sales revenue net of the wholesale cost of marijuana products. The state share is 61 percent, while the contractor would receive 29 percent, and municipalities would receive 10 percent. Regulatory and public health expenditures would be appropriated out of the state share of revenue. Net of those expenditures, the general revenue transfer from adult use marijuana is expected to be $21.8 million in FY 2020.

Yeah, $21.8MM +/- the share that could get misappropriated into lush government construction projects for the spaces allocated to grow, test and sell (retail space) required. 

I hope legislation includes resources and a framework for a ""government watchdog"" team when we're talking about this kind of money and level of change. At about a fee, taxpayers could get a better sense of comfort from the potential misuses of public trust in this program.

Some snippets:

&gt;‚ÄùFrom 2011 to 2019, the average price of a newly listed condo in New York soared from $1.15 million to $3.77 million.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;But the bust is upon us. Today, *nearly half* of the Manhattan luxury-condo units that have come onto the market in the past five years are still unsold, according to the *New York Times*.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;What happened? While real estate might seem like the world‚Äôs most local industry, **these luxury condos weren‚Äôt exclusively built for locals**. They were also made for foreigners with tens of millions of dollars to spare.‚Äù
&gt;&gt;
&gt;‚Ä¶
&gt;&gt;
&gt;‚ÄùThis is not normal. And for middle-class families, particularly for the immigrants who give New York City so much of its dynamism, it has made living in Manhattan or gentrified Brooklyn practically impossible. No wonder, then, that *the New York City area is losing about 300 residents every day*. It adds up to what Michael Greenberg, writing for the *New York Review of Books*, called **a new shameful form of housing discrimination** ‚Äî‚Äòbluelining‚Äô:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;‚Äô*We speak nowadays with contrition about redlining, the mid-twentieth-century practice by banks of starving black neighborhoods of mortgages, home improvement loans, and investment of almost any sort. We may soon look with equal shame on what might come to be known as bluelining: the transfiguration of those same neighborhoods with a deluge of investment aimed at a wealthier class*.‚Äô‚Äù
&gt;&gt;
&gt;‚Ä¶
&gt;&gt;
&gt;‚ÄùIn 2010, one might have thought that the defining housing story of the century would be the [last] *real-estate bubble* that plunged the U.S. economy into a recession. But the past decade has been defined by the juxtaposition of **rampant luxury-home building** and **the cratering of middle-class-home construction**. The future might restore a measure of sanity, both to New York‚Äôs housing crisis and America‚Äôs. But for now, the nation is bluelining itself to death.‚Äù",1579412941,fewksle

Renewable energy is about latter; garbage on the ground is about aesthetics.

What amazes me is that Vermont passed [Act 60](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_60_(Vermont_law)) over 20 years ago and I'm not aware of any other states enacting similar programs. 

What I appreciate about the Act 60/68 system is that it creates a hard spending floor but has a soft spending ceiling. All schools are guaranteed to have the same base funding but districts can spend more if they choose (up to 25% above the floor, and if local funding allows).

So actually its about 6.7-6.8 years total by my calculations:                
System cost $15,900  (5.13 Kw system)      
30% Tax credit: $4,770       
Net cost: $11,130         

I signed up for the Renewable energy growth program, which pays me 37.65 cents per KwH generated, for a term of 15 years. (I know this rate has likely dropped over the past few years)          

I pay the normal Nat grid rates to buy electricity, like anyone else. But about half of whats generated is used as a reduction on my bill, so most months I have a $5 or so power bill. The rest of the money left over is deposited in my bank account every month. (more in the summer, less in the winter)       

Total received in bill credits and cash so far:     
2017: $1,597 (only 10 months, went live in March 2017)              
2018: $1,690      
2019: $1,760      
Total received over 3 years: $5047

Net system cost after tax credit: $11,130         
Minus money received so far:        $5047      
Remaining payoff at start of 2020: $6083         
Assuming I get $1600/yr for the next 3.8 years, that's $6080 more cash back, which pays it off.             

The key is to not take the flat RI credit as that was only like $3k or $4k if I remember correctly. The REG program is much better over the long term. To be fair, this doesn't factor in interest paid on my loan, so its slightly more. I used some of my own cash, combined with a Home equity loan at 2.9% for the rest.

I don't know if you know this but police are generally people with guns and in this case they used the threat of force to shut down a business. If anyone put up a fight or resisted then they would then use that force.

Nothing of what /u/Steve-2112 said was untrue. And your saying "" Just stop. Pay your taxes. "" As if people who make these arguments aren't already paying taxes. Most likely they are and are arguing that its theft and they should no longer be collected. Besides your premise is wrong on its face. You don't pay your taxes the government takes them. It's the difference between a voluntary action and a coerced action.

And the circular logic of this story is that they're shutting down a revenue generating business for not having enough money. So your shutting down that businesses only avenue of paying you the money. And if that process goes along then eventually the owners of the business go to jail and they go from entities paying taxes to entities receiving tax paid services in the form of jail, and meals.

You are unequivocally wrong.  Cops do not go around collecting taxes through threat of ‚Äúviolence.‚Äù  If a cop arrests a criminal who has broken the law, and has to restrain then, how the fuck is that violence?

2182,CivilCJ,"I think it comes from being such a small state located in a megalopolis.  All of our surrounding macroenvironments are heavily industrialized creating more active and intense atmospheres which usually includes heavy amounts of transportation.  However, RI is not as popular so the demand for public transportation is low leaving the roads to soak up the mobile populace.  Not only that, but being the smallest state there is a mentality that gives us the idea that nothing is really that far away.  When things feel closer the trip doesn't feel as demanding and therefore drivers tend to be less careful because, hey, it's only a few minutes away, why are you stressing?  Plus, we are in New England, an area notorious for having winding, erratic road patterns.  I'd argue that these patterns not only keep us on our toes, getting us used to driving in inconsistent environments; but the lack of long stretches of straight roads adds to the small town feeling.  As an example, I lived in DE for a few years, which is the second smallest state btw.  The difference between RI and DE roads is that DE has, in comparison, much straighter, longer roads.  After moving from RI, these roads felt eternal at times which made driving feel more like a task to pay attention to rather than just a means to move around.  So, the winding roads with less visibility makes the already short trips feel even shorter.  Add being located between Boston and NYC with I-95 running right through our little state and viola, you get metropolitan level traffic with the small town attitude of ""if you don't like it, leave.""  It's not that we deal with crazy drivers a lot, we learn how to drive crazy, because that's the environment in which we were taught.  

TL;DR - Yeah, sorry, the majority of us most likely literally don't know any better or that we are doing anything wrong.  We were taught to drive in these conditions.  Make sure you've got decent insurance and good luck.",1579785939,ffbxhom

2194,kfl85,"I'll try and give you an unbiased opinion, I'm From FL but have lived all over the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest and have traveled pretty extensively around the US and World. 

The Good: 

* RI is a very pretty state, lots of water (which will be quite a departure from CO) 
* Outdoor activities are very accessible and easy to get to (hiking/biking/water activities/Mountains/beach/skiing -albeit east coast skiing) 
* Great food and drink scene (lousy Mexican/no Cuban but the restaurants and beer in the state is legit) 
* Healthcare is good, if you have good insurance (lots of local hospitals with great care as well as easy access to Boston if you need something extremely specialized)
* Getting around New England is pretty easy, compared to Denver Traffic Providence is a joke. Its pretty cool to be able to be in the mountains hiking in the morning and be on the beach in the afternoon for sunset

The So So:

* People are a bit of a debate here, RI can be extremely insular depending on the part of the state you live in, the state can have a very small town feel which can be both good and bad.   I've found New Englanders to be harder to get to know and be friends with than Southerners and less ""outgoing"" than people from the West, That being said this has been my experience and yours may differ depending on where you live in the State
* Politically the leadership is ""Democrat"" but you'll find they tend to be more on the Conservative side. The Cities and towns around the Providence Metro are very progressive so its probably not a big departure from the Denver Metro
* Real Estate is heavily dependent on City, if you're moving from the Denver Metro area you'll find the prices are probably comparable but the tax will be a lot higher. That being said I bought my house in the Edgewood Neighborhood in Cranston and I live 2 blocks from the water, less than a mile from our little town center, and 3 miles from downtown Providence and I paid about $300K (granted the house needed work) 2 years ago. Prices in my neighborhood are around \~$300-450K mark for a 4/1 or 3/2 depending on condition of the home  

The not so Good: 

* Schools in the state are very City dependent and for the most part the school systems aren't that great unless you live in East Greenwich or Barrington (Cranston and Kingstown are okay, but avoid Providence at all costs)  
* Taxes here (and in New England as a whole) are very high. You'll find your Property Tax is going to be 2-3 times higher here, there is an excise tax on cars that is very high, Sales tax is 7%, Taxes are also very city dependent (we have 44 cities in state the size of Houston TX) so make sure you research each one carefully 
* Jobs are a hot topic of debate here, RI is traditionally more of a Blue Collar state. That being said if you aren't in Healthcare, Tourism, or some sort of Service oriented job finding a job can be tough. Boston has a much more diverse Job market but RI is trying. I personally work remotely for a Tech company so the best bet is to come with a Job if you can...
* The state as a whole is pretty corrupt and there is a lot of nepotism in state jobs (its a small state so everyone tends to know everyone). The corruption goes back to when the Mob ruled a lot of the state, there are some fun podcasts on this (Check out Crimetown).   

We moved here from Texas about 4 years ago for my Wife's job at the Hospital and we've enjoyed our time here overall. RI will not be our last stop, but its been a cool place to live so far. Depending on what your house budget is and your Job you might want to look at a suburb of Boston off the Rail line. Everyone complains about the Rail line but for the most part its pretty reliable. That being said it's always cool to have another neighbor that has some of that West Coast vibe. PM me if you have other questions.",1579787361,ffbz6ud

2196,CivilCJ,"Yep, born and raised in Newport, so I have it to even more of an extreme.  I have to go over the bridges?  Well, better pack a cooler cause it's a day trip!  That's exactly the thinking I'm referring to.  We don't drive far, so our trips are always really easy, making driving less of a chore.  Look at it this way, large corporations like fast food and retail usually spread out their stores based on population density and regional size.  With RI having a decent population but a very small size, more stores get crammed into a smaller space, travel time goes down.  Add to that the fact that a sizable portion of RI's land is separated by water and everything is condensed even further.  So yeah, we don't travel far because we don't need to, and not needing to drive for long distances/periods of time leads to less practice and overconfidence.  Yes, I'll admit my driver's ed was kind of bullshit and I've heard similar from other peoples' experiences, but I'd put my money on disregard.  For instance, in Newport county (essentially all the islands) the highest speed limit is 40mph.  It's one road that you drive on for about 90 seconds max.  The only road higher than 35 for the whole county.  Driving around here is super easy and yeah, we rarely leave the island.  So when we eventually do leave, we drive with the confidence of island life and the chaos of metropolitan New England.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;As news of the audit broke, the state Republican Party accused Mattiello of using the investigation as retaliation for the disciplinary action against Demers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;James McCarvill, executive director of the Convention Center Authority, described the relationship between Demers and Mattiello: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre friends and neighbors, that‚Äôs all I know,‚Äù he told the *Providence Journal*.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;McCarvill declined to say why the pair had been suspended, except to say that it was a personnel matter that was not financial in nature. The day-to-day operations of the convention center are handled by ASM Global, a Los Angeles-based management company under contract with the convention center authority. Demers and Wilmouth are among roughly 100 full-time employees of ASM Global at the convention center, in addition to more than 1,000 part-time workers, primarily event staff.
&gt;&gt;

If this is how it's going to be, then they need to do what Trump did at the federal level and simply not make it mandatory.

I couldn't afford insurence when i made 40k really, the cheapest i found through healthsorce was over 100 a week and covered literally nothing, with high co pays for what it did cover, like 1000s in copays, so i couldnt even just get checkups without paying full price. 
Its still cheaper to pay the fine, but its such a kick in the teeth, like when a bank charges you for not having enough money.

Plus an hour of the carousel.  Wedding ceremony was on the boardwalk overlooking the beach and they set up chairs for that too.

I saved a lot of money on the bar.  I hired 2 TIPs certified bartenders and bought all my booze from a local package store.  The packy let me have all the wine, beer, and liquor I wanted and after the wedding I returned anything that wasn't open and paid my tab.  They took off 20% for a cash discount.

Absolutely agree - not a bargain.  Anthony's is relatively cheap, but its a big step down in ambience

&gt;Haven't been to either pizza place you mentioned, so I'm excited to have two new ones to check out.

Catanzaro's has great ingredients (homemade meatballs, fresh portobello mushrooms, handcut pepperoni, etc) and Famous Pizza serves a more traditional square pie - both great in their own way

&gt;Haven't been to New Dragon either, would you say it's worth traveling to Narragansett for if you live in Riverside? 

Absolutely *not* worth driving from Riverside - it's the just the best place close to our house

&gt;Have you been to Den Den or Boneheads

Never been to Den Den's, but I've been to Boneheads.  My wings were kinda... soggy.  Nikolas (while a little pricey) manages to keep a nice crisp on them and the flavor is great.

&gt;(not but D&amp;D trash)

DD does not serve a respectable donut.  It's a shame to even call them donuts.  

&gt;I'm not familiar with Beavertail, I'll be checking it out (as soon as I'm over my knee injury).

When you're fully healed, definitely head down..  park in Lot 1 or Lot 2 and follow the trails from there down toward the water.  There's a path that parallels the coastline, and there are places dotted all along that way where you can scramble down the rocks and check out tide pools and small beaches at low tide.  Sunset is amazing as well.

Also, if you're looking for a nice calm beach, you can buy a day pass to go to the Jamestown Town Beach (Mackerel Cove) for like $20 I think.  Very limited parking, so it's rarely super crowded",1580162050,ffro236

For pizza, Felinni's and Nice Slice are top tier thin slice pizza. Tommy's and Catanzaro's are great pan pizzas, and Caserta's is the closest I've seen to Detroit/Chicago in RI (aside from Uno's which I'd rather pretend doesn't exist).

I haven't been to Cozy Grill but T's is so bland, it getting a mention over the other local breakfast joints is criminal! Bayberry and Revival do brunch on the weekends that's great. Milk Money is excellent. Dante's in East Greenwich is right down the road from T's and always packed. And then there's Kitchen on Carpenter Street in Providence. Rumor is the cook is a three michelin star chef that retired and opened Kitchen for fun. I 300% believe it. His croissant french toast was incredible, and he somehow manages to cook a 1/4"" thick cut of bacon to be both crispy, juicy, and just the right amount of tender. I'd eat there every weekend if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to get a seat; there's 6 tables and a perpetual line down the street. 

I've had Cold Stone three times. There was so much sugar in the actual ice cream I could barely taste the flavor. You like what you like, but Cold Stone over Three Sisters or Inside Scoop? Tricyle is really great too (their gourmet choco taco is awesome) and Like No Udder is great vegan ice cream too. 


Again not trying to yuck your yum but those three had me let out an audible ""really??"" 

Two other thoughts:


Keep an eye on Knead's instagram for a Night Crueller's night. Some weekend nights after 6pm they open the window to their kitchen and serve fresh, hot, donuts literally right off the fryer. Their donuts are great, but their hot donuts are on another level.

A ‚Äúghost gun‚Äù is a gun that has not serial number, and therefore can‚Äôt be traced back to a manufacturing, a distributor, retailer or purchaser.  This law is mainly intended to outlaw any firearm in the state that lacks a serial number.  

But I think a lot of people are thinking that a ‚Äúghost gun‚Äù is when it‚Äôs made of plastic, for the purpose of being undetectable via a metal detector.  I have, as well as you, been able to produce a ‚Äúghost gun‚Äù since they started to come about as long as it was for personal use only and not for sale.  I could always make a gun which lacked a serial number because of that.  

What this law does is to intend to outlaw something that is not against the law on the federal level.  It goes beyond the federal reach but not allowing any firearm without a serial number, whether its made of plastic or not.  It‚Äôs just that they are hounding on the plastic par it seems because that‚Äôs what they thought they had during the homicide in Pawtucket, which they thought was a 3D printed firearm by the suspects.

Then when you get to where you‚Äôre going you can take a few layers off as you warm up. Get a pair or waterproof boots as well and for socks you just need long ones, they don‚Äôt have to be wool unless you plan on being outdoors for a long time. 

A scarf is also great to have, for some reason I never wore them until now and they really keep you a lot warmer - keeps the cold air from blowing on your neck and down into your coat. And a good pair of winter gloves. 

I don‚Äôt buy the crazy expensive winter gear, Target or look for sales on winter stuff as stores get ready for spring. I got a nice down vest for $20 that was normally like $100 last year at the end of February. I see a lot of people wearing $800 Canada Goose coats around here which seems unnecessary and  frickin insane to me.",1580471810,fg362ww

Thicker socks are not warmer, just worse and a pain to deal with.

Moderate temps (maybe 32F to 50F) I wear jeans, an undershirt/tshirt, a long sleeve shirt / thin sweater, and an outer layer depending on how cold it is - sweatshirt up through ski coat. A beanie never hurts. Don't go overboard on the gloves, too thick and your hands will sweat, which is counterproductive and gross.

If it gets really cold or windy, long underwear under the jeans works great. And a wind break layer on top (the ski coat is good here). Gloves can upgrade to something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/OZERO-Gloves-Winter-Thermal-Insulated/dp/B07TH1TBTT/ref=sxin_3_ac_d_pm?ac_md=2-1-QmV0d2VlbiAkMTAgYW5kICQ1MA%3D%3D-ac_d_pm&amp;cv_ct_cx=winter+gloves&amp;keywords=winter+gloves&amp;pd_rd_i=B07TH1TBTT&amp;pd_rd_r=7aef0553-0ed8-4268-80b4-8e0667dfb3fb&amp;pd_rd_w=hbjnP&amp;pd_rd_wg=W8h2L&amp;pf_rd_p=516e6e17-ed95-417b-b7a4-ad2c7b9cbae3&amp;pf_rd_r=TV0352ACD1SS7XBTRFZN&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1580475051&amp;s=outdoor-recreation&amp;sr=1-2-22d05c05-1231-4126-b7c4-3e7a9c0027d0) and a [bomber hat](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bomber+hat&amp;rh=n%3A2474988011&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss) is overkill and silly but will definitely keep you warm.

I would suggest a good winter coat,  hat, gloves and a pair of boots. That should be all you need. Snow pants come in handy when you are shoveling snow, or playing in the snow, but are not needed for daily wear. Right now, a lot of places like Columbia and LL Bean are having their winter clearance sales, so you should get some deals if you want to shop online.

RI has milder winters than the rest of NE, so unless you are living in Foster, I wouldn‚Äôt  worry too much. This winter has been pretty mild, but late Feb/March can pack a punch.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;The state was doing poorly in ‚Äúadvanced industries,‚Äù including those that do a lot of research and development, and employ workers with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) skills, he said.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;But the existing base of advanced industries has grown since then. Advanced industry areas identified in the first report grew by 5 percent more than the Rhode Island economy as a whole between 2013 and 2017, the report said.‚Äù

&gt;‚Ä¶
&gt;&gt;
&gt; But the report cited a variety of challenges facing the Rhode Island economy. For example, it said, ‚ÄúCompetition with neighboring states is undermined by unreliable public school quality and a lack of adequate housing options for workers, particularly those with families.‚Äù

This name uses a older definition of plantations pretty much just meaning a colony. The providence plantations part refers to the mainland part of state. Providence, Warwick, South Kingston, Foster ect.

Remember dictionary definition is a estate that uses a resident workforce for profit. Thanks to the South extensive use of slavery on their plantations it now implies the workforce has to be slaves. Not the case for  RI. 

As for the RI part I took this off the state site. 

This state was named by Dutch explorer Adrian Block. He named it ""Roodt Eylandt"" meaning ""red island"" in reference to the red clay that lined the shore. The name was later anglicized when the region came under British rule.

3699,LilPeanutt,"&gt;‚ÄùDrugs are good ‚Äî drugs are so good that they may become the only source of pleasure in one‚Äôs life.‚Äù Those may not be words that you would expect from someone in charge of a national drug policy, but Dr. Jo√£o Goul√£o knows what he‚Äôs talking about. On January 9, a crowd of about 75, including several state legislators, gathered in the State House Library for a program called ‚ÄúHow To Solve A Drug Crisis: Lessons from Portugal‚Äù to hear the drug czar reflect on the successes of the Portuguese approach to drug use and misuse, and what lessons we might be able to apply to RI‚Äôs drug crisis. Hosted by Rep. Scott Slater, the Center for Biomedical Research and Excellence (COBRE) on Opioids &amp; Overdose, and the Substance Use Policy, Education and Recovery (SUPER) PAC, the educational event aimed to broaden attendees‚Äô perspectives in terms of addressing addiction and overdose through a public health lens, rather than a criminal justice one.

&gt;In the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s, 1% of Portugal‚Äôs population was addicted to heroin. Since adopting the new policy in 2001, overdose deaths are down 80% (the lowest overdose death rate in Europe) and drug-related social costs have decreased 18%. HIV rates, youth drug use and problematic drug use rates have all declined as well. When the program began, there were 100,000 heroin users in Portugal. Now, there are fewer than 50,000 citizens addicted to any drug at all, and of those, 30,000 are taking advantage of treatment options. **In 2017, Portugal lost 38 citizens to overdose out of a population of 10 million. By contrast, Rhode Island lost 314 people in 2018 ‚Äì under a policy as successful as Portugal‚Äôs, we may only have lost 4.**

The results are certainly clear, but **what makes Portugal‚Äôs drug policy so successful? First, they recognize addiction as a public health issue, not a criminal one. It starts with education ‚Äî children are taught from a very young age not necessarily that drugs are bad, but about sources of pleasure and how substances can play a role in pleasure-seeking behaviors. Along with evidence-based preventative measures, in 2001 Portugal became the first country to decriminalize the use and possession of all illicit drugs.** [It‚Äôs important to note that ‚Äúdecriminalizing‚Äù and ‚Äúlegalizing‚Äù are not the same, and Portugal did not create any type of market industry for selling drugs, similar to how Rhode Island has decriminalized the use and possession of cannabis, without legalizing it for adult use.] In Portugal, when someone is caught with a small amount of drugs (the limit is based on 10 days of personal use), instead of being arrested, they appear before a Ministry of Health panel consisting of a psychologist, a social worker and a lawyer. The panel addresses what the patient‚Äôs needs are, if they are struggling with addiction, or what kind of difficulties they may be facing in life that could be causing them to use drugs. If they are struggling with addictive behaviors, they are able to seek help immediately, free of charge. 

&gt;This system effectively interrupts the pathway from recreational drug use to serious addiction and overdose. In fact, Portugal has built a comprehensive system of addiction care, funded by the profits of state lotteries, that offers tailor-made treatment and harm reduction services to anyone who would benefit, including those who struggle with addictions to alcohol, gambling and the like ‚Äî all covered under their universal health care system. This program, known as the Service for Intervention of Addictive Behaviors and Dependencies, includes indefinite treatment despite repeated relapses (‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt give up, we are there‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt drop people‚Äù), as well as harm reduction measures to keep people safe, including safe injection facilities, drug checking sites and safer opioid substitution treatments like methadone and buprenorphine. And although Portuguese prisons aren‚Äôt as overcrowded as they used to be, even those that are incarcerated have access to these services. According to Dr. Goul√£o, the program is ‚Äúcheap‚Äù to maintain, and well worth the investment. Despite some initial resistance from police and politicians, he says, now no one wants to go back to the way things were.

&gt;**Of course, unlike Portugal, Rhode Island doesn‚Äôt have universal health care, and we do have fentanyl, which the Portuguese have not had the misfortune of dealing with yet. Portugal‚Äôs drug addiction issues are not as affected by the influence of pharmaceutical companies as ours are here in the US.** Despite these differences, Dr. Goul√£o believes that in Rhode Island, we have all the tools to have a drug policy as successful as Portugal‚Äôs. If that is true, then what is stopping us from striving for the same sort of success? Is it Big Pharma, our dysfunctional health care system or just plain ignorance? According to Dr. Goul√£o, decision-makers need to hear the public voice in order to make a program like this possible in the US; a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù approach to policy-making, he says, is critical for success.

&gt;Kudos to the organizers of the event, and to Scott Slater for taking the lead toward better drug policies in the RI legislature by recently sponsoring a bill to reclassify drug possession from a felony to a two-year misdemeanor. He, like so many others, understands that treating addiction as a health issue, rather than a criminal issue, will not only allow us to focus police resources on violent crimes and organized drug distribution, but more importantly, it would save many lives. Some may say that we can‚Äôt afford to implement a program like Portugal‚Äôs, but I would argue that we can‚Äôt afford not to.",1581092969,fgsukvd

Your description of Fane Tower certainly sounds familiar to me, but I also know that the city will ignore the port pollution as long as it only affects poor people and even some middle-class folks (if they‚Äôre not organized), but once developers discover the port-facing ‚Äúwaterfront‚Äù as a destination address and start banging up apartments there, the idea of a working port / industrial area will start getting scaled back ‚Ä¶

For RussianPigMan to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs always been a port and always will be‚Äù shows a naive unfamiliarity with how these areas get converted surprisingly fast once there are moneyed interests who want to do something else with them. The only thing that might slow that process is the almost inevitable presence of toxic pollutants that will have to be ‚Äúremediated‚Äù, which is a fancy way of saying ‚Äútrucked to Johnston‚Äù ‚Ä¶

&gt;As for the port. I hear there is a plan to start importing raw sewage from surrounding states to dump repurpose for the ah, mmm... the environment. All proceeds from said project will be deposited directly into the general fund and swiftly redirected to lucrative contracts for well connected business owners.

This right here is why no one takes gun nuts seriously. When every fucking law no matter how small or benign is treated as the end of days for guns then people will stop listening, like the boy who cried wolf.*

The problem is two fold, 

1. All those incremental laws are an infringement, Background checks, (while I agree with them) are an infringement, while I‚Äôm ok with having Machine Guns and explosives registered, technically it‚Äôs an infringement. 

And if I could snap my fingers and change it, I‚Äôd take a page out of Kentucky‚Äôs constitution (They have it as shall not be infringed with the exception of regulations on concealed carry), and make it so background checks, MG, and explosive registration was amended into the constitution. I‚Äôd also make it so non violent felons were not barred from ownership, while violent felons could be suspended for a length depending on the crime committed, and the ruling of a jury. Murders without any mitigating factors? Barred for life, rapists? Barred for life, some college kids that got into a bar fight in their 20‚Äôs and haven‚Äôt had anything other than a speeding or parking ticket for 10 years? They shouldn‚Äôt be barred forever.

2. Gun owners have seen the incremental march of gun control, over the last 86 years. Each time it‚Äôs ‚Äúif you give a mouse a cookie‚Äù.  We‚Äôve compromised a number of times, and we just don‚Äôt trust the anti‚Äôs anymore.


As for your last point
*He never explains why is supposedly ‚Äústupid‚Äù probably because he can‚Äôt. The fact of the matter is that high capacity mags have been used to cause massive injury and death and the only legitimate uses for them seem to be to cause masive injury or fucking around at the range, so to most normal people the idea of banning mags with more than 10 rounds makes perfect sense and has basically no downsides. The video did absolutely nothing to counter tgat thought*

The question is what is an acceptable number as people will inevitably die from gun violence, however we can exclude suicides as they don‚Äôt require more than one round.

Between 800,000 and 1,000,000 ‚Äúhigh capacity‚Äù mags flooded California in 6 days while a federal judge issued an injunction on the ban which was over two decades old. Given the homicide rate in CA, and the flood of mags, with other gun control uneffected by that 6 day window of injunction, how much will the homicide rate rise?

If you had an extra 4-5 deaths a year in CA, does that out way the near 1,000,000 floating around which are used in a manner that does not harm anyone else? 

Is it even possible to judge the effectiveness of a magazine ban? Everyone I‚Äôve seen limits the capacity to 10 rounds, yet reload speed is so quick, that a practiced shooter can be firing within two seconds. Does it make something like Dayton harder? Yes, but statistically mass shootings like Dayton or El Paso are a statistical anomaly, with the FBI reporting 85 deaths from mass murders in 2018. 

Far more common are the shootings involving gangs. The vast majority of gun murders come from cities. I truly believe that it can be solved by addressing the socioeconomic factors which give gangs strength.

End the war on drugs, invest in underserved communities education/infrastructure, allow felonies to be expunged after a number of years clean from crime, so they can have a chance at better jobs.",1581238267,fh272a3

3807,sneezy137,"The reason he‚Äôs complaining about what he calls the ‚Äútattletale‚Äù Bill is because it would essentially create a registry of people who are simply exercising their rights which many feel would be unconstitutional and if applied to any other amendment in the bill of rights would cause an uproar. 

He also complains about the ‚Äúghost gun‚Äù ban. This would require that any homemade firearm be serialized in accordance with  27 CFR ¬ß 479.102 which is the federal requirement normally only required if the gun is sold. It would also require the submission of an NFA form 1 to the ATF which would presumably include the $200 tax stamp despite homemade firearms not falling under the NFA unless they are an SBR, SBS, AOW, or MG. If this was not followed the owner would face up to ten years in jail. It also bans undetectable firearms which it defines as the following 


‚ÄúUndetectable firearm"" means any firearm that:
(i) After removal of all parts, other than a major component, is not as detectable by walk- through metal detectors commonly used at airports or other public buildings; or
(ii) Any major component of which, if subjected to inspection by the types of detection devices commonly used at airports or other public buildings for security screening, would not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the component‚Äù

Since the frame or receiver is considered the ‚Äúfirearm‚Äù and is also considered a major component under this bill it is feared that the bill could be used to go after polymer frame handguns such as Glocks in addition it would ban an entire class of firearms outright. This should be obvious as to why it is considered unconstitutional by many gun rights advocates. 

[Here is the text of the ‚Äúghost gun‚Äù ban. ](https://legiscan.com/RI/text/S2004/id/2106583/Rhode_Island-2020-S2004-Comm_Sub.pdf) 

Then we get to the ‚Äúhigh capacity‚Äù magazine ban. This is obviously unconstitutional and reading judge Benitez‚Äôs ruling in Duncan v. Becerra should show you why.

 [Link to Duncan v. Becerra ](http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Duncan-2019-03-29-Order-Granting-Plaintiffs-MSJ.pdf) 

[Here is the text of the magazine ban](https://legiscan.com/RI/text/S2130/id/2108232/Rhode_Island-2020-S2130-Introduced.pdf) 

Then we get to the ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù ban. Read DC v. Heller and it should show why this bill is considered unconstitutional by many. Here are some highlights from the majority opinion. 

‚ÄúSome have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35‚Äì36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.‚Äù

‚ÄúPutting all of these textual elements together, we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it ‚Äúshall not be infringed.‚Äù As we said in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 553 (1876), ‚Äú[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed.‚Äù

This one works if you simply replace handgun with ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù 

‚ÄúAs the quotations earlier in this opinion demonstrate, the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right. The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of ‚Äúarms‚Äù that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute.‚Äù 

And here is the GA Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in Nunn v. Georgia. 

‚ÄúThe right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree‚Äù 

All these quotes and more more can be found in the majority opinion of Heller [[Link] ](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf)

3861,dionidium,"*Of course* nobody wants to be unsafe, which leads to a pretty obvious question: *why does anybody ever live in an ""unsafe"" neighborhood?*

We all make decisions based on what we're willing to trade for safety, what we can afford, and so on. 

When somebody asks you where you want to live, ""somewhere safe"" *doesn't actually say anything*. It doesn't give enough information. Safe is *always* -- always! -- relative to cost and other considerations. 

So, no, actually *I have no fucking idea* what other people consider safe or not. And neither do you. At best you're just assuming everybody else has your exact risk tolerance, but I hate to have to be the one to tell you that's not true. If it were, then nobody who could afford it would ever live in a big city. But plenty of us do, obviously. [0]

I really don't mean to sound like an asshole. As far as I can tell, this is just an actual feature of the universe that a lot of people don't understand, for some reason.

By the way: I'm not just, like, making this up to be difficult. It's a core belief of security researchers, for example. Bruce Schneier is someone you could read on this subject. 

https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_schneier_the_security_mirage/transcript?language=en

[0] *I suspect, based only on this short interaction, that you and I, for example, fall at very different points on this continuum. I've noticed that a lot of people who live in suburbs find the choices of people who could afford to, but who don't, to be incomprehensible for this very reason. It's because they're operating as though there's a universal definition of ""safe"" we all agree on, just like you are. But there isn't.*

*To give just one example: I regard Federal Hill, where I live, as remarkably safe, well within my tolerance of how safe a neighborhood needs to be. I'd recommend it as ""safe."" But I know from talking to many Rhode Islanders that they'd never even consider living somewhere that unsafe.*

*And to point out something far more controversial (but also true): people who live in suburbs and therefore drive more are far more likely to die or be seriously injured in a car crash than an average citizen is to be harmed by violent crime in even the most dangerous neighborhood. Which goes to show that what people actually care about is the feeling of safety, not safety itself. (This is also touched on in that video.)*",1581298720,fh6go5p

&gt;**A Rhode Island priest who banned lawmakers from receiving communion due to their pro-choice stance defended the controversial move by arguing ‚Äúpedophilia doesn‚Äôt kill anyone and this does.‚Äù**


&gt;**The Rev. Richard Bucci, a pastor at the Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick, released a letter last week naming 44 lawmakers who he said should not be allowed to receive communion after they voted in support of the Reproductive Privacy Act, according to CBS News.**

&gt;He sparked further controversy with his defense of the move during a recent interview with Massachusetts news station WJAR.

&gt;**‚ÄùWe are not talking about any other moral issue, where some may make it a comparison between pedophilia and abortion. Pedophilia doesn‚Äôt kill anyone and this does,‚Äù Bucci, 72, told the TV outlet.**

&gt;The Reproductive Privacy Act was signed into law last May and serves as a protection of abortion rights in Rhode Island.

&gt;In response to the decision by Bucci to ban lawmakers from receiving communion, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence told WJAR that it‚Äôs up to each pastor to apply the preparations taught by the church to his own parish.

&gt;‚ÄùThis includes the proper reception of Holy Communion as outlined by the Code of Canon Law,‚Äù Carolyn Cronin said earlier this month. ‚ÄúBecause the Church entrusts to each pastor the duty of teaching, sanctifying, and governing his parish, the daily pastoral and administrative decisions are made at the local parish level.""

&gt;Bucci‚Äôs comments about pedophilia were slammed by several Rhode Island politicians, including State Representative Carol Hagan McEntee.

&gt;**‚ÄùFather Bucci should have come to the State House to listen to the heart wrenching stories from victims of pedophilia,‚Äù she tweeted. ‚ÄúThe injured voices I have heard have nearly had their lives destroyed. The ones we hear from are the lucky ones who are still alive.‚Äù**",1581437293,fhb8wx1

&gt;A West Warwick parish priest said he could have expressed himself more clearly when he said in a television interview that unlike abortion, ‚Äúpedophilia doesn‚Äôt kill anyone.‚Äù

Could have, but didn‚Äôt. 

&gt;The Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church said Tuesday that he‚Äôs well aware that victims of sexual abuse suffer immensely. He knows about the toll of child sexual abuse, he said, because he has supported victims and because he was the first one to blow the whistle on an abusive priest.

&gt;‚ÄùI should have made it clearer that I wasn‚Äôt saying there was no suffering to the person who is abused physically,‚Äù Father Bucci said Tuesday. ‚ÄúEspecially a child who puts their trust in faith, whether it be a priest, a rabbi, an uncle, a parent. That‚Äôs absolute.‚Äù

&gt;The *outspoken* Bucci has made multiple rounds of headlines since he barred Rhode Island lawmakers who voted to codify abortion rights in the state from receiving Communion. Bucci said in a letter that they were also barred from acting as ‚Äúwitnesses to marriage, godparents, or lectors at weddings, funerals or any other church function.‚Äù

Outspoken? Such a cute way of saying Bucci is a menace. 

&gt;**In an interview on Sunday with Channel 10, Bucci said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not talking about any other moral issue, where some may make a comparison between pedophilia and abortion. Well, pedophilia doesn‚Äôt kill anyone, and this does.‚Äù**

&gt;Those comments in particular have now rocketed around the national media, with CBS News, Newsweek and the New York Daily News picking up the story about the Diocese of Providence priest. The stories have focused on one part of his comment ‚Äî that pedophilia doesn‚Äôt kill anyone.

&gt;But Bucci said he did not mean to suggest that pedophilia was not a grave offense against children. He also acknowledged Tuesday that sexual abuse of children can be fatal: He knows of one victim personally who died by suicide after suffering abuse, he said.

&gt;**‚ÄùIt kills the spirit, it kills childhood,‚Äù Bucci said. ‚ÄúI was focusing on the fact that there is no future at all for an unborn child who is aborted, whereas a child who is molested, with a great deal of effort and prayer and therapy and medicine, can at least lead a life that can accomplish things.‚Äù**

Ah yes, after being sexually abused, just keep praying and take meds and at least accomplish something in life.  Never mind the total lack of quality and availability of mental health care in the US. What a fucking nimrod. 

&gt;**Bucci said he was the first person to report the Rev. William O‚ÄôConnell to the state police when they served together as priests in Bristol in the early 1980s. He did so anonymously, he said, but nothing was done about it.** O‚ÄôConnell, now dead, was eventually arrested and charged, but only after other victims came forward, Bucci said.

Pat on the back for doing the right thing, Bucci. FFS. 

&gt;After he spoke out about O‚ÄôConnell, Bucci said, the diocese at the time ostracized him for doing so. The retaliation lasted for years, he said.

&gt;Now, though, he said he is thankful for the leadership of [Bishop Thomas Tobin.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/01/providence-bishop-faces-backlash-for-homophobic-tweet/jZojkSukKqJnLjpD720bNL/story.html) 

&gt;*Bucci said he stands by his decision to deny Communion to lawmakers who voted to codify abortion rights in the state, and stood by the general proposition that abortion is worse than pedophilia.**

&gt;‚ÄùI do believe killing an innocent child is the worst possible sin,‚Äù Bucci said.

Abortion is *not* the killing of a child. 

&gt;But anyone who does either thing, in Bucci‚Äôs view, will pay for it.

&gt;Said Bucci, referring to the Bible‚Äôs teachings: ‚ÄúAnyone who gives scandal to one of my children, it‚Äôs better that they put the instrument for milling grain around their neck and throw themselves into the ocean.‚Äù

&gt;**Among those who bristled at Bucci‚Äôs comments in the TV interview was state Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, who was on the list of people no longer allowed to receive Communion at Sacred Heart. McEntee‚Äôs sister, Ann Hagan Webb, said she was molested by a former priest at the same parish. That priest is now dead. Inspired by her sister, McEntee pushed for legislation that expanded the statute of limitations to sue over child sexual abuse.**

&gt;McEntee said in a Twitter posting Monday: **‚ÄùFather Bucci should have come to the State House to listen to the heart-wrenching stories from victims of pedophilia. The injured voices I have heard have nearly had their lives destroyed. The ones we hear from are the lucky ones who are still alive.‚Äù**

&gt;Relayed those comments, Bucci said Tuesday: ‚ÄúI may not have been at the State House, but I heard about it from many people in Bristol. I don‚Äôt have to be convinced of the horrendous situation that all of these children endured.‚Äù",1581521193,fhefd5n

4128,Dorothy-Snarker,"Well, people who identity as Catholic is only at about 40% nowadays (used to be much higher). It is dying out, but it's still pretty strong. Still the largest denomination in the state. The younger generation is more likely to identify as atheist or non-practicing, but most politicians in the state are Catholics.

The vast majority of politicians in Rhode Island are Democrats but roughly *half* of them are anti-choice. A big reason this happens is because the Republican Party isn't very powerful here, so many conservatives will run as a Democrat (though strangely enough we've had a ton of Republican governors and such). 

As for why anti-choice laws are being passed through the country at a time when religiousness is at it's lowest, it's because televangelists in the 80s learned how to energize the their followers to become single issue votes, who now make up a huge portion if the Republican party. Most of the country, both people who identify as pro-choice and pro-life, actually most agree on how to deal with the abortion issue. Most people are against it on a personal level but believe it should be legal, at least to a certain point, such as within a certain time frame or the cases where the baby or mother's life is at risk or in the cases of rape and incest. It's the politicians and lobbist who are dividing us and making us feel divided, not our actual views (gun laws are similar, most people believe in some restriction but not outright banning of all guns).",1581549937,fhfrzw0

""What does ""Rhode Island"" mean?

The first mention of Rhode Island in writing (""isola di Rhode"") was made by explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 (he refers to an island near the mouth of Narragansett Bay which he compares to the Island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean). Some attribute the name to Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, who called it ""Roodt Eylandt,"" meaning ""red island"" (again because its red clay is similar to the Greek island of Rhodes). All State Name Origins

The first official reference to the island by the English is in these words ""Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Ile of Rods or Rhod-Island."" The earliest recorded English colonist text (by Roger Williams) refers to it as ""Ilande of the Rodes"" (without the ""h"").

The name ""Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations"" was adopted in the Royal Charter granted by King Charles I of England in 1633 (the complete name appears on Rhode Island's state seal; ""State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations"").""",1581558121,fhg42lf

4158,LilPeanutt,"&gt;WEST WARWICK, R.I. (WPRI) ‚Äî A West Warwick priest has created quite a stir after publicly declaring he would deny Holy Communion to all lawmakers who supported an abortion rights bill last year.

&gt;Fr. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church argued that he‚Äôs simply following the teachings of the Catholic religion.

&gt;‚ÄùThose are the teachings of the Catholic Church,‚Äù Bucci said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like those teachings, leave.‚Äù

&gt;Bucci sent out a flyer earlier this year urging churches to deny communion to all lawmakers who signed legislation codifying Roe v. Wade into Rhode Island law.

&gt;The flyer also encouraged churches not to allow the lawmakers to have any role within the parish, including being named a godmother or godfather.

&gt;The flyer left many lawmakers frustrated, especially those listed. Some are even calling for Bucci to retire, resign or be removed from his position.

&gt;‚ÄùThey keep pushing more and more parishioners away,‚Äù Rep. Julie Casimiro, D-North Kingstown, said. ‚ÄúThey pushed me away a long time ago.‚Äù

&gt;**Casimiro, who is on the list of lawmakers to be denied communion, argued a law providing women the right to choose doesn‚Äôt mean anyone is in favor of abortions. But Bucci feels otherwise.**

&gt;**‚ÄùYou know what that‚Äôs like? ‚ÄòI sell slaves at the market, but I‚Äôm against slavery,'‚Äù Bucci said.**

Time to retire, FFS.

&gt;**Casimiro said Bucci‚Äôs decision is becoming personal, saying he kicked Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee out of a funeral in December.**

&gt;**‚ÄùHe told her to shut up and get out,‚Äù Casimiro said.**

&gt;Bucci defended his actions and said while he does have personal problems with McEntee, that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs speaking out against her and the abortion legislation.

&gt;‚ÄùShe certainly is an agent of this change, she and the story of her sister, I think influence people and they sort of lost her reason, and I think a lot of the people do not know how extreme this bill is,‚Äù he said. (McEntee‚Äôs sister has said she was a victim of clergy sex abuse, and her story helped McEntee pass a new law extending the civil statute of limitations for child molestation.)

&gt;While previously defending his stance of withholding communion to pro-choice lawmakers, Bucci used an inflammatory analogy, saying pedophilia isn‚Äôt as bad as abortion because no one dies from sexual abuse.

&gt;**Bucci told WPRI 12 that while he stands by what he said, he wanted to clarify what he meant.**

&gt;**‚ÄùI should have phrased it: every child who is aborted dies, whereas a person who is abused can be vindicated,‚Äù Bucci explained.**

First of all, what? Secondly, CHILDREN aren‚Äôt aborted. 

&gt;Casimiro said Bucci made it clear he will not budge, so she‚Äôs calling upon the Catholic Church to do something about it.

&gt;Bucci said he believes abortion should be illegal, although he left open room for compromise.

&gt;‚ÄùIn my perfect world, it ends with making abortion legal in the case of rape, incest and indirect threat to a mother‚Äôs life,‚Äù he said.

Ok, you narcissistic, misogynist fossil. 

&gt;Bishop Thomas Tobin appeared to allude to the controversy in a [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/ThomasJTobin1/status/1227726386162475009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1227726386162475009&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wpri.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fwest-bay%2Fif-you-dont-like-those-teachings-leave-west-warwick-priest-speaks-out-amid-communion-controversy%2F) Wednesday evening:

4192,iandavid,"Holy shit, the statement released by Bishop Tobin this morning. He‚Äôs completely unapologetic, reaffirms the comparison of abortion to sexual abuse, claims that abortion ‚Äúexploits vulnerable women‚Äù (WTF‚ÄΩ), then urges the public to refrain from ‚Äúunhelpful, inflammatory rhetoric‚Äù, as though he didn‚Äôt just do that himself. That‚Äôs a big ol‚Äô heap of garbage right there. 

Full statement:

&gt; ‚ÄúIn the context of the present public discussion, it is important to affirm that both the sexual abuse of minors and abortion are horrific, immoral actions that have very serious, harmful consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúFirst, it is never acceptable to underestimate the harm caused by sexual abuse of minors. Sexual abuse, wherever and whenever it occurs, causes long-lasting, sometimes permanent and devastating harm to the victims/survivors, their families and the entire community. Allegations of sexual abuse must always be taken most seriously and every effort should be made to protect children and youth, to eliminate abuse, to prosecute abusers, and to offer assistance to those who have been harmed.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúBut, abortion is also a sinful, immoral act, an *‚Äúabominable crime.‚Äù* (Second Vatican Council) Abortion destroys innocent unborn life; *it exploits vulnerable women*; it diminishes family life; and it corrodes the moral fabric of society.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThere are no circumstances, personal or political, that justify the termination of unborn children. The Catholic Church has been very clear and consistent in condemning the evil of abortion, and we affirm that those who promote, support and approve abortion, including civic leaders, are responsible for having committed a grave evil in the sight of Almighty God.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúIn the current public discussion, *I urge all parties to refrain from unhelpful, inflammatory rhetoric*, and to reflect personally and prayerfully on the consequences of these grave matters. May we renew our efforts to protect life and promote the common good, especially for children and youth, and may God bless our commitment with wisdom, prudence, humility and charity.‚Äù

&gt;PROVIDENCE -- Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin released a statement Thursday morning after a group of lawmakers called on Tobin to ‚Äúsuspend‚Äù a West Warwick parish priest for his comments on pedophilia.

&gt;**Tobin did not address whether any action would be taken against Rev. Richard Bucci.**

&gt;Bucci, the pastor of Sacred Heart Church, was already in the news for his statements about denying Communion to lawmakers who last year voted to enshrine the right to abortion in state law. A flier was handed out to parishioners at his church listing lawmakers who wouldn‚Äôt be eligibile for Communion, as a result of their support for the law.

&gt;The heat was turned up higher when, in a Channel 10 interview, Bucci said unlike abortion, ‚Äúpedophilia doesn‚Äôt kill anyone.‚Äù Bucci later acknowledged he could have chosen his words better.

&gt;On Wednesday, a dozen state lawmakers ‚Äî and two clergy sex-abuse victims ‚Äî called on Tobin to ‚Äúsuspend‚Äù Bucci after at least two state representatives received letters at home from Bucci.

&gt;The Providence Diocese issued the following statement from Tobin early Thursday morning ‚Äúon the current discussion concerning sexual abuse of minors and abortion‚Äù:

&gt;‚ÄùIn the context of the present public discussion, it is important to affirm that both the sexual abuse of minors and abortion are horrific, immoral actions that have very serious, harmful consequences.

&gt;‚ÄùFirst, it is never acceptable to underestimate the harm caused by sexual abuse of minors. Sexual abuse, wherever and whenever it occurs, causes long-lasting, sometimes permanent and devastating harm to the victims/survivors, their families and the entire community. Allegations of sexual abuse must always be taken most seriously and every effort should be made to protect children and youth, to eliminate abuse, to prosecute abusers, and to offer assistance to those who have been harmed.

&gt;‚ÄùBut, abortion is also a sinful, immoral act, an ‚Äúabominable crime.‚Äù (Second Vatican Council) Abortion destroys innocent unborn life; it exploits vulnerable women; it diminishes family life; and it corrodes the moral fabric of society.

I had an abortion when I was 25 and I don‚Äôt recall it corroding the moral fabric of society. Anyhow...

&gt;‚ÄùThere are no circumstances, personal or political, that justify the termination of unborn children. The Catholic Church has been very clear and consistent in condemning the evil of abortion, and we affirm that those who promote, support and approve abortion, including civic leaders, are responsible for having committed a grave evil in the sight of Almighty God.

&gt;‚ÄùIn the current public discussion, I urge all parties to refrain from unhelpful, inflammatory rhetoric, and to reflect personally and prayerfully on the consequences of these grave matters. May we renew our efforts to protect life and promote the common good, especially for children and youth, and may God bless our commitment with wisdom, prudence, humility and charity.‚Äù

&gt;**Ann Hagan Webb, a clergy sex-abuse victim who called for Bucci‚Äôs suspension Wednesday, was disappointed with Tobin‚Äôs reaction.**

&gt;**‚ÄùHis language is telling,‚Äù she said. ‚Äù ‚ÄòSin‚Äô and ‚Äòabominable crime‚Äô for abortion, and ‚Äònever acceptable‚Äô for childhood sexual abuse.**",1581613136,fhhwic4

&gt; I haven't lived in this place very long so I don't have a leg to stand on with making him give me an eviction notice...not that I would want to, I don't like taking advantage of people. He's not willing to work with me because he has 4 rooms he rents out in his house, and he uses them to pay his mortgage so he can't afford to lose a months of payment, 

I'm not saying fuck your landlord over, but don't march over to crossroads as soon as you're a day late on rent. [Know your rights.](http://www.rils.org/documents/tenant_rights.pdf)

&gt;If you are more than 15 days behind in rent, the landlord can use a quick court process to try to evict you. Before the landlord starts a court case, s/he must give you a written notice demanding that you pay the rent. As long as you pay the rent within 5 days of the date on the notice, the landlord should not start an eviction case. If s/he does, you should go to court and tell the judge that you paid the rent. The judge should dismiss the case against you and you should win.

&gt;If you do not pay the rent within five days, the landlord will start an eviction case. The first notice you will have of the case is when you receive legal papers from a sheriff or constable.

So, assuming you need to pay rent on the 15th, that means the landlord can only give the final notice on March 1st. Then, you'll have 5 days until the landlord can officially file for eviction.So you're looking at March 6th when the first document even goes to the courthouse.

Anyway, you should immediately start looking for a new place, and also apply for SNAP, which should help you in the next three weeks until your paycheck.

Also, does the landlord actually live  in the house? And he rents out rooms?",1581640478,fhj8zzu

Do not leave your rental. Don't do it. I don't give a fuck how introverted you think you are.

Go to him right now and mention that you won't have your rent, but that you will pay him as soon as possible. You lost your job unexpectedly. You will take WHATEVER job you can in the meantime and pay him at least a portion as soon as possible. 

Do not go into all this stuff like you have here. You need him to be somewhat confident you will pay. And you will, but it's going to take time. Take the first job you can get, if you have a car signup for uber/lyft uber eats everything. Work somewhere for cash for the time being if you have to. Restaurants and local places in prov etc. If you're a tradesman of sorts-years ago when I was between jobs I'd go to home depot in the early morning and wait for work. I got a gig every time and I got paid cash that day. I had to work my ass off but it was usually good pay. There are a lot of guys who could just use a ""kid"" to help haul things on a jobsite and assist in general.

Do not leave your apartment. However uncomfortable you think it will be living there and owing him money, it will be worse on the street. 

If he insists on kicking you out -make him go threw with the eviction process. If he tries to fuck with you -threaten to call the cops. If it doesn't work then fucking call the cops.

1. You have a new job in two weeks (which means first paycheck in 4 weeks)
2. You live in a state with extremely tenant friendly laws (meaning, legally losing your home will take a lot of time and headache for the landlord, buying you time).
3. You have $22 - enough to last you if you eat ramen or other high calorie cheap foods (ie dollar menu)

Yes this is going to be uncomfortable as hell, but you will make it through, and this will harden your character and change the way you save and think about money in the future.

You need to tell your landlord you will be a couple weeks late on rent because you switched jobs and there is a small gap in paychecks. Then you need to spend all day everyday preparing for your new job and making sure you will be sharp and do well, you can also find easy temp work around town to fill the gap. Clean your clothing, study whatever you need to, get some rest, etc. Budget out your food money. Walk down the street and ask every company if they need help and your willing to work any job, no matter how minor. Go online and post in your neighborhoods Next Door forum and say you‚Äôre available to do annoying work like move stuff or clean or whatever for cash. Offer to do dishes at restaurants. Post on every forum online - Craigslist, etc.

&gt;If you are not behind in your rent and the landlord wants to evict you, s/he must first send you a written ""notice to quit"" which asks you to move out of your apartment. The notice must state the date on which you should move. To be legal, the date must be the date you normally would pay rent. The landlord must send you the notice far enough in advance as required by law. If you pay rent monthly, you must be given the notice 30 days before the date you need to leave. If you pay weekly, you must be given at least 10 days advance notice.

In other words, OP's landlord COULD just terminate the month-to-month lease, but he'd still need to give the OP 30 days notice. So if the landlord went that route, he would give the notice on the 15th, then OP is expected to move out on 3/15. Even then:

&gt;He cannot just order you to leave or change your lock. You will receive a Summons and Complaint served by a sheriff or constable. You will have 20 days from the day you receive the legal papers to answer the Complaint.

There would be a court date, then a final determination to evict. But hopefully OP would have it sorted before any court papers are even filed.

IMO, it's also a totally fair way to raise funds because as others have pointed out, trucks take a heavy toll on roads but don't pay RI a dime if they're registered out of state. You use the public service = you pay the tax.

People who say they'll make it a toll for everyone are idiots. I get that there's reason not to trust Rhode Island politicians but like... have you ever seen a regular toll booth? You would need a cash lane, and they're not putting in any of the infrastructure for that (how would a toll booth operator get to some of those places?). Not to mention it would basically cause a political armageddon.

Thats wrong

Every truck that rides through the state pays a fuel use tax, no matter where they bought the fuel, they log miles and pay tax to each state they used fuel in. Some get some funds back from the state they bought it in also. They use the IFTA ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fuel_Tax_Agreement ) to file and pay. Many states add a weight surcharge to the tax. 

The state could have used the IFTA to collect a surcharge on trucks for road repairs. It would have been better as there would have been no expensive gantries to build, and it would have hit all trucks driving on all roads in the state not just those going under gantries, and it would have been immediate- you would have been collecting from everyone the day after it went in place with no shortfall delays like we have now waiting for gantries.

&gt;From cosmetics, ski wax, and non-stick frying pans to waterproof jackets, take-out food containers, and stain-resistant fabrics, toxic PFAS ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù are found in hundreds of consumer products, in our water, and now in the blood of nearly every American. In fact, PFAS chemicals have been found in 44% of tested water systems in Rhode Island.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;In the new movie *DARK WATERS*, Mark Ruffalo plays real-life unlikely hero Rob Bilott ‚Äî a chemical company lawyer who turned the tables to sue DuPont for polluting the area around its West Virginia plant. Until then, no one outside the chemical industry had heard of PFAS chemicals, but Bilott discovered that the companies that made them knew they were toxic all along, yet still put them in hundreds of widely used products.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;What are the dangers of PFAS chemicals and what can be done about them here in Rhode Island?

The nail in the coffin was when there were department store mergers. There were redundant Filene's (at the time in the Warwick Mall this would have been in the current Macy's locations; oddly enough due to another merger circa 2006 between Macy's and Filene's, Macy's moved out of the southern anchor and moved into the Filene's location, in the process the third floor was abandoned).    
    
The Rhode Island Mall Filene's branch was closed circa 1997 (a family member was working temp at the time). The series of events after effectively doomed the mall to a slow death. Management razed the northern third of the mall and placed what was supposed to be a 'temporary' construction wall in it's place. There were talks that Walmart and Kohls was to open up into the mall but those plans never occurred. One by one the remaining occupants either closed shop on their own or were denied a lease extension (In the later day the holdouts were the Sliver dragon,  First Place Sports, GNC, and Sears). It had to be around May of 2011 when the mall could be considered dead when interior access was shuttered (sears ended up placing their own partition wall where the storefront gates were).

4586,AdmiralEllis,"While it's a Rhode Island pastime to hate on Rhode Island, I'll give you the sunny side. The summers aren't too hot, the winters aren't too cold, and no season is particularly long. Providence is a great little city and if you want something bigger you're an hour from Boston and three from New York. If you want something smaller and more quaint you have plenty of options. I'm sure as a Texan those distances mean nothing to you, and within that radius you can find an outrageous range of town types and sizes, and attractions. Most of New England and some of New York state is within reach of an easy day trip, including Cape Cod.

The taxes and prices aren't too high compared to our immediate neighbor states, though I'd admittedly guess they're higher than Texas. You do get decent transit and such for your buck, though- a workable little airport and good Amtrak service plus, again, plenty of nearby options. I think as far as New England goes Rhode Island is in the best position. And while we may not be the prettiest state (Maine probably takes the regional cake), we've got plenty of beautiful, and also historic places.

If you're really interested in moving here I think I'd do further research. You don't mention a profession, and while the job market isn't terrible (there are always places hiring), it isn't exactly booming. Lots of people work out of state, like in Boston. The housing market is high, but it's high everywhere and again, we're less expensive than our neighbors. Northeasterners have a stereotype of being sarcastic and cold, but it's a small state and I'd like to think that tempers that a little. You're likely to run into people you know if you live here long enough, and bizarrely you will suddenly begin to run into Rhode Islanders no matter where you are.

Tough to say. I will say there are beautiful places to go ‚Äî beaches are beautiful, there are some cute historical towns, Providence is a cute little city.

In terms of the weather, I‚Äôd say Chicago and Rhode Island are pretty comparable. Chicago is windier, and the coldest days are colder, but Rhode Island gets a bit more snow with the nor‚Äôeasters. So, I‚Äôd say it averages out as to which is ‚Äúworse.‚Äù

4609,kfl85,"I posted this before, We moved here from Texas about 4 years ago for my Wife's job at the Hospital and we've enjoyed our time here overall. RI will not be our last stop, but its been a cool place to live so far. PM me if you have other questions.

I'll try and give you an unbiased opinion, I'm From FL but have lived all over the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest and have traveled pretty extensively around the US and World. 

The Good: 

* RI is a very pretty state, lots of water (which will be quite a departure from CO) 
* Outdoor activities are very accessible and easy to get to (hiking/biking/water activities/Mountains/beach/skiing -albeit east coast skiing) 
* Great food and drink scene (lousy Mexican/no Cuban but the restaurants and beer in the state is legit) 
* Healthcare is good, if you have good insurance (lots of local hospitals with great care as well as easy access to Boston if you need something extremely specialized)
* Getting around New England is pretty easy, compared to Denver Traffic Providence is a joke. Its pretty cool to be able to be in the mountains hiking in the morning and be on the beach in the afternoon for sunset

The So So:

* People are a bit of a debate here, RI can be extremely insular depending on the part of the state you live in, the state can have a very small town feel which can be both good and bad.   I've found New Englanders to be harder to get to know and be friends with than Southerners and less ""outgoing"" than people from the West, That being said this has been my experience and yours may differ depending on where you live in the State
* Politically the leadership is ""Democrat"" but you'll find they tend to be more on the Conservative side. The Cities and towns around the Providence Metro are very progressive so its probably not a big departure from the Denver Metro
* Real Estate is heavily dependent on City, if you're moving from the Denver Metro area you'll find the prices are probably comparable but the tax will be a lot higher. That being said I bought my house in the Edgewood Neighborhood in Cranston and I live 2 blocks from the water, less than a mile from our little town center, and 3 miles from downtown Providence and I paid about $300K (granted the house needed work) 2 years ago. Prices in my neighborhood are around \~$300-450K mark for a 4/1 or 3/2 depending on condition of the home  

The not so Good: 

* Schools in the state are very City dependent and for the most part the school systems aren't that great unless you live in East Greenwich or Barrington (Cranston and Kingstown are okay, but avoid Providence at all costs)  
* Taxes here (and in New England as a whole) are very high. You'll find your Property Tax is going to be 2-3 times higher here, there is an excise tax on cars that is very high, Sales tax is 7%, Taxes are also very city dependent (we have 44 cities in state the size of Houston TX) so make sure you research each one carefully 
* Jobs are a hot topic of debate here, RI is traditionally more of a Blue Collar state. That being said if you aren't in Healthcare, Tourism, or some sort of Service oriented job finding a job can be tough. Boston has a much more diverse Job market but RI is trying. I personally work remotely for a Tech company so the best bet is to come with a Job if you can...
* The state as a whole is pretty corrupt and there is a lot of nepotism in state jobs (its a small state so everyone tends to know everyone). The corruption goes back to when the Mob ruled a lot of the state, there are some fun podcasts on this (Check out Crimetown).",1582021665,fi0181k

4615,PM_WHAT_U_GOT,"As someone that lives right across the border, I‚Äôd figure that I should build on the comments here with a few Massachusetts pros/cons vs Rhode Island. For one, the property taxes are a bit cheaper compared to what we were looking at in RI for similar houses. It‚Äôs still much, much cheaper than what you would see in NY: I pay less than half what my uncle does in the Rochester area. Public schools here are also generally good. I‚Äôve been told from gun enthusiast friends that MA gun laws are much more strict than RI. Coming from Texas, that may or may not be an important factor. I think our income tax is slightly higher, our sales tax slightly lower. But they‚Äôre pretty close, so don‚Äôt quote me on that. Roads are terrible pretty much all of New England.

Also, Massachusetts residents don‚Äôt have that weird ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drive out of my state‚Äù thing that Rhode Islanders do (what‚Äôs with that anyway?), but you‚Äôll find that New Englanders in general are pretty similar in personality in being somewhat insular.

Close border cities/towns would be Attleboro, North Attleborough, and Seekonk. Any of those would be about 15 minutes from Providence without traffic if that‚Äôs where you work. Reno both and Dighton are a bit further, but more rural if you‚Äôre looking for something more quiet.

The commute to Providence in this part of the state is easy. The daily commute into Boston in much more of a chore, but many of my neighbors do it. It‚Äôs roughly an hour each way on the commuter rail.",1582027321,fi05n6o

Great sailing and if you move to western RI some beautiful hiking.  

It has a quirky music and theater and art scene which my family loves. Great food thanks to JWU.

4622,CetaceanSensation,"My recommendation would be to not move to Rhode Island. I've lived in several different parts of the country. Simply, RI is one of the last states I'd ever recommend moving to. 

It is comprised of a highly insular group of locals and a highly insular group of 2nd homers/vacationers. 

Its state political apparatus has been hollowed out and used for most of its recent history to serve the interests of the mafia and the wealthy who use the state as a summer home. 

It has archaic, puritanical laws. 

It has the worst drivers in the country and traffic is terrible. 

The price of everything is grossly inflated.

It has the general NYC/Boston social code of rudeness and apathy without any real counterculture to balance. 

The beaches are either horribly overcrowded or private.

Jobs and apartments are scarce.

The redeeming qualities are the ocean, Providence, the rural/agricultural towns, proximity to civilization, and I guess the food. Honestly, if you live there without being from there, you're taking some really low odds of fitting in or enjoying it. And if you don't it doesn't have the same internal variability that most states do. You won't be able to just go out and find the places and people where you feel at home - it's very limited in what it offers. I'd recommend almost any other state.",1582029132,fi07eu2
4623,Davecasa,"Rhode Islander for my entire 33 years, but I travel a lot. I agree with pretty much everything here. I'll add the reason RI is so much more appealing to be than anywhere else I've been:

You can live in a quiet place in the woods, while still being only 10-15 minutes from grocery stores, restaurants, beaches, marinas, I95, and right in between Boston and New York. You're not going to get the acreage you could in more rural places, but it sure is convenient.",1582029486,fi07s9o
4624,ilikerocks19,"Well, I can offer your perspective on Houston if you'd like! It's a fast growing city, essentially if you want a job here in any sense you can find it. Medical and Oil and Gas are the two majors here and both are centered in the downtown(ish) area.  
Pros: FANTASTIC food and I cannot stress this enough. I've traveled most the world and can say pretty confidently that Houston has the best and most diverse food. Winters here are nice because, well, it's not winter. It's kinda fun when your relatives are complaining about -13 degree weather and you're sitting outside in a light jacket drinking a beer. It also has a great art scene, major concerts, and lots of shopping if you're into that.

cons: traffic, omg the traffic. I cannot stress this enough, your WHOLE life will be based around traffic. Houston likes to break everything up into neighborhoods and loops. There's the 610 loop that is just referred to as ""the loop"" and living inside this loop is insanely expensive. To give #s to that comment, a 1100 sq/ft house with no backyard or garage on a busy road will probably cost you $500-700k. And the taxes you pay inside the loop are equally outrageous. This drives everyone outside the loop where you can get a 2500 sq/ft house for $350-550K BUT your commute just went from 15 mins to an hour. Your dinner plans, work plans, meeting up with friends plans, airport travel, roadtrips, doctors appointments etc all need to be catered around Houston traffic which is bad from 6am-930am and then 2pm-7pm. 

Another con is the flooding and the heat. You can't even be strategic when it floods because it floods in a different area each time; it could be light rain in west houston and spring branch (2 miles away) could have 4' of water in their homes. The streets randomly flood, cars get totaled or damaged constantly, homes gets completely wrecked constantly, it's really a mess. Hurricane Harvey which was one of the most intense hurricanes in the US paled in comparison to tropical storm imelda that put homes under 8' of water. There's just no rhyme or reason to the destruction. And the heat.... by July you're miserable, you can never get cool, hour electric bill is astronomical and the only air you can get is AC in your office building and then the heat just keeps going until November. And it's not just heat, it's a wet, extremely humid heat. You're constantly drenched. It just really wears on you.",1582030069,fi08f41

Most of my neighbors here do the commute into Boston every day, and the commuter rail can be pricey and a long commute. Providence traffic isn‚Äôt that bad, but Boston can be awful, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to be commuting anywhere in RI to Boston in a car every day.

If you ultimately land a job in or close to Boston, you‚Äôre not going to be happy commuting from Providence or Cranston every day. When we first moved here from VA, my wife didn‚Äôt have a job, and we assumed she would be working out of Boston. She ended up instead working in southern MA then Pawtucket, and the commute from Weymouth turned into a chore.

Providence is a pretty hip small city. There‚Äôs a lot of great restaurants, and the cost of living is a fraction of what you‚Äôd see in Boston if you guys don‚Äôt have kids and are looking to rent in a city.

As for outdoor stuff, there‚Äôs plenty of that here. Where I am, I‚Äôm about 20-30 minutes from a marina, 20 minutes to a beach, 40 minutes to a good beach, about 1 hr to Wachusett for skiing, about 3 hours for good skiing, and about 2 hours from the Appalachian Trail if you‚Äôre into backpacking. There‚Äôs plenty of hiking, boating, surfing, fishing, skiing, etc. The only downside is that like Chicago, our summers are *short*.

I think I'd only put Louisiana, Alaska, North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming ahead of it in likelihood the average person will deeply regret it. Maybe NH, WV, AB, MS, and FL, but I still think those offer enough options to a person that they can at least escape the state's general culture if it ends up not suiting them. In RI you are absolutely trapped in the thing that is RI.",1582043712,fi0s7vb

4692,chuckstaton,"If you're outdoorsy people who like the seasons, I think RI will be perfect for you. One of the things I'm consistently in awe of, is how much diversity there is in the state's atmosphere in such a short radius. Providence is an excellent city and a great hub. It has a small city vibe in some areas, and that's a small piece of the pie in terms of diversity. I actually live on Main Street in Warren, a small suburb of Providence. My house is about a 14 minute drive to downtown Providence - but it's basically a very small town. I took these pictures all in downtown Warren: https://www.instagram.com/p/BaukEgvlg-E/  
So I'm situated in an area of RI called ""The East Bay."" This refers to Warren/Bristol/Portsmouth/Barrington (and Newport I guess?). It's full of coastal and farming communities. I right on the East Bay Bike Path, which is about 15 miles long, and goes from Providence to Bristol. It used to be an old railroad I believe, and they converted into a bike and walking path. I love it. It's excellent, and it goes through VERY varied terrain including beaches, bridges, over the bay, through a lot of wooded and downtown-y areas. Here are some pictures: https://www.traillink.com/trail-gallery/east-bay-bike-path/  
On top of the bike path, which to me is a great source of doing things outside, since it's so long and goes through so many communities - like I said, the scenery is extremely varied around the state.  
Providence - Providence is an amazing small city. I go to Boston fairly often, and NYC here and there - and the difficulties of parking, as well as getting in and out do not exist in Providence. Providence is obviously a smaller city - but with tons of things to do and restaurants (we'll get to that). So the city vibe is there, especially with events like PVD Fest and weekend summer vibes in Providence are pretty perfect (and I have much more to say about the city if you're interested, but I'm kind of covering different outdoor possibilities). So that's one area.  
In Warren, we have a small town beach, right across from a very fun town park with a basketball court, baseball diamond, and a band shell where they have concerts and food truck events. This is a very small version of these two things but they're great in a small town setting. Nearby in Bristol is a great coastal community with the oldest Fourth of July in the US - it's honestly insane. I grew up in Bristol (which borders Warren, so they share a public school system) and I went to the fireworks and parade every year. It's overwhelmingly insane. Imagine a small town that gets overrun like it's Disney world for three days in the summer. Bristol also holds Colt State Park, which is a monstrous state park that also sits on the bay. This is a great park atmosphere - the ground is mostly flat, there's a ton of sport possibilities (baseball, volleyball, soccer, basketball, skateboarding, etc), beach spots, eating spots, outdoor barbecue and party spots, kite flying areas, etc etc in Colt State. Doesn't have deep woods, this is more of a huge ""relaxing afternoon"" park on the water. It also borders some farmland, as well as downtown Bristol, and the East Bay Bike Path runs through it. Looks to be 464 acres so pretty big park.  
And I would say - that's one specific type of park in RI. There's an amazing park in East Greenwich that is full of woods, and horse trails, and it also borders the beach. My girlfriend and I actually went hiking a few times last summer in new trail areas that were absolutely incredible. The parks are many, and they are huge.  
I think for me (growing up around the East Bay) the seafaring community is a big part of it. Providence has a lot of areas on the water, but a lot of the surrounding communities will REALLY embrace that. We have a downtown on the water in Warren that's excellent but small - Newport RI is kind of the place to go for that beach-y life. I do enjoy it (my girlfriend and I stayed in Newport just last week) but they are ALL IN. There are a ton of big beaches in RI (https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/travel-guide/g9528618/rhode-island-beaches/) and in Newport, you can be near a bunch of these beaches and also be in the big historic coastal community they have around their boardwalk area. It's essentially a huge area of docks that has been turned into upscale restaurants and shops (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g0978-d290582-Reviews-Bowen_s_Wharf-Newport_Rhode_Island.html) across from a traditional boardwalk area you'd see on the Jersey Shore - GREAT summer vibes. Along with those areas of Newport - they have cliff walk (https://www.discovernewport.org/things-to-do/cliff-walk/) and the mansions, which are pretty incredible, especially around Christmas (https://www.discovernewport.org/things-to-do/mansions/).  
Being part of New England, RI is super historic, which is really fun as well for outdoorsy events, based in those areas. Farms are really big around here too - in the Fall we do a lot of orchard-y, Autumn farm stuff. 
If you want to be outside, by the water, in a small town downtown area, in a park, hiking, playing sports, going to a city, going to the beach, campgrounds, going to farms, historic places, etc etc etc - all of it is easy to do. Like I said, I live on Main Street in Warren. I walk outside and I'm in a downtown area. The bike path is behind my house. Downtown Providence is a 14 minute drive. Colt State Park is a 10 minute drive. Downtown Bristol is a 10 minute drive. There are tons of farms, trails, beaches, etc are all in within 45 minutes of where I am, and the same goes for most populated RI areas. In terms of outdoor options - I'd say we exceed with beaches and waterfront living, as well as farming in the rural areas. But everything I mentioned is easily accessibly, and extremely common. Tons of choices.",1582047238,fi0yj5l
4693,chuckstaton,"That being said - it does get cold for the winter. Decemebers are mild, and my girlfriend and I took a 45-minute walk outside just yesterday, by the water.

The only thing I can think of is imagine nothing working right, then imagine that the people in charge of the things aren't working right blame you for it. What kind of frustration that would cause.

I will tell you some little personal anecdotes I tell people when comparing RI to other states, namely Texas.

I was living in NY, bought a new car there and registered it in NY. I had to move to California about 2 years later and when I went to re-register my car in CA, I had to pay a shit ton of fees, have a special test done to my car (that I had to pay for) but I was finally able to register it after a few appointments and about a 2 hour wait at the DMV.

About 2ish years later, I had to go overseas and while I was there my family was going to stay in RI near my parents. During that time my wife needed to renew her license and we had to re-register the car again (the same one from NY).

When I went to register the car, I did the vin check thingy and brought my CA registration. Was that good enough for RI? No it was not, after a 2 hour wait they needed my bill of sale. Why did they need my bill of sale? Because they had to see if when I bought the car in NY almost 5 years prior that I paid the appropriate sales tax, guess what? I didn't... I had to pay an additional $700 over what I paid in NY (which I was told after another hour long wait, in the special tax line).

I said fuck that and re-registered the car via internet in CA. Giving my RI address which they allowed because of my line of work.

I bring up my wife's license because during the same initial trip. She still had her RI license and was just going to renew it with our new address. A month later she gets her license in the mail. Her picture, our address, but a different name, license number and date of birth.

So she and I go back and they actually yell at her, saying it was her fault as she stood there calmly. They did send her the correct license after another month though.

So after my time overseas (another 2 years or so), I am moved to Texas. Registration comes up, I bring my CA registration and go to the DMV. NO WAIT. I go right up to the counter. Give them my old registration, my new address (with a utility bill), and my license.

5 minutes later I have everything I need and I am done.

To move closer to our aging families, we decided to move back. A moving company came, picked up our stuff in TX and brought it to RI. It was around Thanksgiving time. The moving company had our stuff in storage with a local RI company. I was supposed to contact them when we were ready for it. I worked for the government at the time and they contracted the moving companies for us on both ends of the trip.

When I contacted them they told me they couldn't deliver my things for about two months. I asked if there was any way to do it sooner since that would be after Christmas and I had children, the woman I was speaking to said she would ask her manager.

So I hear this guy in the background say, 'What the fuck!"" and he takes the phone and starts yelling and swearing at me. Like I'm fucked up for even asking if they could move up the delivery date. What made it worse is that this guy sounded like your regular Rhode Islander, full moron accent going (for those from RI, imagine the radio car commercials), just a stream of expletives.

So I just called the government office that did the contracting for these moves (closest was located in MA), told them what happened and suddenly we were able to get our things two days later.

While not every business I have dealt with has been like that moving company, every time I have to deal with the state government, I feel lucky if it goes even half as well as I described above.

I usher at a theater, and we need to take a Fire Marshall's class in order to be certified for ""crowd management"". In this context, crowd control is knowing the procedures to evacuate a venue in case of emergency.

On the other hand, given what we know about RIDOT, diluting what little big picture transit thinking RIPTA is capable of is quite unlikely to improve transit.  RIDOT knows enough about fashionable urban thinking to claim that a single agency operating transit and configuring roads will be better able to implement exclusive bus lanes.  But that is BS until we see a loosening of the ironclad rule in effect so far:  Bike lanes or bus lanes can only be installed where surplus road space already exists and they are least needed.

I was looking for it because someone I've talked to previously has told me how the Chinese Mob funds a lot of the restaurants in this area, and I couldn't remember if that was one of them.

But I still think that once the rumor starts floating around, whatever it may be, seems to stick and get passed by word.

Google did autofill ""seven moons restaurant prostitution"" which means it has been searched enough for it to be recognized.",1582650511,fiqrns2

Keep in mind that while the driving test is pass fail, it is graded. Meaning if you can't parallel park but can do everything else properly you will still pass.

The one thing I will mention is the k turn. If you don't know how to do a proper k turn while using your blinkers properly, Google it.

The only instant fails are collisions and no seatbelt afaik. The other things you can lose points on is not checking mirrors when changing lanes. Even if you know you checked them out of the corner of your eye. Exaggerate it with head movement so they can tell you checked.",1582672675,firwtdk

5342,FailingComic,"While he may be doing well currently, He was doing well 4 years ago as well and bowed out. I honestly don't think he has any aspirations of being a president. Hes good at touring and the younger crowd like him sure. No one thinks he can actually win it though which is why he bowed out and let Hillary take it. 

&amp;#x200B;

His age also plays a factor. Being 78 almost 79 puts him over the average US life expectancy already. I also believe that someone who is capable of making such sweeping changes should have to live with the changes they made. Based on his age he could fuck all of us and never have to deal with the ramifications.  


Finally the guy simply doesn't get things passed. The last time he had a bill pass that was turned into law was in 2014.... 6 years ago. I think that while the stuff he talks about is good, he doesn't need to be a president to do it.   


Now maybe all of what I said is bullshit. I slept through school and TBH I don't pay attention to much when it comes to politics because every person that gets voted in has some good with the bad and generally I would be happy either way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im also not a socialist at all. I believe that you should support yourself and not ask for handouts. I am for minimum wage increases as you should be able to live so long as you are working. Im just not down for paying for Bimbo Suzy to go to LSU so she can slut around while getting a degree in art that shes never going to use or pay for XYZ person to sit at home because they are fat enough that they qualify for disability. Stuff like this already goes on and it pisses me off. I just flat out don't think we should be giving handouts to everyone that's not actively looking to improve themselves at the same time to actually make the world a better place. Maybe that's the wrong way to look at it and you can try to open my eyes if you want but I work hard and don't think it would be fair to work hard and suddenly get paid less because some other people want to go to college and I don't  


The bottom line is that even if Bernie gets in and gets a lot of socialist stuff passed (which I doubt he will) due to the way our system works id anticipate it getting repealed later on. Most of his supporters I would assume are just people with student loan debt. I would anticipate if he got free college passed he would also want to wipe all the student loan debt and I doubt that would have a positive impact on our short term economy.",1582685458,fisih5a

I own a premay sample machine gun on my FFL in MA a ww2 German mp40. I payed 8,800 dollars for it when it, when it should‚Äôve only cost 2,500 max. There reason for that is because of a Amendment that was snuck in in the middle of the night in April of 1986 called the Hughes Amendment. 

Even though someone looking to buy one has to go through the NFA process has to send in

1. Two sets of finger prints 
2. A passport photo
3. A 200 dollar exercise tax
4. Send notice to your police chief
5. Wait 6-9 months for approval 
6. Apply for written permission if you want to take it out of state.

Between 1934 and 1986 legal machine guns were used in 3 incidents. Two were self defense shootings, and 1 was a police officer who killed his wife and her secret lover.

Now that law will never get off of the books unless a judge strikes it down because even when  the GOP controlled both chambers and had trump, no politicians wants to be the one to repeal the ban because it‚Äôs so socially taboo.

Now the anti gunners want to do the same thing with a ‚Äúassault weapons ban‚Äù.

Ultimately I and so many others just want to be left alone, but the actions of a few jack asses are ruining it for all of us, even when mass shootings are statistically rare.

they're dumbasses for trying to save a buck by manufacturing their electronic equipment in Chinese slave labor conditions instead of manufacturing locally and paying a slightly larger up-front cost to reduce engineering change turnaround time, eliminate travel cost, and guarantee line reliability. Any one of a thousand easily-foreseeable possibilities can instantly wipe out the alleged savings of remote manufacturing, not just coronavirus.

unfortunately cost savings are just the excuse used to pitch this garbage to management and the real reason engineering departments manufacture in China is so they can be employed for an extra 2 years to move everything stateside to China and then when the line fails they can be employed for an extra 2 more years while moving all the shit back stateside",1582924503,fj1oriu

5721,iquitrust,"that's called globalism and there are no conservatives who are in favor of globalism. That's not capitalism. Capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. Conservatives are in favor of retaining local manufacturing capabilities in case of war, natural disaster, or other forces that threaten supply chains (i.e. disease outbreak).

the people you are talking about who are in favor of globalism are called ""neo-conservatives"" and literally everybody who is not a neo-conservative hates them. Except maybe Democrats. There are no neocons I'm aware of who were born after 1964

neoconservatism is the polar opposite of what modern conservatives believe. It's more in-line with the Democrat party than the Republican party. Pat Buchanan called neoconservatism ""a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology"" 

If Mattielo is a Republican in the shoes of a Democrat as you claim (he's no Republican in my book) then neocons are Democrats pretending to be Republicans",1582925720,fj1qrjg

&gt; In an interview earlier this year, Mattiello, a Cranston Democrat, questioned why the state would want political maps to be drawn by people who aren‚Äôt elected by the voters.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúPlease explain why,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou want to pick someone else that the public doesn‚Äôt like as well?‚Äù

&gt;The current system appears to work well, Mattiello said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear one complaint about the last redistricting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAre we always looking for a solution to what‚Äôs not broken because someone else wants access to power?‚Äù
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Ruggerio, a North Providence Democrat, agreed, saying he doesn‚Äôt see what value an independent commission would bring to the redistricting process. ‚ÄúRedistricting is a political process,‚Äù he said.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; But Common Cause‚Äôs Marion contended that *legislative leaders have often had redistricting plans challenged in court over the past half century*. He said **they‚Äôve had to redraw district boundaries and spent $1 MILLION defending unconstitutional districts**. ‚ÄúSo there is increasing evidence that an independent commission would do a better job of drawing maps that are upheld in court,‚Äù he said.",1583019231,fj4xgd9

For retail liquor stores, I've found Haxton's liquors to have the best selection. They typically have a few bottles of Sap House Meadery, Moonlight, Danks Mjod, and maybe one or two other rotating brands.

For taprooms that I know of, you have:

- Greenwich Cove Meadery in Coventry
- Crave Meadery just over the border in Blackstone MA. 
- 1634 in MA 
- Nordic Moon Meadery in Connecticut 
- Sap House Meadery in NH
- Ancient Fire Mead &amp; Cider in NH
- Moonlight Meadery in NH

I haven't tried 1634 or Ancient Fire so not sure how good they are. The others are pretty good, with the exception of Moonlight which is *phenomenal*.

5850,Blacksheep01,"&gt; If you want a challenge I want to know why on god‚Äôs green earth RI has South Kingstown, North Kingstown, Kingston, and West Kingston. 

I'm originally from South Kingstown, and while I can't speak to the origin of double namings with different spellings,  there is a difference here between ""towns"" and ""villages"" that applies across the state. You might know this already, but I'll respond with what I know for the OP. South Kingstown is the name of an actual town, within South Kingstown there are 11 smaller villages and two of those villages are Kingston (where URI is located) and West Kingston, the village that's well...to the west of it, where APC (now Schneider Electric) and the Amtrak station are. Other villages in that town are Matunuck, East Matunuck, Green Hill, Perryville, Peace Dale and Wakefield etc., all within the bounds of the town of South Kingstown.

This model is duplicated throughout the state, which causes a confusing mess for newcomers and, as I've seen sometimes, even longtime residents who are just used to calling places by whatever name they grew up with, like Chepachet is a village in Glocester and Arctic is a village in West Warwick. Worse, some villages actually straddle two different towns, so if you live in the village of Saunderstown, your actual town could be either Narragansett or North Kingstown!",1583024846,fj55qu3

Woonsocket-the armpit of RI if you live there you are probably still stuck in the last century. A trip to Providence in way to far.

Cranston/Johnston/North Providence -known as predominantly Italian communities, big hair, thick accents etc ... makes me think of the jersey shore cast, especially Pauly D who needs to get a different haircut, it‚Äôs time. 

Warwick- the shittiest beach town ever, and of course the airport that no one wants to live near. It was semi-cool back when Rocky Point was around (amusement park) but just like everything else, it went to shit.

West Warwick/Coventry- a the evil  step sisters of Warwick. Absolutely nothing I can even say it‚Äôs good for, and the only reason someone has to go there is if they live there. 

Barrington/Bristol/warren- nice waterfront, nice restaurants, but if you live here there is a catch !!Metacom ave is the worst! And most people will not like to go over the two bridges to 1) providence 2) Portsmouth. And chances are you have some kind of Portuguese in your blood. 

Portsmouth/Middletown/Newport - only two ways  onto the island and tit cost money  to go over the Newport bridge . Nice homes and nightlife definitely summer towns , st pats parade is fun  not to many complaints about Newport. 

Central Falls /Pawtucket- ah yes good old Pawtucket, my hometown.  What a shit hole it‚Äôs become for both towns . Growing up it was predominantly Cape Verdean, French, Portuguese, Irish and Polish... now it‚Äôs a tiny  Central America. 

Burriville/Smithfield/Cumberland/Lincoln - where former residents of Pawtucket and Central Falls now live. 

North and south Kingston/ Wakefield/Narragansett- a nice mix of college towns and summer homes , a lot of all year rounders. Pretty nice but very pricey.

Sciruate/Foster/Gloucester/chepachet- good for country drives, Rednecks., but no real reason to go there but very quiet they do have a cool art fest every year.

&gt;""There is only one soccer league in the U.S. that could stimulate any sizable amount of visitors to come from outside of the city and that's MLS,"" Zimbalist said. ""When you are talking about people coming in to restaurants and hotels and Airbnb, that's the only way you could get any economic benefit from it.""

&gt;Of course, whether any professional sports plan makes sense depends on the level of public subsidies needed. If a team were willing to play in a lightly modified McCoy Stadium, then potentially even a minor league soccer outfit would be worth the effort.

The 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome. A cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, an additional 60 cases on 22 February, and Italy's first deaths reported on the same day.

As of late February, Italy was hit harder than anywhere else in the EU by the outbreak, and is the country with the third-highest number of positive cases, as well as deaths, in the world. Eleven municipalities in northern Italy have been identified as the epicentres of the two main Italian clusters and placed under quarantine.

The general public has to be weary of all asymptomatic reports. There is little time for peer review in a time like this, and reports are rushed out without scrutiny. DPH is not going to alert the public that they are at risk of asymptomatic transmission because it simply hasn't been proven. They are not incompetent nor are they lying.. See below...

A letter published in [*The New England Journal of Medicine*](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468) on January 30 described a similar case. It reported that a woman from Shanghai, who experienced no symptoms, had passed the infection to a German man.

The authors of the letter write that ‚ÄúThe fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of \[SARS-CoV-2\] infection may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.‚Äù

However, it transpired that the woman had, in fact, experienced mild symptoms, including muscle pain and fatigue. The authors had not managed to speak directly with the woman before the material was released.",1583162206,fj9xyt5

Those who came into contact with the infected person should *ideally* self-isolate for 14 days, and RIDOH should have stated as much. That's not fear-mongering; it's sensibly taking measures to avoid widespread transmission so those 20% that *do* get a severe case have a lower chance of contracting it.

This information is why I didn't bother looking and, turns out, I was correct. So, it sounds like I do actually know what is going around me.

As for the country going to shit, I tried to warn people about it when I first started seeing it happen back in 2009. I mean, I was aware before then, but that's when I became aware of how deep  we were with the surveillance state. You see, I worked in the Department of Defense for some time and actually got to test some of the programs involved. Do you even know about PRISM? Stingray? The hacked voting machines? The gerrymandered elections? MK-Ultra? The Information Awareness Office? The Five Eyes? The legalization of propaganda through the NDAA? How about the really crazy (and obviously fake) stuff like the occult?

It is actually a good part of why I went into a deep depression for around four years: no one listened. I couldn't work anymore because I didn't want to contribute to the what was going on. This put me in a very tough spot, having to start over entirely, as I was afraid to even work in research because I didn't want it to be used to contribute to this monstrosity. The harsh lesson was that no matter how you formulate information you cannot keep people from  misusing. As such, what you offer humanity must be decided based upon what the public consciousness is ready for. For, as we have seen, Snowden came out and spoke out. Hong Kong, Venezula, and Peutro Rico are fighting back.  Tesla cleaned up Flint and Trump has rustled the democratic party into thinking change can actually happen. All of these show that my fears, revolution or police state.. or worse, while founded in a lot of reliable information, for the most part, did not come to pass. Even if it does and this country is shifting dramatically into a horrifying direction, this is not something I, or anyone, can stop. Even the Buddha can only point at the moon and Christ was mounted on a cross. This is the lesson my years of suffering in utter despair about the world has taught me so, at least, take it into consideration.

To conclude, I will continue to filter what I view to be viable to me and those I am involved with because, ultimately, it has proven the right thing to do. I will write about what I think is of greatest service and not give a shit about your gantries. In this way, I am of the greatest service I can provide. For, as the prayer goes: ""Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.""

&gt;Smith College economist Andrew Zimbalist, who worked for the General Assembly analyzing the PawSox stadium plans, said he hasn't seen evidence that soccer below the MLS level in this country is worth public investment.

&gt;""There is only one soccer league in the U.S. that could stimulate any sizable amount of visitors to come from outside of the city and that's MLS,"" Zimbalist said. ""When you are talking about people coming in to restaurants and hotels and Airbnb, that's the only way you could get any economic benefit from it.""

&gt;Of course, whether any professional sports plan makes sense depends on the level of public subsidies needed. If a team were willing to play in a lightly modified McCoy Stadium, then potentially even a minor league soccer outfit would be worth the effort.

Yes the legal thing to do is slow down.

In real life the slow drivers cause the accidents. For now it is safer to join the sea of dip shits and try to be as safe as you can within the dip-shittery.    

What we need is for the Police to start pulling people over, The government to make proper punishments (Salary based tickets.), and the DOT to communicate proper driving tips.

We've been trying to get people to ""just drive better"" for 100 years. It doesn't work. It's a failed approach. The only things that work are infrastructure and technology. We make the cars safer for the people inside. And, on the other hand, we also have to create the infrastructure to prevent people from doing too much damage to the people outside. And, ultimately, like it or not, cars will get more and more tech in them that prevents what and where and how fast they can be driven at all. Letting people drive these things anywhere they want and at whatever speed they want was a fun 20th Century experiment, but it won't be like this forever.

My cheating ‚Äúquick‚Äù sick matzo ball soup is as follows:
You will need:

Lg can of low sodium chix broth 
Tin of osem consomm√©
Either the streits or manischewitz ball mix BUT follow mixing recipie below. 
Small package of boneless skinless thighs (4-6 pieces)
1 lb baby carrots
1 bunch celery
1-2 large yellow onions 


Start with lg soup pot
Add large can of chicken broth
Add equal amount of water, 
Add a tablespoon of consomm√© powder and set to boil


Mix ball mix with two eggs and 1/4 veg oil per packet (if you use less oil you will have hard sinkers instead of fluffy floaters. Mix throughly with a fork and let stand for 20 mins, at room temp

Dice chicken into bite size pieces and add to pot 
Add baby carrots to pot as is or cut in half (your choice)
Wash and dice celery into bite size pieces.
Slice onions in manner desired (your choice, ribbons small dice, whatever you like) 

After soup is at full boil and mix has stood for 20 mins (if you‚Äôve mis en place‚Äôd well only about 20-25 mins total prep time has elapsed)  being forming your balls. 

Coat your hands in cooking oil lightly or spray with Pam spray. Using the mixing fork scoop small amount into your hands and roll into golf ball sized balls LOOSELY DO NOT SQUEEZE. Drop into boiling soup immediately. 

Boil for 10 more mins, then drop to simmer. Simmer at least 30 mins. At this point the soup is done. Depending how soft you like the veg continue you to cook to your preference. Tase, adjust seasoning to taste. 

If you‚Äôre sick, throwing up, dehydrated, saltier is better as your electrolytes are off and that will help replenish them. 

Ladle up, and garnish with dried or fresh dill or pepper if you desire. Enjoy.

&gt; PROVIDENCE -- Governor Gina M. Raimondo on Monday declared a state of emergency in Rhode Island as the state tries to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus. Declaring a state of emergency gives us more tools in our toolbox, Raimondo said. Specifically, it will enable us to better tap into resources of the National Guard, if necessary, and it will make sure that we are first in line for any federal resources.A declaration that an emergency exists allows the state government to ease certain regulations so it can respond more quickly, such as buying supplies or hiring more workers to help local health officials. Last week, state health officials said they had decided against declaring a state of emergency because the state had not seen widespread community transmission of the virus. It is true, thankfully, we don't yet have and hopefully won't have broad community transition, Raimondo said Monday. 

&gt; But, she said, declaring an emergency would allow the state to quickly take steps such as activating the National Guard. She said the National Guard has not been activated yet, but they the Guard is already assisting and might be called upon to do more. Also, the state Department of Health director, Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, noted that, We have states around us who have community transmission. When asked it was a mixed message to declare an emergency while urging calm, Raimondo said, What I'm saying to the people of Rhode Island is: We need to take action. This is real. This is here. We expect more cases. But at the same time, she said, Statistically and factually, the risk to the average Rhode Islander at this point is low. So on an individual basis, Rhode Islanders need to take steps such as washing their hands and staying home if they're sick, Raimondo said. And as governor, she said, It's my job to make sure that we are protected for today, tomorrow, a week, and two weeks. So I'm putting everything in place to make sure we have as robust a response as possible so we are never caught flatfooted.

&gt; The state has set up two coronavirus testing sites in non-healthcare settings, using large tents, Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken said. The goal is to do the testing away from doctors' offices and hospitals so that more people don't get infected, he said.

&gt; Governor Raimondo said people would, in some cases, be able to drive through the testing sites. We are piloting them, Wendelken siad. They can have people drive through. But it can be challenging with the wind. At those locations, people will have their noses swabbed, and the samples will be sent to the State Health Laboratories for analysis, Wendelken said. State officials did not say where the testing sites are located and emphasized that they are not public facing. Members of the public should call their doctors first. Health care providers will then contact the Department of Health, and if people meet the criteria for testing, they will be directed to the test sites, officials said. There already is a team of five specialists from the federal Centers for Disease Control in the state, where four people have been infected and 290 people are now quarantined. There already is a team of five specialists from the federal Centers for Disease Control in the state, where four people have been infected and 290 people are now quarantined.Three students at Brown University are being tested for the virus, which causes a respiratory illness known as Covid-19, and are isolated pending the results of that test. Lifespan, the health agency that runs five hospitals in Rhode Island, stopped visits to patients last week.And state health officials continue to instruct nursing home operators to protect their elderly residents, who are at high risk for dying from the infection, by banning visitors who are younger than 18; traveled internationally in the previous 14 days; currently feel sick; or are having symptoms such as cough, fever, chills, runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat, or shortness of breath.They also have told the homes to screen everybody -- including employees, visitors, and vendors -- who enters their facilities for signs of illness or risk for Covid-19. The outbreak grew out of a trip to Europe, including Italy, by a group of students, staff, and teachers from Saint Raphael Academy, in Pawtucket, during February school vacation. Three people on that trip -- a male in his 40s, a teenage girl, and a woman who lives in Norfolk County in Massachusetts but works at Saint Rays -- fell ill and tested positive. The fourth person was not connected to the trip: She works at the Smithfield Avenue Nursery School in Pawtucket and apparently contracted the illness after she had direct contact in late February with a person in New York with a confirmed case, Rhode Island health officials said Friday night. The man who contracted the states first case of coronavirus remains hospitalized in stable condition, and he is continuing to improve, Alexander-Scott said. The other who tested positive remain at home with mild symptoms, health officials said.",1583797345,fk2bjcy

A lot of Rhode Islanders really don't understand why anyone would need to leave RI for anything. It's like they've set the boundaries of what is possible for them at the state line.

I've lost count of how many of my students have never been to Boston. It's near impossible to convince my graduating seniors to look for jobs outside of the state. When I suggest they should go see a sight that involves more than 30 minutes of driving, they start talking like it's an overnight trip. 

For example, I had a Dr. appointment in Boston a couple of years ago at 8:00. I finished the appointment, then drove to campus in time to teach at 10:00. My students were amazed that I had been to Boston *that morning*, and I was somehow already on campus to teach. I mean, *it's so far away*, how did I get back here in less than 90 minutes?

Here's something else I found too.

&gt;Q. How do I register a vehicle if it's a 2000 or older?  
&gt;  
&gt;A. Go to any DMV branch location and present your title and your  registration. If you do not have the title, the registration alone will  suffice. A copy of the previous owner's registration is acceptable. **If  you do not have proof of the previous owner's registration, proof can be  obtained at any DMV providing the last registered owner is the person's  name on your bill of sales.  The fee for this document is $11.50** along  with the bill of sale and personal identification such as a license or  Social Security card. Proof of residency should accompany these  documents.

7554,morbid_possum,"&gt;PROVIDENCE ‚Äî Rhode Island‚Äôs first confirmed coronavirus patient, the vice principal of student life at Saint Raphael Academy who led a field trip to Europe, spoke to The Wall Street Journal from the ICU at Miriam Hospital.

&gt;Marc Thibault, 48, who became one of the first patients diagnosed in the United States, said he used hand sanitizer frequently during the Feb. 14-22 trip, but in Italy, he shared a microphone with a tour guide who said he was coming down with the flu.

&gt;He felt sluggish on the flight home, he told The Wall Street Journal. He stayed home from work but went to a walk-in clinic when he felt worse, then a few days later to a hospital. Doctors at both places decided his symptoms did not qualify him for the coronavirus test, but the hospital contacted the R.I. Department of Health, which told him to get tested immediately.

&gt;He was tested at Miriam Hospital and admitted on Feb. 27.

&gt;Then, he said, the illness hit him ‚Äúlike a hurricane.‚Äù

&gt;He struggled to breathe. His lungs filled with fluid, and nurses in hazmat-style suits had to drain them every two hours.

&gt;The worst part, he said, was the feeling of choking. ‚ÄúYou feel like you‚Äôre asphyxiating, and you‚Äôre panicking because you can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù

&gt;He kept telling himself, ‚ÄúJust get through the next hour, the next hour, the next hour.‚Äù

&gt;At one point, he was aware that a priest in protective gear was about to administer last rites. He wrote a note to his wife saying that if his lungs collapsed, he did not want to be put on life support.

&gt;‚ÄúI was one inch from death,‚Äù he told the WSJ on Tuesday.

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alarming when I hear people minimize it as a simple cold,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt almost killed me.‚Äù",1583932734,fk7bfbp

Flu test was negative and I was put on an antibiotic. By Monday I was worse so I went back, got diagnosed with pneumonia, and put on a second antibiotic. Now it's Wednesday and I feel even worse. 

Urgent Care only asked me if I had been in contact with anyone who had tested positive or if I'd travelled internationally. I asked about any potential for having it and was told if I didn't fit those two categories the likelihood is very low. Yet there's community spread all across the country.

I was told I'd feel much better by Monday and to return to work, even if I was coughing/didn't feel 100%. Yet we're being told by the governor, board of health, the president, etc. to stay home when we're sick. lol I haven't been back to work yet. I still have a fever and I have coworkers whose spouses will absolutely die if they get Covid-19. I just want to know if I have it so I can plan accordingly. 

I'm calling my primary care doctor tomorrow. From my understanding you call your doctor, they call the board of health, and they're the ones making the decisions as to who's being tested.

Key phrase right here. Michael Osterholm, an expert on infectious diseases, mentioned on Joe Rogan's podcast that Italy is seeing an alarming number of severe cases in the 40-something age range. He mentions later that the virus can be much harder on individuals who are overweight or have high blood pressure, conditions much more common in the west than in China. The portrayal of this as being something that affects mostly older people doesn't seem to be entirely accurate.

Providence is a unique city where there is something for everyone (PVDfest is the coolest festival I have ever seen in a city).

7837,MadLove1348,"Honestly, there are pretty consistent symptoms and ways to tell if someone is highly likely or highly unlikely to have contracted the virus. You are most likely in the highly unlikely category. The problem with a pandemic is mass hysteria. Everyone now thinks they have Covid-19. There is no ‚Äúlack of tests‚Äù at this time and they are not ‚Äúholding out on you‚Äù by any means, you just simply do not have the symptoms concurrent with the virus. The good thing about this virus (if there is one) is that all cases present pretty much identical just on a range of severity in symptoms. If they gave everyone that wanted the test to be performed there would be a problem, because we likely would run out. Then people that do have the symptoms, would put the rest of the community at high risk. I cannot urge people enough to trust the nurses and doctors. If they don‚Äôt think you need the test, you don‚Äôt. Please don‚Äôt let your fear exponentially increase this pandemic. 

I recently got over the mumps. I was able to teleconference my doctor when the symptoms came on and he indeed told me I had the mumps. He encouraged me to not go into the office to help prevent the spread of the mumps to the rest of the RI community. All the office could do was test me for the mumps (which I clearly had) then give the newspapers something to write about, the community something to fear. I stayed home for 10 days and not a single person in RI was diagnosed with the mumps. He wrote to the CDC informing them he had a case of the mumps unofficial diagnosed but I self quarantined. (Note: If you were born before 1994 and received your MMR vaccines, you are at risk to contracting the mumps. Doctors recommend getting a second dosage around age 30 as the mumps portion of the vaccine dies off. I am 29, so didn‚Äôt get a new round of shots yet).",1584082530,fkdkmit

That‚Äôs like saying we shouldn‚Äôt care if the court is biased in the trial of a guy who stole $100,000, but we should care for a guy like Bernie Madoff who stole $100+ million dollars. But why should we *ever* accept a biased court?

You like to make grandiose pronouncements and then when people call you on them, you either say ‚ÄúWhere did I say that?‚Äù or you look for some unrelated element and try to divert the discussion toward it and away from your baseless assertions.

The simple fact is that state courts can and should adjudicate state laws. The only reason the oil companies in this case are trying to make it into a federal case is because they think federal judges are biased in *their* favor. It‚Äôs not a question of biased vs. unbiased, but whose bias should take precedence.

In some cases, there are reasons to avoid local bias, such as in southern courts during the civil rights era. But in other cases, the federal bias can run roughshod over local sovereignty, such as when coastal states wish to implement higher pollution standards than interior states or the federal government.

To simply assert that prominent state issues should be adjudicated in federal courts because state courts are inherently biased is itself biased nonsense, motivated by a conservative ideology that rejects holding large corporations responsible for the damage they‚Äôve done and continue to do.",1584126944,fkf4lor

Who it effects is not the sole basis for deciding whether it‚Äôs adjudicated at the state or federal level ‚Äî by that standard, practically everything would end up in federal court. The tobacco litigation involved suits by individual states to recover healthcare costs that were eventually combined into a single settlement agreement, similar to the way individual suits are combined into a class action.

Like I said, *your* bias is clear ‚Ä¶

&gt;this one will end up in federal court where it belongs.

At least one federal appeals court said the issue belonged in state court, because it doesn‚Äôt meet the legal test for being treated as a federal case. So you‚Äôre talking out of your ass, as usual.

And even if at some point it does get combined into a group settlement like tobacco, it won‚Äôt be about whether it‚Äôs an issue of state or federal law, who it effects, or because state courts are ‚Äúinherently biased‚Äù ‚Äî but simply about saving time and money.

And just like in a class action, individual states may choose to opt out of the multi-state settlement and continue to pursue a case on their own. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll automatically win, but it also means the case isn‚Äôt *ipso facto* a federal case ‚Ä¶",1584132204,fkfdsv1

7972,Caladfwlch,"&gt;Until last week, the Italian public health care system had the capacity to care for everyone. Our country has universal health care, so patients aren‚Äôt turned away from hospitals here. But in a matter of days, the system was being felled by a virus that I, and many other Italians, had failed to take seriously.

&gt;The inability of the medical system to deal with the flow of patients in critical condition is not one of the problems of this complex medical emergency. It is the problem. I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised. As a journalist, I had read, heard, and spoken to several experts explaining that the most immediate threat of Covid-19 was the hospital system becoming overwhelmed, and therefore the most pressing need was to avoid too many people getting sick at the same time, as resources are limited. (It‚Äôs what‚Äôs called ‚Äúflattening the curve.‚Äù)

&gt;But that information was somehow stored in some remote interstice of my mind, covered by an incessant flow of bits and charts on the mortality rate of the elderly, political mismanagement, quarrels over under-testing and over-testing, market collapses, projections on the economic impact of the epidemic, and so on. All of this is, of course, extremely relevant ‚Äî but at the same time feels totally irrelevant when lives are being lost in a situation that was preventable. As of Friday night, 1,266 people have died in Italy due to the outbreak.

&gt;So here‚Äôs my warning for the United States: It didn‚Äôt have to come to this.

&gt;We of course couldn‚Äôt stop the emergence of a previously unknown and deadly virus. But we could have mitigated the situation we are now in, in which people who could have been saved are dying. I, and too many others, could have taken a simple yet morally loaded action: We could have stayed home.

&gt;What has happened in Italy shows that less-than-urgent appeals to the public by the government to slightly change habits regarding social interactions aren‚Äôt enough when the terrible outcomes they are designed to prevent are not yet apparent; when they become evident, it‚Äôs generally too late to act. I and many other Italians just didn‚Äôt see the need to change our routines for a threat we could not see.

&gt;Italy has now been in lockdown since March 9; it took weeks after the virus first appeared here to realize that severe measures were absolutely necessary.

&gt;According to several data scientists, Italy is about 10 days ahead of Spain, Germany, and France in the epidemic progression, and 13 to 16 days ahead of the United Kingdom and the United States. That means those countries have the opportunity to take measures that today may look excessive and disproportionate, yet from the future, where I am now, are perfectly rational in order to avoid a health care system collapse. The United States has some 45,000 ICU beds, and even in a moderate outbreak scenario, some 200,000 Americans will need intensive care.",1584136159,fkfk38h

So stock up once, and then you don't have to go every week or coille of weeks or whatever.

Yes, but hopefully that is not a careless attitude. Again for most, this will be okay. The precautions are not just to protect yourself but also as to not unconsciously or ignorantly spread the virus. The people you come in contact with, you‚Äôre directly impacting. 

I am not scared at all, for MYSELF - but my 8 yr old son on the other hand has a very compromised immune system, along with him being nonverbal and the lack of being able to tell/show is where his distress may be coming from, makes this extremely scary as he can not tell us he can‚Äôt breathe, or is having trouble breathing. He wouldn‚Äôt even know to point to his lungs or chest. 

It‚Äôs everyone else not taking care of themselves and being careless that we are afraid of - again what YOU do, directly impacts everyone around you. 

So if you‚Äôre sitting here thinking it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù - you‚Äôre probably right.... it‚Äôs not for YOU, but it is a really big deal for someone else. So be mindful of your actions and practicing good hygiene over these next couple of months.",1584204683,fkhrmha

If you like a more upscale brewery scene Bayberry Beer Hall is a good spot. Julians or Rogue Island for casual but incredible brunch, again, if you want to go a little more upscale Nicks on Broadway and Nicks on Westminster are great options. Federal Hill has some of the best Italian spots around ranging from super casual to high end. Xaco Taco is kind of a hipster Mexican spot, Tortilla Flats is a casual joint, while California Taco (located around Warwick, Cranston and maybe Providence) has the best tacos but no booze. Los Andes is in my opinion the best restaurant in RI - it is Peruvian food, it‚Äôs in a shady area so don‚Äôt expect to walk around there, but do not miss it! Spain in Cranston is also really good, but Los Andes I think is better. You can always walk around Thayer St and stop in for a quick bite at East Side Pockets or anything in that area.

If you want to ‚Äúgo out‚Äù one night in Newport it will be a ~$40 Uber each way depending on where in Warwick your staying. Unless your not drinking, Ubering is mandatory. In terms of where to eat in Newport it‚Äôs either Perro Salado (upscale Mexican with the best margaritas), Diego‚Äôs (casual Mexican with the best margaritas), Pour Judgement (pub with incredible food), or choose from the upscale (and sometimes stuffy) seafood restaurants like the mooring, Clark‚Äôs cookhouse or midtown oyster bar.",1584282138,fkkemo8

&amp;#x200B;

Found it heartening that we have 200 extra ventilators ready to deploy (apparently some have already been staged). But, we need more, many more, very likely. 

And I wish we had closed all restaurants and bars except for take out and delivery. It's obviously just a matter of time until this is mandated, I just don't know how waiting helps. 

Quarantine centers and fever clinics were not addressed. China did this, and we're going to have to as well, but I don't hear the planning yet. For people who have fever, or otherwise think they should be tested, we need separate facilities for them to goto. The drive-thru testing being done is fine, but we need a place for people to wait that's isolated as well. This self-quarantine stuff is such lazy garbage. It's better than nothing, but we need to take the bitter pill already and appreciate hanging out with your family will infect your family. And is your family quarantined as well with you? We all know some of these people, they are not quarantined. They are exposed to people as close as they can be, then going out into the community--completely unacceptable. We need to set up quarantine centers for those who are pending tests, have tested positive but don't need hospitalization, those merely possibly exposed, and those discharged from the hospital but not yet 100% done shedding virus. 

We can do this, but first we have to face what we're up against.",1584300520,fkl81rd

I‚Äôm just laughing at you because you think that at this very moment, we could possibly set up create everything you‚Äôve listed as something *that has to happen* like your a feudal lord with a royal decree. 

UBI, expansion of unemployment, creation of food distribution centers, creation of services for food pick up and laundry and every other errand someone has to make? Creation of daycare for first responders, medical and essential personnel? 

How would you propose the state would even be able to facilitate ANY of this in a timely fashion that would even effect this disease? The states already covering all medical testing for this. The state has already waived TDI and unemployment waiting periods, they‚Äôve tripled DOH staffing for phone banks to drastically cut time waiting on the phone. They‚Äôve already cancelled countless events and are limiting places to small numbers. 

The city of Providence has already pulled licenses for bars and restaurants and bars, they‚Äôve already entered a Phase Two state of emergency which details who is expected to show up to work and who can work from home, they‚Äôve already stated anyone under quarantine will be paid for two weeks while they stay at home. Daycares and schools are closed to help stop the spread and they‚Äôve already started closing all public buildings to stop the spread there. 

Like what else do you want? There‚Äôs only so much the *state* can do. The rest falls on you and us. It‚Äôs our job to shut the fuck up and stay home, it‚Äôs on us to not be a dick and go out and cough on everyone. 

Hell, look at Cranston. They closed schools and told everyone to stay home. And what do the dumbasses from CHSW do? They go to the mall and hang out, thus negating any reason for the closure of the schools. 

The people fucking this up isn‚Äôt the state, it‚Äôs everyone who lives in the state being greedy and selfish.

I was addressing preparation and how under-prepared we are. Hence it's nice we have extra ventilators since so many severe cases of COVID require them, and we're likely to see a surge in severe cases.

Glad you gave a nice run down of what masks and respirators are and their limitations. I agree with most of what you say, except when you say they won't do any good. Again, don't listen to me, if you care to, read what the papers coming out of China and Hong Kong about mitigation strategy, where mask wearing by the general public is second only to social distancing in general for slowing down the spread. It's also just common sense that any barrier you place between your own sneeze or cough keeps others safer, as well as makes less likely you'll inhale droplets or more practically prevent you from touching your nose or mouth. Unless you use a mask with an attached shield your eyes will still be an issue, of course.  The issues isn't that masks don't help, it's that we do not have enough of them, and so they need to be conserved for healthcare professionals. If we ever get to a stage where we have an adequate supply, you'll see all the same authorities who have been telling us they're not perfect recommending the general public use them as much as possible.

Once they get supplies in order, there has to be a way to stagger things to get some immunity going in the low risk groups.

I don't know, but something has to be planned to do this gracefully. Let the kids go to bars but dip their hands in a 30 day stain and force them to self quarantine.

&gt;Most medical experts say that no one will be able to assess the strength and duration of the human immune response to Covid-19 until people who have recovered have been studied for months.
&gt;
Paul Hunter, a communicable diseases specialist at the University of East Anglia, said: ‚ÄúI will go out on a limb and suggest that the immunity will not last for a lifetime but will last for more than a few months ‚Äî possibly two or three years.‚Äù
&gt;
However, illustrating the range of medical opinion, Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, was more optimistic.
&gt;
‚ÄúThe evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with [Covid-19] leads to an antibody response that is protective,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost likely this protection is for life, although we need more evidence to be sure of this. People who have recovered are unlikely to be infected again.‚Äù",1584474946,fkrs5g0

We have been. My SO and I have been in self quarantine for the past week. She is immunocompromised so she can't protect herself if she does get COVID-19. I have to protect myself so I don't transmit it to her. 

But guess what... We still have to go out for groceries. We still have to travel outside of these 4 walls every once and awhile. If it wasn't for these restrictions I would still be required to go to work, interact with 100s of people a day and GREATLY increasing my risk and thus transmitting it to her. 

Reducing the risk of someone like us coming into contact with someone who has COVID-19 is the highest priority for the state at the moment. Reducing that likelihood is the purpose of all of these measures.

There are reports now that a huge percentage of people who have/had it didn't even realize it because the symptoms are so mild.

So many people really are just sheep. They see others getting panicked so they go along too. The hive mind, the mob mentality, it's real and you can see it in the eye's of the people you talk to driven to hysteria.

And here is a link of others talking about herd immunity. 
https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comments-about-herd-immunity/

And here is a  study that shows a flatter spike/curve once you end suppression if you don't close schools
https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/new-model-examines-impact-of-different-methods-of-coronavirus-control/?comments=1
&gt;The problem here is that the virus will remain circulating at low levels in the population in this scenario. The authors model releasing the restrictions in September, and by October, a peak appears that rivals the one caused by doing nothing to begin with. (Although less effective forms of suppression have a lower peak because so many people ended up infected in the intervening months.) 

Here is the chart from that study that says 10-19 have a .006% mortality and 20-29 .03%

I would say it's possible shelter in place will happen at some point in the future. But it's not that stark, it's not in the immediate future, and ideally it will be done as a preventative measure, \*before\* hospitals are overwhelmed.

As I understand it, this is going to be a long, difficult ordeal with covid. There will be a ""new normal"" which might be similar to the current state. The disease will ebb and flow through the population. As the cases start to pile up in an area, severe lockdowns/shelter-in-place might need to be enacted. When the cases drop, the restrictions will be loosened. This is one possible scenario. 

Again, definitely not in the near future (2 weeks), but some point in the future? Maybe. If you look at south korea, they haven't had to lockdown, because they were quick to take preventative measures, track cases, etc. I think vietnam has also been successful, but I'm not sure.",1584583568,fkw4yog

&gt;People who think they have COVID-19 should call their healthcare provider. These people should NOT go directly to a healthcare facility without calling a healthcare provider (unless they are experiencing a medical emergency). 

My advice: If they don't have insurance, then call healthsource RI 1-855-840-4774  or go to their website (I'd suggest calling, even though I hate talking on the phone). Get health insurance. 

Then, call urgent care. They'll have a better idea of how serious the symptoms are with the respiratory illness, age, medical history, etc. They might just tell them to stay home and monitor symptoms.

If the person can't get insurance for whatever reason, I'd still call the urgent care. Society is about to go through a restructuring of *some kind*. Medical debt probably won't be that big of deal in 6 months or so.",1584587262,fkwae5p

It's literally to point out ""it's not her job to do so"".

If you don't agree with that then that is fine, everyone has a different opinion. However you're reading more into that comment than it was meant.

You were commenting on why she wasn't addressing the mental aspect of it.. I responded she's not a therapist.. Meaning that's not her job.

Maybe it didn't come across right on your end and I'll apologize for that.. But it hasn't been my intent to be obtuse or anything of the sort? That's why I asked why the wow and tried to point out I was just answering it matter of factly.

They do not enforce water quality issues, thats division of water resource and compliance and inspection. RI does not issue criminal penalties for environmental issues, only administrative fines. How do I know? I  WORK THERE AND HANDLE THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR WATER QUALITY. 

Yes, they patrol areas for illegal hunting, fishing and potential rabid animals. However, like I said, EPOs make up 5% of DEM. The vast majority are desk jobs.

Gloves provide a clean surface when they‚Äôre changed, assuming they‚Äôre sterile. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs morons like you who think you can slap on a pair of gloves and forget basic hygiene that cause issues. I‚Äôd say educate yourself, but you can‚Äôt fix stupid.",1584741363,fl22bwm

On the first page it will tell you when you need to login to collect first payment, you have to go to the teleserve website and create a pin, but don't try to claim yet as it will just tell you to call in as you do not have a payment to collect until they say it starts. 

I was quite confused by the whole process and was not in the best place while trying to figure it all out. I filed on Monday and didn't get anything until yesterday evening at like midnight so it is taking them a couple days longer for sure.

Essentially they are reaching out to your former employer, asking what your weekly rate was, and if you got severance in order to setup your payments. So if you are seeing a long turn around they may be having trouble reaching your employer,  or may be waiting for the severance info to calculate payments.

Worst case you can call them, they are very friendly and understand this is a really shitty time for the people making claims so just be polite and let them know you have been waiting for +48 hours and just want to make sure there isn't something else they need from you.

Also in the meantime go to EmployRI.com and make a resume and account so you can stay in the guidelines. I do believe for Co-vid 19 claims this has been waived but never hurts to have a post out there to snag something especially since most companies doing layoffs may cease to exist, or will at least not be able to rehire until things settle down.",1584749223,fl2eksv

At around this time I learned I would be needing to move to mass soon. I remember looking up the forums and seeing that some towns are stricter than others, namely Cambridge. I also remember reading how bitchy mass was on the subject so I held off buying one. 

So I am still an RI resident and am moving this week and next week. I guess I am wondering what my best bet is. Am I better off buying one now while still an RI resident ? (TBH idk if I will even transfer residence right away).

I remember finding a great starter pistol after I took the lesson and then finding out I can't have it in Cambridge and some other cities, made me hate the state even more. So I held off buying until I knew exactly what down I was going to move to for work, which apparently is quincy.

I'm thinking a scenario like some poor guy sitting in an office that just got like 10 stacks of papers dropped in front of him with his boss going these need to be done in 4 hours. Obviously not exact representation here but I'm feeling this is the most likely reason.

Extending it gives those workers the time they need to accurately process the huge influx of work.

And I've no doubt they must be getting more than they're used to the gun shop down the road from my aunt has been packed all week. She messaged me on friday saying the line was out the door.

I get the fear of 'what if they try to keep this rule after the pandemic is over' but I genuinely think the police asked for this not to bar people from access to guns but just to allow them time to keep up with the work flow.


As a side note, not that I have anything against gun ownership, but I'm honestly saddened seeing so many peoples reaction to go out and buy a gun rather than go around making sure their family/friends/neighbors have essential supplies.

Like if I bought 3 cases of toilet paper and the guy in the apt next to me couldn't find any I'd give him a case... Not be like gotta go get a gun so I can shoot anyone that tries to take a case.

Retailers take credit card payments with no fees because it encourages consumers too spend more. It‚Äôs a *little* different with rent. 

You can pay your rent from your checking account at no cost is because an ACH draft costs less than a buck.  Credit cards charge a percentage of the total transaction, so unless your rent is about $50 / month the fees for both are not in the same ballpark - or even area code. 

This will absolutely cost them money - on fees.  What you and everyone else is missing is that, as with most business decisions, this is a calculated risk. They‚Äôre clearly concerned that many of their customers will lose their income stream and be unable to afford rent. That‚Äôs tremendously costly to them as evictions take time (where they‚Äôre not getting paid) and cost money.  Their hope is that by reducing the costs visible to consumers associated with credit card payments, people will be more willing to possibly financially over-extend themselves to pay their rent.

Mass has some strict laws, in fact if you have ever gotten a dui or an oui mass has the law written so that you will be a prohibited possessor in any state. For firearms purposes any crime with a sentence of more than a year is considered a felony, even if the state calls it a misdemeanor. Mass oui sentence is 1 year and 1 day. Could this be what got you?

Just to be clear, you're saying you failed the federal check? Are you sure you failed or did you get a hold?

It's also possible the feds fucked up in some way. If the other things I've mentioned aren't it, this is the most plausible. I've seen it before, but not to me but a friend with a name similar to a fugitive. I've also heard plenty of times they've messed up and when you appeal they fix it.

There are a few not well known provisions to RI law which prohibit possession. Probably a good idea to take a look and see if it applies to you.

Since you‚Äôve already been to the hospital and have no fever, they figure you‚Äôre not emergent. Otherwise, it makes no sense. Hope you feel better soon.

I am not a healthcare worker, but my wife is. She hasn't had any symptoms...yet. For all I know, I may have gotten it from her, with her picking it up from any of the dozens of people she sees in any given workday.

Yes, DOH really needs to get their message straight. Don't tell us to call DOH, or have the medical providers (docs and hospitals) telling their patients to call DOH, if the response I got is what we're all going to get. It's a waste of everyone's time.",1584822042,fl4uwbg

Aren't the odds greater that someone who is already that sick isn't likely to be helped out as much as someone who has less severe symptoms at this point because the virus is early in it's gestation in that person? Tough call, but there will be plenty more tough calls to come, if what's going on in Italy is any indication.

The story, from ProJo:

&gt;PROVIDENCE State government in Rhode Island is ‚Äúweeks not months‚Äù away from running out of money to pay its bills and payroll amid the Covid-19 public health emergency, according to state General Treasurer Seth Magaziner.

&gt;‚ÄùI am completely committed,‚Ä≥ Magaziner said in an end of week interview, ‚Äúto making sure that that does not happen and that state agencies have the funding that they need to do their work servicing people in this very important time.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄùThat being said, we are clearly in a very serious situation financially‚Äù both short-term and potentially long-term, he said.

&gt;**‚ÄùThe short-term problem is that, in the absence of action, the general fund could run out of cash within a matter of weeks... . [But] we are acting to make sure that that does not happen.‚Äù**

&gt;Democrat Magaziner said he is not ready to lay out a plan, but it will likely rely on infusion of cash from three directions:

&gt;The federal government to shore up the unemployment benefits fund, and ‚Äúhelp pay for the emergency spending that the state and the hospitals are needing to take on in order to help people during this time.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄùTo be blunt about it, I don‚Äô think that any state is going to be able to get through this crisis completely without federal assistance. That is absolutely vital,‚Ä≥ Magaziner said.

&gt;Temporary ‚Äúloans‚Äù from other state accounts, including potentially the state‚Äôs $203.8 million ‚Äúrainy-day‚Äù account and $14.8 million highway trust fund. (The only no-no: delaying payments to the state pension fund.)

Hang on a sec, there‚Äôs a $14.8 million highway trust fund? What‚Äôs the money really being spent on? Def not pot holes. Anyway, 

&gt;Borrowing in both traditional and non-traditional ways (such as lines of credit from private lenders) in anticipation of delayed tax payments such as the income tax, now not due until July 15.

&gt;He said the state‚Äô separate unemployment and temporary disability funds ‚Äúhave enough funding to make it through the next couple of months.

&gt;‚ÄùBut the claims volume that we are seeing of people signing up for unemployment, signing up for TDI either because they are sick or they are home to care for a loved one is truly unprecedented and within a matter of months, that could put strain on those programs in the absence of corrective action.‚Äù

&gt;With 5,222 more applications for unemployment benefits on Friday, the number of claims since March 9 has now reached 37,075, according to the Department of Labor &amp; Training. The number of TDI claims during that same period: 6,270.

&gt;‚ÄùThe claims that have come in just in the last few days are coming in much more rapidly than they did even during the Great Recession,‚Ä≥ Magaziner said.

&gt;Beyond that, he said: there is the state budget, which was already facing a deficit estimated at $200 million ‚Äúbefore this crisis began.‚Äù

&gt;(Even before the Covid-19 pandemic froze many segments of the Rhode Island economy including the casinos state lawmakers had effectively rejected many of Governor Raimondo‚Äôs proposals for plugging the hole.)

&gt;**Magaziner said he does not know the date the state hypothetically runs out of money because ‚Äúthings are changing very rapidly,.‚Äù**

No shit. So don‚Äôt cause panic. 

&gt;For example, he said, the state is still awaiting word on how much money it might receive from the federal bailout package still taking shape in Washington.

&gt;He said Rhode Island is hopeful of getting a temporary, multi million increase in federal Medicaid dollars, based on information provided to the state‚Äôs Executive Office of Health &amp; Human Services about the likely availability of extra money to states grappling with COVID-19 costs.

&gt;EOHHS spokesman David Levesque elaborated: ‚ÄúA bill passed on Wednesday night that will provide a 6.2% increase to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages... We‚Äôre estimating the increase will result in an additionally $25 million per quarter....while the nation faces this public health emergency.

&gt;‚ÄùThe state is still working through how the additional funds could best be used,‚Ä≥ he said.

&gt;Asked about the potential for a tax increase as well,Magaziner said:

&gt;‚ÄùIn the absence of federal support,‚Ä¥ Magaziner said, the payroll taxes that finance the unemployment fund would go up automatically.

&gt;**‚ÄùWe are still working through what the full range of options are, not only which one can be helpful financially but also what the legal steps would be ... because some of these things potentially could be done administratively. ... Others would require legislative action.‚Äù**

&gt;Magaziner said he hopes to have more specifics within days.

Right, but with a poll tax, there are certainly people who can't pay. In the gun scenario, your right isn't being taken away. And, again, the case you brought up was dealing with an injunction. That's a very different scenario. I'd have to read the case to see how long the injunction was, but dealing with an injunction is dealing with a waiting period for a gun. 

Guns are always a troublesome issue for me. While I accept that it's a constitutional right, I'm also of the mindset that while everyone is legally entitled to own a gun, I don't believe that every person is suited for gun ownership and I don't know how to address that issue. I would draw an analogy to being a lawyer or a doctor. While any person could be one, not everyone person should be one. While I fully acknowledge that this isn't a direct comparison because there is no constitution right at play, I think you can see where I'm going. There are just certain people, no matter how much training, will never be suited to be a lawyer or a doctor. I think the same thing is true for gun ownership, although there is a right for them, not every person is suited to own one.",1584842481,fl5pl6z

I called the urgent care clinic down the street from me (Carewell Urgent Care on Centerville Rd in Warwick) saying I‚Äôve been experiencing symptoms and I needed a test for coronavirus. I was basically immediately dismissed from the phone call, with the woman saying that they don‚Äôt do testing there and I‚Äôd need to coordinate with the Department of Health. I call RIDOH, am stuck on hold for 30 minutes, finally get a person. They ask if I called urgent care. I say I did, and the DoH guy says that RI policy is that a doctor must contact the DoH for you.

I call urgent care again, and they are bewildered by what the DoH guy said. Went on hold again, when they came back they said that they can now do the testing, but that it will be $200, plus an urgent care copay, plus additional fees up front for the test and lab work. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield, and they said in public that all fees associated with Covid testing have been waived.

Urgent care says otherwise.

So I call BCBS, and the guy on the phone confirms to me that all fees of any sort have been waived for Covid testing and treatment, plus any facility copays are waived too. I get confirmation info from the guy, and the moment I‚Äôm off the phone with him, urgent care calls again. Now they‚Äôre saying that because I‚Äôm the first person to request a Covid test from them, I‚Äôd have to get an order for a test from the Department of Health and it wouldn‚Äôt be for that day. I immediately give them the BCBS contact info, and the phone lady says that she needs to contact both them and the clinic‚Äôs billing department.

Ten minutes later, I get another call back, and the clinic agrees to test me onsite for Covid with all fees waived. It has to be in the parking lot though with me sitting in my car. I drive there, call them from the parking lot, they hang up. Ten minutes later, they call back, take my info, hang up again. Fifteen minutes later, doctor comes out in full hazmat gear. They do the tests (throat swab for strep, one set of nose swabs for influenza, one more set of nose swabs for Covid). He goes back inside. 30 minutes later, I get a call from the desk lady saying that I tested negative for influenza and strep, so they‚Äôre going to send the Covid samples off to the lab for testing. I get my discharge paper five minutes later, and I‚Äôm free.

10283,CellarDarling,"It's hypothesized that one can estimated actual COVID 19 cases in an area based on deaths. As Rhode Island hasn't reported any (yet), this isn't necessarily possible yet.

Here's a how-to from Khan Academy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk)  


As soon as one death occurs, using the assumptions below, that means the actual number of infected people in Rhode Island would be approx 1,600 cases. If we are to use the U.S. average of 2.5 days to double, then we have 25,600 cases.

***Assumptions:*** 

**Assuming a mortality rate of:** 1%

**Time to double:** Using a *conservative* 5 days (U.S. average is 2.5 at the moment)

This is based on the work of Tomas Pueyo: [https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca)

**In short:** If we start seeing deaths in Rhode Island, it may be very, very good idea to implement an *enforced* shutdown to flatten the curve *immediately.*",1584854388,fl64qc5
10284,CellarDarling,"It would be. I'd rather get the shutdown over and done with while this is manageable. The only issue is our inter-dependence on other states, so...we would have to sync our shutdowns with CT and MA, and have them ideally agree on a date.

Also, half-measures like Italy didn't work. The Chinese Red Cross warned Italy that there were too many people out and about. Perhaps we could implement a system like that of Wuhan, where a member of each household was allowed to leave once a week to do errands.",1584855443,fl65up7

I‚Äôd also encourage you to look into what they did there. I wish I had the link, but I just watched videos of police officers and army personnel barricading people inside, welding doors shut, and beating people.

10288,CellarDarling,"https://fair.org/home/coronavirus-alarm-blends-yellow-peril-and-red-scare/

Take a look at Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting's analysis on Western media's problematic reporting of what China did. China didn't arrest a doctor for ""whistle-blowing.""

&gt; In fact, the Times‚Äô own ‚Äúreconstruction of the crucial seven weeks between the appearance of the first symptoms in early December and the government‚Äôs decision to lock down the city‚Äù (2/1/20) disproves the corporate media narrative of authoritarian secrecy to maintain ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù over unrest. Li wasn‚Äôt a virologist or epidemiologist treating affected patients; he was an ophthalmologist who treated eye problems, which might be why he incorrectly claimed that the new virus was SARS, a related but different coronavirus.

Also, I can put to other examples other than China. Taiwan is doing an amazing job of containment. So is Singapore. Although, they were more proactive. A model that is perhaps closer to where are right now would be South Korea's, where we could adopt their methods and be able to successfully flatten the curve.",1584856867,fl67alb

- Taiwan handled the virus in an infinitely more humane way than China did. Their responses aren‚Äôt even close. There are no similarities between the two, at all. I would love if America handled this like Taiwan.

- you ignored the fact that there are literally videos of police/army personnel barricading people into their homes and welding doors shut. There are people who starved to death.

I  was hopeful until I browsed social media. People are having parties and  hanging around together in Parks. I saw photos of people congregating  in supermarkets. Grocery stores are going to be a breeding ground for  the virus. More needs to be done to protect workers and customers. A  small percentage of the population still believes this virus is the same  as the common flu. The Government will have no choice but to take a  tougher stance because of a selective few.

&gt;*""A small percentage of the population still believes this virus is the same as the common flu.""*

Everyones  opinion on this is different . .  but the  media/tabloid press is  finally mentioning (very quietly) that America's death total for *this*  seasons FLU is over 20,000 . .compared to this seasons Corona-19 @ just  over 2,000 . . even while being HUGELY more contagious .  .if all of  the same precautions were in place before  this new panic there'd be no  problem now . .

The only people who can violate HIPAA are medical staff or people involved in your medical care.

We have a virus here, that yes is extremely contagious, but who‚Äôs victim profile, is almost exclusively elderly people over 75 years old WITH pre-existing medical issues. So while it is an awful thing that people who have lived long lives are being struck down at 75 instead of 85, (average age of death in US is 78), I do not believe our government, federal and states, response should be to devastate the economy. 

All these orders are doing a lot more than causing boredom to people, especially those under 50 with no medical issues, who have almost no chance of dying and very low chance of even being admitted to an ICU. What these government decisions are doing is setting us up to take on MAJOR debt, killing our valuable small businesses like storefronts and restaurants, and putting thousands of Rhode Islanders out of work... a $1200 check isn‚Äôt going to cover rent for a large population of this state who can‚Äôt even afford a $500 emergency expense. 

We should be strongly reminded and encouraged to practice proper sanitation every and focus on keeping our dwellings, the only places that we have control, free from the virus. 

But Americans as a whole should be allowed to work, maybe just institute crowd limitations.

As for the elderly folk in RI, the people that ARE at risk, it is awful, but many of us who hold jobs in this state do not live with elderly family members who we could infect. Why not focus state resources on keeping the most vulnerable indoors and socially isolated, since they‚Äôre the ones at risk? 

I am sure we as a community would be willing to pick up the medicine/food/entertainment for our elderly population in exchange for putting nursing homes, retirement homes, etc, on a strict lockdown. This would cause far less repercussions than just dropping a legislative bomb on our economy.

10527,PettiCasey,"&gt;Italy is reporting ‚Äúco-causes‚Äù of death. So if you have lung cancer, and got covid then died, they record that as covid death.

It's not a ""co-cause"".  These people would be alive if not for corona.  They died from Coronavirus.  Of course it's counted.  

The reason you're seeing high death rates out of Italy is because of the hospitalization rate.  Currently 12-14% of infected people require hospitalization.  If there isn't room for them in the hospital they are much more likely to die.  That's why you see lower death rates in countries with fewer cases.  Those countries can use more resources on individual patients. Resulting in a lower death rate. This is why everyone is trying to flatten the curve reducing the number of sick at any given time.  

&gt; It‚Äôs amazing that liberals have found so many ways to shame any optimism at all about this situation. 

Ignoring the politicization of this comment, I don't see much reason to be optimistic. The economy is going to be a huge problem going forward.  Many Americans lost significant amounts of money and retirement money.  This country is looking at historic unemployment and record bailouts.  Not only to ""too big to fail' companies but states and individuals as well. Nothing about the economy looks good.  It's a huge problem.  People need to recognize what's happening.",1584914920,fl8365g

10530,rfb4e,"This is about hospitalization rate as much as it is about fatality rate and age demos.  First off, not sure what level of ignorance I'm dealing with here so main thing of note: *this. Is. Not. The. Flu*

From a general ""why are we doing all this?"" perspective, you have to recognize that this is much worse than a particularly bad case of flu that kills a lot more old people than normal. This is a whole new disease we've never seen before. Do not expect it to track statistically with the flu in everything except fatality rate.  This spreads much more easily. It stays on surfaces for days in some cases. This can spread much faster. Flu also has the benefit of the most vulnerable in society having access to vaccines and years of studied medical treatments.  We have none of that yet.

Additionally, we aren't even scratching the surface here in regards to what happens when the healthcare system in a given location hits peak capacity.  *Hospitalization* rate is probably almost as important as fatality rate for this new disease.  Again here, this is nothing like the flu. While most young people get through this, there is still an abnormally high hospitalization rate for people under 50 who get the disease. Our hospitals are built to run at a comfortable bit below capacity during a normal peak flu season. They are not remotely equipped for what is coming.  Again, this disease is new. It's weird. There are younger people who are entirely asymptomatic and others who need to spend a week on a ventilator in the hospital.  We simply don't have a full understanding of how and why different people are impacted in different ways.  Obviously age is probably the *biggest* factor, but we need time and need to learn a lot more before the country as a whole can have a comfortable grasp on handling this thing. In the meantime, slowing the spread is the most important thing. The fatality rate now is a situation where only the people we simply cannot do anything to save with modern medicine will die. One we run out of beds, doctors, and ventilators, that rate will skyrocket as doctors have to start picking and choosing the people they're *most likely* to be able to save.  In Italy, this has translated to hospitals in the worst hit areas sending patients over the age of 60 home to either fight it off on their own or die.

That is the ugly reality of what we're trying to stave off here.  We have a strong healthcare infrastructure but it is not equipped to handle this.  They need time to ramp up for what's coming. I get that people need to work, but putting people out in society at packed bars and restaurants now would be deeply irresponsible and quite frankly, an insult to the sacrifice that's about to be made by so many of our healthcare workers in the coming weeks.  Their plate is about to overflow and literally anything we as a society can do right now to make the wave of suffering they're about to experience a little bit more manageable simply needs to be done without an argument. Essentials of the supply chain must continue on and those should be the only people out in society right now. Those are the people most at risk right now. Those are the people likely to be infected earning 10 bucks an hour working as a cashier at the market or stocking shelves or trucking supplies across the country.  A good number of these people are going to be exposed and that's probably about all our healthcare industry can handle right now considering how fast this virus spreads.  

Long story short, just pretend we're running the country in Safe Mode right now.  It's temporary, we can't do everything we want to at the moment, but it's necessary in order for us to evaluate the situation responsibly and figure out what's going on.  We only get one shot at this, and with a virus that takes up to two weeks to incubate, if we find out two weeks from now we didn't do enough, the reality of the two weeks after that would likely be too dark to think about.  The only thing we *can* do with something like this is to overreact in the present and pray we overreacted enough for the future as well.",1584915172,fl83ljp

*With 83 cases now confirmed, governor closes recreation, entertainment, and personal care shops as of 5 p.m. Monday*

By Dan McGowan Globe Staff
Updated March 23, 2020, 3 hours ago

PROVIDENCE ‚Äì Governor Gina Raimondo announced Sunday that 17 more Rhode Island residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the state‚Äôs total to 83.

During her daily media briefing, Raimondo also said she is shutting down recreation and entertainment facilities, barbershops, hair and nail salons, and spas as of 5 p.m. Monday until further notice.

A clearly frustrated governor told residents ‚Äúto get more serious‚Äù about keeping at least 6 feet away from other people -- the ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù recommended by epidemiologists -- as the highly contagious disease continues to spread in the state.

She warned that if people don‚Äôt stop gathering in groups larger than 10 people, the state will be forced to move to a ‚Äústatewide lockdown.‚Äù Other governors have ordered residents to stay home except for essential errands and activities.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a joke,‚Äù Raimondo said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not a joke. People will die.‚Äù

Raimondo offered her strongest warning yet that residents should not be getting together in groups, echoing comments made about people in New York City earlier in the day by Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Get Rhode Map in your inboxThe path forward for Rhode Island's economy. The state of our schools. The future of downtown development. These are big issues that need vigorous debate and creative solutions. And the Globe will be there, keeping you informed and involved.

‚ÄúWhat we do in these next two weeks will determine our collective future,‚Äù Raimondo said.

The 17 new cases represent the biggest single-day jump since the state revealed the first two cases March 1, and was the fifth consecutive day that at least 10 additional residents tested positive for the disease. Raimondo has repeatedly warned that the state‚Äôs numbers will rise as more tests are conducted.

Worldwide, more than 328,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus; in the US, the number has surpassed 31,000, with close to 400 deaths.

Raimondo said she remains opposed to requiring residents to shelter in place the way California has done, but she made it clear she believes most adults should work from home this week. The state‚Äôs public schools will begin ‚Äúdistance learning‚Äù programming for at least two weeks on Monday.

In addition to the new closures, Raimondo announced that a unit of the Army Corps of Engineers will be deployed in Rhode Island to begin readying buildings in the event that hospitals see a surge in infected people. She said the state has been preparing its ‚Äúsurge capacity‚Äù for weeks.",1584975456,fla2xm1

On the other hand, the [U.S. National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/41/17290) offers this:

&gt;‚ÄùRecent events highlight the importance of examining the impact of economic downturns on population health. The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most important economic downturn in the U.S. in the twentieth century.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;We used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine associations of economic growth with population health for the period 1920‚Äì1940. We conducted descriptive analyses of trends and examined associations between annual changes in health indicators and annual changes in economic activity using correlations and regression models. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;**Population health did not decline and indeed generally improved during the 4 years of the Great Depression, 1930‚Äì1933, with mortality decreasing for almost all ages, and life expectancy increasing by several years in males, females, whites, and nonwhites**.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;*For most age groups, mortality tended to peak during years of strong economic expansion* (such as 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1936‚Äì1937). *In contrast, the recessions of 1921, 1930‚Äì1933, and 1938 coincided with declines in mortality and gains in life expectancy*. The only exception was suicide mortality which increased during the Great Depression, but accounted for less than 2% of deaths.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Correlation and regression analyses confirmed a significant negative effect of economic *expansions* on health gains. The evolution of population health during the years 1920‚Äì1940 confirms the counterintuitive hypothesis that, as in other historical periods and market economies, population health tends to evolve better during recessions than in expansions.‚Äù",1584981247,flacoe1

10743,WikiTextBot,"**Great Depression**

The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries, it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world's economy can decline.The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929, (known as Black Tuesday).

The waves that you speak of will require, at least, another 15 day duration of social distancing and, perhaps, total shutdown. The longer this is delayed the more likely the economy doesn‚Äôt recover anytime soon. Again, the priority is to prevent hospitals from overflow and once that hospitalization number tips into deaths (which will likely happen in a month or two), not the semblance of some economy that has long been fucked regardless.",1584986399,flalsy3

On top of this there has been efforts to expedite TDI and unemployment claims on top of efforts to expand other governmental benefits.

I believe the thinking is that between the current support systems in place and financial help that will be coming from the Federal Government (hopefully someday soon) in the form of a stimulus package should be enough to get the majority though these rough financial times. 

&gt;Specifically, we call for a suspension of all rent, utility and mortgage payments for at least three (3) full months to allow people to do what they need to in order to take care of themselves, their loved ones, and the community.

I think we are underestimating the massive impact it would have if of all of Rhode Island stopped paying their utilities, mortgage, and rent bills at once.

Across the street from us the developers put up a few rental properties, no big deal, it‚Äôs awesome they surrounded the rentals with home owners and the idea actually worked. Those renters for the most part became home owners because they saw the benefits of it.  One of the renters was from that same JW church but I thought no big deal they don‚Äôt spot in their own neighborhoods. I was wrong. Way wrong. Not only did they approach us monthly and sometimes bi-monthly but they decided to have the ‚Äúmen‚Äôs meetings and bible studies‚Äù at that apartment. So in retaliation I walked over to one of their BBQS at the meeting apartment wearing a red shirt with devil horns on it.

It kinda sucks, because im a bus driver, and no school means no check, and i haven't been driving on a CDL long enough to meet most places minimum reqs. 
Also, whole reason the job was good is because it allowed me to go home in the mid day to take care of my rescue dog. 

Im a bit scared to apply for UI, because the bus driving didnt pay my bills, it only worked out because i supplemented with lyft. So, UI being less than my wages would extra not pay my bills, and im not sure i would even be allowed to do lyft if i take UI, which i cant afford to do. 

Idk what to do exactly. Sitting on a little nest egg because i sold some stuff right before all this when i saw the writing on the walls. Cant really cancel services because all i have is my mortgage, my CC, car insurance and phone and electric/water as bills and none of them are cancelable.

11033,UseYourIllusion4,"I‚Äôm a real estate attorney and I was just taking to a client about this today. 

First off, I get that many people can‚Äôt afford to pay the rent. But when they voice these concerns the overwhelming majority of people respond with a ‚ÄúFuck the rich landlord‚Äù sentiment. 

The VAST majority of my clients who own rental properties are regular folks. For example: Navy families who bought a home then got relocated and decided to keep it as a rental. 

This idea that landlords are all rich and powerful is wrong and dangerous. Most are average joes. 

Second, the prohibition on evictions seems like a good idea but it is full of unintended consequences. So your existing tenants who are scheduled to be out 3/31 tell you they won‚Äôt leave because they have nowhere to go. Makes sense. But what about the tenant who was supposed to move in on 4/1? You can‚Äôt evict the old tenant so what happens to the new one. Do they become homeless?

I‚Äôm not promoting either side of the spectrum. But just trying to point out that the issue isn‚Äôt black and white. 

When talking to my client today I told him that we all just need to be human beings to each other. In my prior example that may mean the old tenant and the new tenant decide to share the property temporarily. Who knows.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;Each patient encounter requires a full gown, gloves, face shield, goggles, and a mask to keep viral particles from entering the lungs or skin. We have been promised huge deliveries of supplies by our federal government that are not showing up in our emergency departments. Instead, our supplies are dwindling, and we are being urged to re-use masks on the order of weeks if possible, which constitutes ‚Äúcrisis capacity‚Äù strategies per the CDC. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;The use of bandanas as a ‚Äúhomemade mask‚Äù alternative has even been proposed, which in no way provides safe protection from this illness. This is not the time to lower our standards and accept substandard protection advised by our government. Without adequate protection, health care workers will fall ill, which has already happened to colleagues across the country.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Equally frustrating, of the countless patients I saw on my recent shifts, I was able to order only a handful of tests due to severe restrictions put on testing. I spent infinitely more time explaining why no testing could be done, apologizing and shouldering the blame for what feels like a federal failure.‚Äù",1585062984,fldenqh

Here's the thing: Yes, social distancing, etc. has helped slow the virus. Yes, the governor has been trying to build out necessary infrastructure. nationally and internationally, treatments are being studied. However, there's no scenario where hospitals are built out enough to deal with the surge if the virus goes unchecked. In RI alone, if the virus went unchecked, you'd be looking at tens of thousands of people that need hospitalization.

Here's what I gather is happening in Chinese places returning to normalcy, and SK and japan: Everyone wears masks outside.  Anybody that is a little suspicious of being infected can get tested.  Social distancing is still in place. Temperatures are checked at large stores before lettin gpeople inside.  Public areas are sanitized regularly. People are isolated after regional travel.

11543,rfb4e,"&gt;Everyone wears masks outside. Anybody that is a little suspicious of being infected can get tested. Social distancing is still in place. Temperatures are checked at large stores before lettin gpeople inside. Public areas are sanitized regularly. People are isolated after regional travel. 

This is the reality that American politicians seem to be glossing over right now. The measures that have been taken in Asia to reopen their economies during the pandemic are much less of a stretch to achieve there than they are here.  Widespread mask use is already very common in many Asian countries - currently we don't even have close to enough masks for our own healthcare workers.  Testing and contact tracing is also very effective and borderline invasive in these countries right now.  Metadata is used broadly to track individual movement and trace contacts of infected people to blunt outbreaks before they happen. 

These things *can* be done here, but we are not remotely close to being ready to adopt these policies.  In most states, only the very I'll are even able to get a test. We have no *real* evidence of the actial infection growth in most states outside of extrapolation via deaths and hospitalizations. We need antibody tests to determine people who have already had it.  We need masks. Lots of masks. Masks work. We have been openly lied to about masks - probably for good reason though - our hospitals were severely deficient, and at the end of the day it's most important for healthcare workers to have them.  If we want people going about like normal in the middle of a pandemic, however, we all do need them.  We need temperature checks at every place of business. We need invasive, surveillance state level tracking of movement of individuals for contact tracing.  We need a social safety net so people who get sick don't go to work and spread it to other people.  

Most of these things are either very expensive or an imposition on US cultures and mindsets. We are a very individualist culture. We are not big on collectivist sacrifice.  A pandemic doesn't really care about any of that though. Those are the things that you have to do if you want to depress the R0 of a highly contagious disease below 1 while allowing people out of their houses.  These are hard, huge ass horse pills to swallow for the western world, but in countries in Asia where they've had success this is just a minor adjustment.",1585137940,flgbhxq

Pennsylvania is the only swing state with even 10% Italian American heritage. 
Further, an Italian candidate isn‚Äôt drawing outside support due to their heritage. In other words, there are men who want a woman president, *because she‚Äôs a woman.*There are whites who want a black or Hispanic president because they want a minority president. There are minorities who would support another minority. However, there are no non-Italians pining for an Italian President. Being Italian could certainly *lose* a candidate votes, but it‚Äôs not winning any non-Italian votes.

11807,PolarisX,"The 1st half of the question is that all residential services are shared with your neighbors. As in your all share a pool of bandwidth that is divided among X amount of subscribers. That is really only half the puzzle, that means you might be okay, but your neighbor might have a poor experience, since they share with another group. I've been running tests on FiOS once in while (being respectful of possible bandwidth considerations) and still getting gigabit speeds, but I don't have a lot of neighbors on the same ONU (pool) as me from what I can tell. What that does tell me is the links from the headends / Central Offices (where things head out to commercial services) are still in good shape. In the last month 80% of my data consumption was streaming services, but my total usage is really only up a few hundred GB from normal.

Things should hold up, most people are oversubscribed anyways. You can ""get by"" with 20 or 30mbps for most smaller households if it critically comes down to it.

Also if anyone is wondering - streaming, YouTube, screen sharing, video conferencing, and torrenting use a ton of data. Browsing mostly text webpages with normal quality images, and even video games (excluding initial downloads and patches) use very very little data. Also any infected computer can cause a MASSIVE amount of traffic if its being used in a denial of service attack.

TL;DR - Should be okay so far things seem well. Lots of variables including locations, service providers, and service being accessed.",1585188664,flir15s

12040,DaveVsGodzi77a,"Thank you for seeing that Biden is not a real candidate. He is a flawed corporate hack who has fought against the civil rights movement his whole life until doing so was bad for public image and he had to change his tune. Was for segregated bussing, wrote some of the most racist drug prohibition legislation ever drafted and has corporations blatantly pulling his campaign strings. He can‚Äôt even speak a coherent idea without muddling up a few words and looking like a moron.

Pretty sure the reason he won so many southern states is either because the contest is rigged (since the rich corporations who manufacture the electronic voting machines are connected to the corporate entities who contribute massive amounts of money to manipulate politics and it only stands to reason that they will have attempted to have had them programmed to spit out favorable results. {So hopefully covid-19 and sending everyone paper ballots will change things.})

Either that or him confusing his sister and wife on stage struck the heart strings of so many southerners they al flocked to the polling sites for an ancient senile racist candidate that draws crowds of a few hundred people. 

Either way if the race isn‚Äôt blatantly rigged they are still suppressing the vote and doing everything possible to put their thumb on the scales for tired old out of touch confused joe Biden who asks his production team to speed up the  segment because he forgot his lines or can‚Äôt see the TelePrompter  because he is going blind and has a senior moment every moment. AaaBut anyone except Bernie is what we are being given.

If you haven‚Äôt figured it out yet the DNC And RNC -are funded by the same Wall Street banker money who profit immensely from military and prison industry and it‚Äôs multiple intersections into capitalist markets and anyone who threatens their exploitation based profit pyramids is an enemy to their multi trillion dollar empire. Subsequently they will stop at nothing to derail a threat to their order. Which most Americans are an unwitting complicit enforcer of because they are too comfortable to care or do anything to change the social system since it doesn‚Äôt affect them and they‚Äôve been fooled to believing they are the masters of their reality when they are in fact proletariat slaves to the capitalist economy they serve, being given the bare minimum by overpaid executives who spend more on a week vacation than we will ever earn our entire lives and would replace us with slaves if it were legal and will replace everyone with automation when it is cheaper to do so.

And since the DNC and RNC are funded by the same money the DNC would rather see a trump administration than a sanders administration which is why they are so willing to rig the nomination and force a flawed candidate that will loose the primary just like 2016 which was so bad by the way they had to hire people from Craigslist to fill empty audience seats when sanders supporters walked out in protest so they filled the seats with scabs where the a were pointed to make it look like there was party unity because everything is a PR propaganda tactic to make the public think what they have to in order to manufacture our consent to do whatever they want to.

At this point I believe things may be hopeless and our entire government is dirty from top to bottom. So outside of a massive class war idk what will change things and too many Americans are far too comfortable to do anything about the economic and social injustices that have come to have Defined the  American socio-economic spectrum.",1585255174,fll7qg8

    * Economy cannot reopen until testing infrastructure improves. Analogies to South Korea.
    * Trump admin. is directing states to go into private markets for medical supplies. Effectively means every state is competing with every other state and country for the same supplies.
    * Stress on the wide variety of resources required to reach these goals and why it can't be a fast process.
* **General updates**
    * Distance learning for 140,000 students.
    * Remote customer service at DMV, DLT, DHS field offices.
	* $500,000 philanthropic donations and more in donations of supplies.
	* Borrowing $300,000,000 from private market.
	* RI is better off than other states. Still feel as though RI is keeping pace with the spread of the virus, if not a step ahead.
* **Request for individual donations**
    * Family Services putting together wellness packages for needy individuals and families. 
    * Go to [Family Services website](https://www.familyserviceri.org/), call them, or text ""be safe"" to 44321 to donate any food or supples to contribute.
	* Any donation amount by individuals or companies welcome.

I don't think the ACLU is arguing against a mandatory quarantine.  It's not an enforceable thing right now anyhow, it's not like the police are detaining anyone.  They are specifically arguing about the constitutionality (specifically the 4th amendment) of giving the police the ability to pull you over because of your license plate.  

Like I said, I'm not necessarily against this.  The ACLU isn't even suing or taking any action/actively trying to stop it.  They are questioning it.  They want the state to be careful and accountable for possibly violating the rights of citizens.  

I understand the argument for suspending constitutional rights during a crisis.  But that's not what they are arguing.

In the 2008 financial crisis the fed propped up housing prices.

12540,WikiTextBot,"**Marginal utility**

In economics, utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the marginal utility of a good or service is the change in the utility from an increase in the consumption of that good or service.

In the context of cardinal utility, economists sometimes speak of a law of diminishing marginal utility, meaning that the first unit of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. This concept is used by economists to determine how much of a good is a consumer willing to purchase.

Also, read your own damn article

&gt;I think it would be helpful if I cleared up some confusion that has emerged in recent days. Some have interpreted my evidence to a UK parliamentary committee as indicating we have substantially revised our assessments of the potential mortality impact of COVID-19. This is not the case. Indeed, if anything, our latest estimates suggest that the virus is slightly more transmissible than we previously thought. Our lethality estimates remain unchanged. My evidence to Parliament referred to the deaths we assess might occur in the UK in the presence of the very intensive social distancing and other public health interventions now in place. Without those controls, our assessment remains that the UK would see the scale of deaths reported in our study (namely, up to approximately 500 thousand).",1585358420,flpfq6z

Then get a better source than a Breitbart-lite run by a former Breitbart editor.

&gt;Korea and Germany have more widespread testing and have mortality rates of 0.7% and 0.4% respectively.

The Korean and German health care systems are not analogous to our own, especially given the lack of widespread testing at the initial outbreak, lack of medical equipment, lack of health coverage, high costs discouraging people from getting medical attention, etc

&gt;1.5% is only the mortality rate of people in their 60s.

Do their lives not matter?  Incidentally, those are also the people who die the most from the flu.  So it's a fine comparison.

&gt; In addition, 99% of those is Italy who died were also suffering from at least 1 other illness, with half suffering from 3 or more preexisting conditions. Even without COVID many of those dying were already on death's door.

This is an awful argument.

1) The life of someone in their 20s or 30s is not more valuable than someone in their 50s or 60s. 

2) Death is not the only bad outcome from this virus.  Being hospitalized, especially in the US where it can bankrupt you, would lead to the ""homeless suicide"" scenario that started this thread

3) [24.3 million Americans](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190131084238.htm) have some kind of cardiovascular disease. I suppose you will write them off as well.

**So, again, back to my original point**: even if we heartlessly ignore the intrinsic value of the hundreds of thousands, if not more, of Americans who would die if COVID19 was left unchecked, the economic hit we would take would be far worse than if we just hunkered down for a month or two and stamped it out. So even if the only people you care for are the people who would lose their jobs, hunkering down would *STILL* be better than letting those apparently worthless old and sick people die.",1585363591,flpn6zs

It's more complex than your takeaway from the summary. The case is a landmark used in lawsuits for capricious car stops without probable cause. It is the benchmark cases that we use to teach new officers they can't stop cars unless they have articulable reasonable suspicion or probable cause.



Furthermore, once a car is stopped, an officer can't just look the other way on crimes discovered.  Either a stop is illegal and nothing is admissible via fruit of the poisonous tree or it's a valid car stop and police can take enforcement action.

I see the thing as a much lesser version of the people who are getting arrested and getting massive fines for coughing on food in grocery stores. They are knowingly putting other people at risk.

More clearly and specifically, stopping someone because they are a member of a protected class is not akin to stopping them because of the state they come from, New York, during a pandemic, at a stage when our state still believes it can contain infections or strongly mitigate the pace of them. 

The power imbalance just isn't enough.

It's a little more like ""papers, please,"" but also like drunk driving checkpoints, quarantining healthy people on a cruise ship, restricting access to immunocompromised patients in a hospital, and controlling travel based on people's vaccination status. 

The ACLU would and should have responded regardless of how things were phrased in headlines and otherwise. Most other people would not.

More power to the ACLU, who will continue to get my money, especially if they help find and enforce a similarly-effective and less invasive approach.

Maybe. Certainly, in many regions. So far, nursing homes haven't been hit hard (as of a few days ago, last I checked). We have taken measures to make ""everywhere"" not include them.

Going door-to-door, hopefully they are doing so respectfully and informing people of the situation without getting too close. I can't imagine the police are too thrilled about all the contact anyways...

If you're saying  something like ""the situation is has some of the same flaws and problems that of targeting a protected class,"" it makes sense to talk more about arbitrary discrimination.

Most people would say that picking NYers, especially when making efforts to find them where they are getting into the state (which is being done here), is not strictly arbitrary. A point upon which we may very well have to agree to disagree, I think that there is a significant degree to which every knowledgeable and reasonable person considers someone coming in from New York as someone we are justified as singling out in helpful ways, ones that do not violate their rights.

Not letting NYers listen to our radio stations would be arbitrary discrimination. Asking them to let us track them and to quarantine is not. Fining them for failing to quarantine, which we have stated will be targeted at all quarantined people, regardless of the state from which they came, 

It's great if we can make things somehow even less arbitrary (only stop cars at the border, finding ways to include people who are coming from NY but don't have NY plates, etc.). Reducing arbitrariness is a point that does not appear, yet, to be part of your line of reasoning. Though I've given examples, I'm not yet actually making this part of my argument either. If the ACLU can contribute something here, great. They probably are doing so.

You have implied we are stopping them as if they have done something wrong. We have specifically proceeded down a path where someone is not prevented from travel, fined, or aggressively monitored until they do something wrong, like violate quarantine (more than once, for some responses).

If I thought it was the right priority, I would argue that the measures should be for all states meeting a certain measure, rather that just one state that does or a few states that do. In fact, we probably should be taking a look at some MA travel, if we're not already. MA is, though, not the same as NY, because of the number of people commuting between RI and MA.

 Are you not seeing what is going on in the world right now? Hospitals are overwhelmed and everyone is trying to stay at home to try to help the hospitals and save lives. My sister is an ER nurse and I have been laid off because of the shutdown.  Am I selfish for fearing for my sister's safety?  Because ER nurses and doctors are dying from this disease.

NY has 46,000 active cases of coronavirus and NY city has 26,700 of those 46,000. The US has 110,000 cases. So that means about 41.8% cases of the US are from NY.  Due to NY city's dense population, they are estimating that the number is so much higher but because younger people don't show symptoms they just spread it without being tested.  When you travel from NY to RI, that is about 4 to 6 hours depending on where you are NY. You stop for gas, you stop for snacks and food. You come into contact with people during those transactions. You don't have food or cleaning supplies at your vacation home, so now you have to go to store to stock up. Now if you are a carrier you have potentially spread it to all those people who will spread it to their families.

She has a paper gown instead of the 5 layered PPE gear that is recommended. She will be infected with this and hopefully she won't die. Why would I be happy for her to be in this situation?

Gloves are great for keeping YOURSELF germ free. If people are concerned I assure them I'm keeping clean practices, and I encourage people to wear gloves themselves.

A little of both. Every large group of people is going to have some bad apples.

To some extent, I hope the frustration that this creates will spur locals to compete more.

You referenced a single post about lots of out of state cars being at a grocery store. 

We're also mandating anyone coming in by area, from here or not, into quarantine. This is because as a small state our resources are destined to be strained. We don't have enough tests, and we don't have enough ventilators.

I personally have no hate for those from other states. But now is not the time for travel. As you said, everyone's staying home where you are. I hope it stays that way, and hope that continues to become a precedent here.

The key problem is not adding more people to strain our already strained system. That's also why there are exemptions in place for critical care workers coming from out of state, and going out of state.

And honestly, most of us aren't annoyed with our border states, we acknowledge a lot of people live and work near the borders. Like I said, it's people coming to stay here in their vacation homes, and our border states are likely having the same problems.

Quit the dramatics. You're risking your life for a paycheck. The two possible scenarios for the state mandate are that the store is forced to close and you don't get a paycheck or the store is allowed to stay open and you choose to go to work. In the first scenario, you have no choice. In the second (the one currently in place), you can either go to work or tell your boss you're not going in. In the first you take the risk of getting the virus in exchange for a paycheck. In the second you risk losing your job. You choose the risk you take in this situation, which puts you in a better position than someone who makes their living in a flower shop. Not saying the situation is ideal, but the executive order isn't to blame for any risk you take.

So where does 41 beds available come from? That's a good error to have, more available than we think, but I don't know how to trust a source that's getting some basic numbers incorrect.

Then it models deaths ending in a simple curve to zero in 2 months. I see people all around me in the city not distancing at all, playing sports in groups, using the bus to go to work (when they don't have to), going out with their friends, etc. How then do we assume that rosy ending when we'll be getting warmer days and cabin fever will spur people to go out more in the nice weather?

So, unlike influenza A and B which we are fully aware of and prepared to absorb with our heathcare system, this one we are not. 

Next year we probably will be, and we might even beat the curve this year and pull through this with minimum loss of life compatible to normal flu, but only because we are taking the precautions necessary. 

But the dact of the matter is so many people get it so fast, that it runs the risk of depleting hospital beds, not just for covid patients, but for *all* patients, which means, if your loved one gets in a car accident they are in just as bad of shape and anyone with the flu because the resources wont be there to help them. 

The whole ""i wont comply"" thing is akin to someone hoarding rations durring WW2 because ""gubberment cant tell me what to do!""

The fact of the matter is when faced with a crisis, like war, famine, or pandemic the citizens of a country need to band together and fallow uncomfortable guidlines from the government for the survival of the nation. You are basically a draft dodger. 

So, when this is over if these temporary mesures begin to wear out their welcome and gina tries to codify them, i would love to see you fighting against it with me at the statehouse, but right now, durring a crisis, we have to fallow directions and do whats best for our state and the well being of its citizens.

I have no idea if they shut down nationally all at once; but I don‚Äôt believe any states had done a quarantine yet at that point.  

As for your comradery in opposing peacetime government overreach, I do appreciate the gesture.   
My concern is about ‚Äúpattern normalization‚Äù more than codifying an indefinite quarantine or something crazy.   

I suspect quarantines will become more and more regular and normalized with any sign of outbreak, along with social distancing and masks etc.  

A paradigm shift is in the air, and I don‚Äôt like the direction; not only of government reaction, but even more of general public sentiment and public acceptance/advocacy of such a direction.  

If find the response of the general public, and especially of the general vibe on this forum, to be siding too far with technocracy to the point of democratically giving up democracy to technocrats.  

(Your engagement places you in a separate category than what I called ‚Äúgeneral vibe‚Äù.

They should mail you some paperwork sometime next week that shows what your weekly benefit rate is (based on your average pay over the last couple of quarters), your pin code for when you tell them you've gone back to work and a form your doctor will need to fill out (why we can't print that one ourselves I will never know. It's not like they have a lot of different forms that the end user fills out) and submit themselves. Once that happens, you're a step closer to payment and on the way officially. Then its just a matter of waiting, healing and not running out of money before the initial lump sum shows up. After that, it'll be deposited  weekly on the same day until you call to stop it or go part time. FYI- don't go part time, it's a pain in the ass and not worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always gotten 3 letters, dated/postmarked on the same day- the 1st telling me my claim has been received, the 2nd telling my claim has been denied for lack of information and the 3rd informing me that my claim has been approved and payment is on the way. I usually get them after the initial lump sum shows up in my bank account. 2 other coworkers have had the same experience in the last year.  It's a bit surreal to be honest and reminds me of this Simpsons [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rdL5pKvsss).

&amp;#x200B;

None of the benefit payment is taxable so you don't have to worry about it next year. But the DLT will will send you a form that you have to report to the IRS as part of your taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is no way to get to the front of the line or even find out where you are in said line, they will process your paperwork when they process your paperwork. With the recent pandemic, I suspect the wait time will be longer with more claims being filed but that's just my guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any forms you have to submit (if you go p/t for example there's a paper time card like form you have to send them weekly), fax them in. That way you know they showed up in a timely manner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't call them unless you need absolutely positively without a doubt have to talk to a human (ie going back part time), the hours are odd and the wait times have been ungodly in my experience (3-5 hrs is typical).

But, when you pour a ton of pension money into your own fund, and it ends up being a terrible investment that results in people‚Äôs retirements being destroyed in many cases....yeah, you can go fuck yourself.

The International Fuel Tax Agreement (or IFTA) is an agreement between the lower 48 states of the United States and the Canadian provinces, to simplify the reporting of fuel use by motor carriers that operate in more than one jurisdiction. Alaska, Hawaii, and the Canadian territories are not required to participate, however all of Canada and Alaska do.  An operating carrier with IFTA receives an IFTA license and two decals for each qualifying vehicle it operates. The carrier files a quarterly fuel tax report.

I stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn't believe it. Reactivity I said: ""Are you fucking kidding me!? Are you serious right now? REALLY!?""

14806,Boxer_Twin,"Reasons people dislike Gina (not exhaustive):

\-she screwed the pension fund and has personally profited off of it for more than a decade.  It makes her more money annually than her Governor's salary, regardless of fund performance.

\-she is very unfriendly towards gun owners; people who make up a significant portion of the population, btw.  This one always gets political, but if you can bite your tongue read on: in general RI has fairly stringent gun laws.  The gun show loopholes, private sales, yadda yadda don't happen here like they do in (some) other states (that's sort of besides the point, anyways; 2/3 of gun deaths are suicides and after that a lot of gun violence is concentrated in poor urban areas with gang violence by handguns).  Handguns account for over 95% of gun deaths.  Her attempts at restricting firearm ownership and firearm type ownership do not reflect statistical imperatives.  RI has a reasonably low rate of gun violence.  In fact, the entire country has had a slight decline in per capita gun violence over the last half century despite vastly increased reporting.  She did try to add an additional 10% tax to firearms and ammo (for a total of 17% TAX).  The extra 10% would be given to police departments who would give it to nonviolence organizations, ergo putting the onus of nonviolence funding on responsible firearms enthusiasts.  She also tried to backdoor a gun registry by getting the state police to keep records of all gun sales on a monthly basis, presumably to create a list of doors to knock on when her golden calf of an ""assault"" weapons ban comes to fruition.  Think that sounds crazy?  Southern states have used a similar legislative approach to shut down abortion clinics before court challenges can be upheld.

\-Cooler and Warmer was a bust.  Had she just wasted 5 million dollars that would have been one thing, but the fact that it made it to the public before her administration realized it was complete crap and then they tried to roll back on it showed great ineptitude.

\-She is always stretching the budget and then looking for ways to raise revenue or cut funding.  Look at the attempt to raise the recently lowered state beach fees or the drastic funding cuts at the newly built Veterans' Home.

\-The truck tolls were unpopular and people are rightfully concerned that tolling could be expanded given her budgetary approaches.

\-Gina and Fung did nothing but sling mud at each other in their first race.  It's no wonder Bob Healey nearly won with a campaign budget of about $40.  That campaign showed that Rhode Islanders were nearly equally disgusted with Gina and Fung's political ambitions.  This brings me to my final point

\-it seems to me that Gina Raimondo's decisions are colored by political ambition and her desire for authority.  Why is Charlie Baker so popular?  He doesn't cast shade on other people and he shows up to do his job.  Maybe you don't agree with him, but at least he isn't posturing.  Why did Gina endorse Bloomberg?  Maybe because he gave her campaign a bunch of money, or maybe because she was hoping at a shot for the VP nomination?  The way she addressed the public about gathering in large groups the other day ('if you keep it up I'll have to force a lockdown; knock it off') had the tone of somebody on a power trip.  She was talking to her constituents like they were children to be bossed around.  This perceived desire to climb the political ladder and her lust for power makes people question the genuineness of her decisions.

In all seriousness you aren‚Äôt allowed to criticize the homeless to any extent in this sub or you will be downvoted and censored.

Examples of criticism not allowed:

-Why are the homeless still allowed to break social distancing guidelines when this is a pandemic?


-With 95% of shops closed, and free food and board available and many resources to guide them, why do they need CASH? (which is riddled with germs)


-How is it that the homeless seem to have PPE (gloves/masks) when our good doctors and nurses are in desperate need of supply?


-Why are police not enforcing clearing up red lights and stop signs and very thin medians on public roadways that are obstructed by panhandlers but are willing to shut down gyms, beaches, and parks?


-With less commuter traffic, and fewer cars on the roadway (hey Ginas stop and question out-of-state drivers) why are police not looking for Heroin, Crack, and Meth dealers, aka the people who seem to have a ton of foot traffic at their homes in light of a plague?",1585728192,fm3lv8v

&gt;Mass. should lead the way on virus immunity tests - The Boston Globe
Shirley Leung
5-6 minutes
&gt;
But we still have a chance to get the second half right. With judicious use of blood tests that could become available this spring, it‚Äôs possible to determine who has already been exposed to the virus and doesn‚Äôt have to fear returning to work or school or caring for people who are sick.
&gt;

&gt;
Given the biomedical firepower in this region, Massachusetts should lead the way in rolling out blood tests at a massive scale. While scientists here and elsewhere are racing to perfect these new tests, Governor Charlie Baker‚Äôs administration needs to be planning now for a fast deployment of thousands or even millions of them.
&gt;
Researchers in Germany, where coronavirus death rates are surprisingly low, have such ambitions in mind as they develop a viable test. They intend to test 100,000 people for antibodies in their blood that would indicate a past infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The researchers suggest that people who have those antibodies could get certificates that would exempt them from restrictions on public life. At the very least, government officials will be able to rely on the data as evidence for loosening social distancing restrictions. Something similar, albeit on a much smaller scale, is happening in Telluride, Colo., and its surrounding county thanks to local biotech executives who donated test kits.
&gt;
Diagnosing live cases of COVID-19 typically requires a swab from your nose or throat. That swab is then analyzed for genetic material belonging to the coronavirus. However, that method doesn‚Äôt determine if someone already has had the virus and recovered ‚Äî an experience that sometimes produces no symptoms or mild ones. Nasal swab tests also sometimes fail to detect active cases because infected patients eventually stop shedding the virus in their noses.
&gt;
Blood tests for viral antibodies generally can be administered with a pinprick on your finger. Usually within minutes, they can detect the existence of antibodies that the immune system produces to respond to a virus.
&gt;
But creating such a test for a new disease like COVID-19 is tricky. Scientists need time to confirm that they can reliably detect antibodies that are specific for COVID-19 and not for other viruses. Follow-up research is also necessary to determine the antibody level in the bloodstream that is necessary to confer immunity and just how long the immunity lasts.
&gt;
One of the labs doing such work is led by Galit Alter of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and MIT. Alter is collaborating with MGH researchers who have been hustling to validate commercially made antibody tests and ones developed in-house, and she hopes local institutions can begin offering blood tests within a week or two.
&gt;
What would it take to increase the chances that happens and can be scaled up? ‚ÄúWe just need resources and access,‚Äù Alter says. ‚ÄúWe can only move as fast as our money and time can stretch out.‚Äù But while her group has gotten some crucial philanthropic support, ‚Äúwe just haven‚Äôt heard anything from government about this, nor have we received any support.‚Äù
&gt;
The governor‚Äôs office, or the command center set up by Baker, could help such efforts. If Baker elevated the subject of immunity tests into his regular briefings, he might inspire more philanthropic contributions and other collaborations. He could prepare the public for the prospect of widespread blood testing. He also might prepare his own administration for that, because it‚Äôs not clear that it has plans to obtain or facilitate antibody tests at a mass scale. Would existing testing locations be up to handle that, or would new ones be needed? How will public health officials document and follow up on positive immunity tests? How might such data inform Baker‚Äôs future decisions on loosening ‚Äî or reinstating ‚Äî social distancing?
&gt;
Baker has been understandably frustrated by the federal government‚Äôs shambolic response to the pandemic, which has undermined the state‚Äôs ability to obtain ventilators for hospitals and protective equipment for doctors and nurses. He is trying to ensure the state is prepared for the expected surge in coronavirus cases beginning next week.
&gt;
But managing a crisis demands thinking ahead and planning for several steps at a time. There‚Äôs still time to devise a system for antibody testing that makes Massachusetts a model for the rest of the nation, and that helps everyone return to our regular lives as soon as it‚Äôs safe.",1585753367,fm4fyet

you'd need a lot of planning, like at what point do you need a hospital transfer if things aren't progressing? what transportation do you have and who will be meeting you on the other end? are you sure your midwife is accredited through the proper institutions and can communicate with a hospital or pcp if you need to be transferred? there's no guarantee you won't have to go to the hospital because nobody can predict the future and know how smoothly your delivery will go but if you're worried then it might be a way to reduce the chances of having to be there.

there's no ""right"" choice here and I don't want to act like home birth is superior or a better idea right now because it's not, it's just a different way to do things. neither one is ideal and I'm very sorry you're in this situation, but I hope everything goes well for both yourself and the baby",1585764930,fm524ux

15178,Killjoy4eva,"&gt;PROVIDENCE -- Amid heightened concerns that the novel coronavirus could sweep through the state‚Äôs prison population and further overwhelm Rhode Island‚Äôs healthcare system and imperil corrections officers, the state Department of Corrections and the governor are backing a move by the Rhode Island Public Defender‚Äôs office to **release prisoners with 90 or less left to serve**

&gt;‚ÄúWhile this is ultimately a decision for the courts, the Governor and RIDOC agree with the spirit of this motion and would be supportive of releasing certain inmates, as long as public health precautions are taken. This would help mitigate the risk of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in our facilities and create additional space if necessary,‚Äù corrections spokesman J.R. Ventura said in an email statement.

&gt;The statement released late Wednesday came two days after the Rhode Island Public Defender‚Äôs office filed an emergency petition asking that the state Supreme Court issue an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù order directing Superior and District court judges to release inmates facing 90 days or less behind bars. Acting Public Defender Matthew Toro argued such relief was necessary as ‚ÄúPrison outbreaks imperil us all.‚Äù

&gt;In its petition, the office proposed the creation a process allowing prosecutors to object to the release of any prisoner if there was a concern that he or she would present a significant risk to public safety and a hearing held.

&gt;The corrections statement released Wednesday **called for any potential release to be limited only to eligible nonviolent offenders, the vast majority of whom will be under probation supervision**, Ventura said.",1585778046,fm5qodq

Most workers covered under CBAs are union members. It's possible to have a CBA without a union but it's not very common.

Currently, the national labor relations board recognizes three types of employees: 

1. Employees at will (most jobs, no protection)
2. Employees protected under a CBA/Union
3. Employees engaged in organizing a union (some NLRA protection, especially around employer retaliation)

For essential employees getting the isht end of the stick, it might be in a good time to reach out to a union to get organized. Even if starting now puts you a year or longer out from negotiating the first CBA, it seems like it would be worth getting your butt in the #3 employee seat.",1585829828,fm7kblv

The only thing in the way of us being totally overwhelmed is our compliance with social distancing.  We're only 50 - 60 % compliant, and you're in the bad 40%, or you were until saturday.  

I can relate to what a fucking pain in the ass this is with kids.  I have a three year old at home, and he desperately wants to play with his friends, but he's not allowed to.  He doesn't see anyone in person.  And it sucks.  We go outside, to isolated places and run around, and get him exercise.  He goes on video chats a little, but he'd love nothing more than to be playing with others. My wife and I are both working from home, and it's nigh on impossible to get shit done, but that's what has to happen right now. I'd like to see people too.  The quarantine is useless, if kids are playing together.  Kids are disease magnets, and your innocent little neighborhood play comprises a cluster of likely hundreds of contacts. 

So it's a pain in the ass.  It's not being rationed for years like my parents were in WW2.   It's not fleeing the holocaust.  It's about doing some tough parenting and eating some shit for a couple months.  You did the wrong thing letting your kids play with other kids before saturday, because guidance hasn't changed on this point, at all, in weeks.  I'm glad you have seen sense.

Everyone else putting pressure on you to join their selfish negligence is contributing to health care workers getting sick and dying, as well as all sorts of other people in our community, especially the vulnerable.  They lack an appreciation for how severe this issue is, and I hope it doesn't have to hit home for them for them to get it.

**Gov. Raimondo**

* 2 new deaths, total of 14
* 54 new cases, total of 711
* 72 hospitalized - keeping an eye firmly on hospitalization number
* Hospitalization rate is climbing rapidly, rapid spread of virus in RI
* We must get serious about the rules in place regarding social distancing, washing hands, and quarantine.
   * We all need to do better

&amp;#x200B;

* We are working hard to make sure we have enough hospital beds for when the surge hits
* We have some time to ready ourselves
* **Army Corps of Engineers and Nat. Guard evaluating sites for additional hospital beds**
   * **Sites that have been identified - RI Convention Center, Former Citizens Bank Building in Cranston, Former Lowes building in Quonset**
   * Those 3 sites alone will yield over 1,000 beds
   * Work is underway to secure staffing and proper equipment
   * Herculean effort
* Hospitals are putting plans in place to take care of additional patients, doing great work
* Asking for help from retired nurses, doctors, etc. We will be able to pay you for doing this lifesaving work
   * [RIresponds.org](https://RIresponds.org)

&amp;#x200B;

* Many are still not complying with social distancing orders
* **Stay at home order issued to all of RI**
   * Go out quickly and occasionally, once a week to pharmacy and grocery store
   * If you must work, go to work and come home
   * If you work in another state, you must stay in your home when you get back
* Checking on grocery stores, big box stores - too many people in the store, too many standing close together
* RI has been shown to be less compliant than MA and national average
* **We do not have enough ventilators if the surge hits sooner than we think, or if the peak is higher than expected**
   * **People will die**
* If you are out there pushing the limits, you are hurting other people and you are making it more difficult for us to reopen the economy
   * Stories of businesses struggling or going under are not funny, they are heartbreaking

&amp;#x200B;

* Childcare licenses will continue to be suspended through the month of April
   * We have not found a safe solution to this problem. We are not giving up.
   * Referral to [care.com](https://care.com), work within your social network to try to make it through the next few weeks
* [RIdelivers.com](https://RIdelivers.com) is overwhelmed, over 40,000 requests in one day
   * We need that service for the elderly and people who are in quarantine
   * The only way to stay in quarantine effectively is if we can provide a delivery service for food and medicine
   * If you have someone in your family that can shop for you, let them do it for you
   * Do not break your quarantine to get food
* SBA Payroll Protection Loan Program is up and running as of today
   * If your business is struggling with finances, submit an application through your bank as quickly as you can
   * 521-HELP
* Mental Illness referral services
   * 414-LINK for adults
   * 855-543-5465 for kids
   * 5 million dollar fund for COVID-19 related mental health issues through the RI Foundation

15801,Beezlegrunk,"&gt; I think it's actually more about total population, all those states have .5-1.5 million people.

I think you‚Äôre probably right ‚Äî plus, states with low populations tend to have just one (or at most two) big population centers, so those criteria are conjoined.

&gt; Since states don't appear on the chart until they've hit 200+ cases, states with smaller populations are grouped together at the top of the chart since 200 cases is a way higher proportion of the population for RI than it is for CA or TX.

It would helpful if the data lines had a unique symbol for their endpoints, because it‚Äôs hard to see if there are many state in the middle who are at the same point past 200 cases. That said, someone else pointed out that it could largely be a function of testing ‚Äî the more you test, the more you find.

&gt; Edited to add: to actually see how we stack up in terms of per capita cases you need to look at the whole graph... looks like we're somewhere around 10th behind NY, NJ, LA, MA, CO and some others. A lot of the midwestern/ southern/ plains states are trailing a few days to a week behind us as well. *I actually feel like this graph made me feel like we've been doing a good job here*.

I read it differently, in that our *relatively* high numbers are disproportionate to our other metrics, and indicate either interactions with people from bigger places with worse conditions (MA / Boston and New York), or our poor compliance with the stay-at-home order, or both. We‚Äôre doing better than those other places you mentioned, but not as much better as we should be, given our size and ‚Äúdays past 200‚Äù. Something‚Äôs tweaking our numbers ‚Ä¶",1585942079,fmcaplr

15888,CivilCJ,"Nice ghost edit there, I wouldn't have avoided the question if it was there in the first place.  But I'd be happy to answer you.  The short version is the economy can take a back seat on this one.  People's lives are far more important than the economy.  If there are no people, there's no economy.  Yes, that's some good ol fashioned hyperbole but the point holds.  Now, let's say we we're pretty relaxed with our quarantine and people basically treat it like a month's vacation since we're not taking it seriously.  Worst case scenario about half a million to a million people die.  Do you want the economy to be spurred on by funerals, medical bills and real estate liquidation?  Small business owners are usually the ones bitching about the economy, do you think people are going to want to buy frivolous things when they're paying off their $1300 covid test or burying their grandmother?  The economy is going to take a hit either way, might as well take it as serious as possible to minimize as much damage as possible.

So serious means taking every possible preventive measure to combat the virus, focus resources to the medical, sanitation and transportation
Industries, and not giving a single grain of leeway to the idiots ignoring these protocols.  We can celebrate the recovered once it's over, but it's far from over.

RI citizens took major time and inconvenience out of their day, or left work, showed up to the state house to demonstrate against totalitarian gun restrictions. Very large crowds for such a small state equaling similar numbers in much larger states. Several thousand signing up, willing to speak before the legislature themselves. 

 I remember holding a sign 'come and take it' with a pic of an ar, standing right by the street in front of the state house.

What I think the strategy should be is to isolate and quarantine those people who would be susceptible to the virus killing them. A far smaller and easier amount of people to deal with, and we wouldn't have to shut everything down. Again, not against their will though.

There is a point where doing long term damage to the future of everyone is just not worth it for what this statistically, and in reality is.

We don't need any harsher precautions, what you're calling for is not something we want. You're not thinking where this could lead.  what we're doing is unprecedented already and if its going to work this should do it. The amount of contact between people is so small now.

Unless you're rooting for people being welded into their houses? Forcibly dragged away? What about sick people with no support who run out of food, just die in your home where I don't have to see it?

Consider this- You or someone in your family could already have this virus. You may not show symptoms for a couple of days.

&gt;Some individuals may want to use common fabric materials for respiratory protection because of shortage or affordability reasons. To address the filtration performance of common fabric materials against nano-size particles including viruses, five major categories of fabric materials including sweatshirts, T-shirts, towels, scarves, and cloth masks were tested for polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols (20‚Äì1000 nm) at two different face velocities (5.5 and 16.5 cm s‚àí1) and compared with the penetration levels for N95 respirator filter media. The results showed that cloth masks and other fabric materials tested in the study had 40‚Äì90% instantaneous penetration levels against polydisperse NaCl aerosols employed in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health particulate respirator test protocol at 5.5 cm s‚àí1. Similarly, varying levels of penetrations (9‚Äì98%) were obtained for different size monodisperse NaCl aerosol particles in the 20‚Äì1000 nm range. The penetration levels of these fabric materials against both polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols were much higher than the penetrations for the control N95 respirator filter media. At 16.5 cm s‚àí1 face velocity, monodisperse aerosol penetrations slightly increased, while polydisperse aerosol penetrations showed no significant effect except one fabric mask with an increase. Results obtained in the study show that common fabric materials may provide marginal protection against nanoparticles including those in the size ranges of virus-containing particles in exhaled breath.",1586004331,fmehraq

I'm in a weird situation here:

Right before this started I got a job offer in MA.

On March 13th I signed a lease for an apartment in Quincy, then a couple days later the quarentines started.

So the past couple weeks I've been periodically traveling to my new apartment to bring supplies and assemble furniture, but the process is very slow because of slow shipping times. Thus the apartment is mostly empty.

My new job has been having me work from home since I started, but I am concerned if they do call me in I won't be able to get there.


So I am wondering, worst case scenario, if Gina ""shuts it all down"", does that mean I won't be able to move into my new apartment? Or report for work if they call me in?


The new employer did give me an official document stating I was 'essential', but I am worried maybe that's for Massachusetts only...",1586131974,fmjk6zo

Oh, yes it does. Your accusations of ""authoritarianism"" falls flat when you're devoid of any and all empathy when it comes to people in iron petri dishes (e.g. prisons). My ""political view"" on this is simple: I want them released to prevent disease transmission. Anne Frank died of disease, not in a gas chamber.

Nice assumption, I'm not a ""yuppie."" I'm not from Providence. Not everyone you disagree with is an ""elite urban progressive."" Maybe stop ""othering"" people? It's not a good way to get your point across.

&gt; You do know the border is closed right? If we release them according to the same logic they should return to their country of origin, right?

Many people detained in the country have been here for years, this is their home. Again, another baseless assumption.

The qPCR test involves a deep nasal swab.

This CVS test involves the following:

&gt;While the patient remains in their vehicle, a sample of nasal secretions will be collected by carefully inserting the swab into the nostril exhibiting the most visible drainage, or the nostril that is most congested if drainage is not visible. The swab is inserted approximately 1 inch into the nasal passage. In many cases, the patient will be asked to perform this swabbing themselves.

Honestly, I don't feel like my monthly checkup is important enough to play ""Russian roulette"" as my husband put it. If I were high risk it may be a different story, but I'm not willing to go to my monthly appointment at this point in time. It's my choice, and I'm choosing to avoid any exposure at all. 

Like you mentioned, other states are allowing telehealth appointments for non-essential appoints like our monthly visits are. There is no reason this shouldn't be an option for all providers for non-essential visits. I have no idea how other OBs in RI are handling monthly visits. I just wanted to let you know my provider is also trying to get me to come in, despite the fact that leaving the house at all poses a possible risk.

As I said, I will be cancelling my appointment because I refuse to put myself at any risk. If my provider chooses to dismiss me as a patient that is alright, there are other OB's. If my provider can't respect the fact I want to avoid any exposure at all, they probably aren't the right provider for me in the long run anyway. As long as one has accurate means of checking BP and the baby is moving around as usual there is really no medical reason a non-essential appointment can't be skipped to avoid possible Covid exposure.

16751,tfabDuck,"Am about a week ahead of you and went to what would typically be my last monthly appointment last week. Doc mentioned that with normal/healthy/low-risk pregnancies, they are comfortable spreading out the remaining appointments. 

For me, that meant we scheduled an appointment two-weeks out in case I had concerns arise/want to continue the typical schedule but I am welcome to (and will likely) cancel it and not go in again until 2 weeks after that. My growth scan is scheduled for 3 weeks later, and I'll see a doctor right after the scan.

Tldr: instead of moving to two-week appointments, I'll have one a month out, and then three weeks out. After that, we'll probably reassess?",1586196425,fmm0bif
