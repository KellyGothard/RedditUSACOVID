NMSU's Engineering program is decent and all but finding any kind of nice job in Las Cruces is a nightmare. Good luck finding anything related to your field. Your options besides the usual food service, retail, etc. are basically work at NMSU (they don't care about their employees), work for the city or public schools (old folks are holding on to the good jobs so you have to hope someone is retiring, and the schedules won't be very flexible for full-time students), or you can work 30 minutes outside of town at White Sands Missile Range or NASA White Sands (hopefully you are fortunate enough to be former military with a security clearance, otherwise forget about it).

What is your concern? That the terrorist was killed or a possible destabilization? My point is that your concern about a dead terrorist is unfounded, but a concern about destabilization is legitimate. I also feel that you are being manipulated to that concern by anti-trump sources. 

Obama didn't achieve peace with Iran by trying to be friendly with them. Iran act like the kind of bullies that Trump is. When a big bully stand up to a little bully the little bully usually backs down. It's a real gamble of policy for sure. But if it ends up being effective, why shouldn't I support that?  Currently we don't know if this was a mistake or winning play. What we do know is every anti-trump outlet are saying the exact same things Iran is saying, and that should give you pause.

When it comes to Iran, I feel that if they choose to poke the bear, the bear needs to respond. I feel that Iran took advantage of Obama's willingness to get along. I feel they would keep testing Trump until Trump responded. I'm pretty certain Trump did not go looking for a way to distract from impeachment, as I keep getting told by media.  He responded to Iran's behavior. 

If this escalates, there is no way Trump doesn't take full blame on this. Which is also why I think he has an end game.

It would be so lovely to have some sort of informal community (centered around NKBA) because where we are now, politics and very rural location keep us from having any friends.   
My husband taught permaculture in Georgia and FL for many years so we were really excited to see some things happening in the videos we found...How active is the farm end of it? We've talked about owning something with less land if he had a place to do work/volunteer/farm etc. so that seems ideal... Does the farm mostly feed people who visit the ashram or is it a market garden?   
I feel like if this is the right move, everything will fall into place. Taos already looks 1000 times better than the little town we go to...plus cool people...

This is possible, but I make my judgement based on odds, because I just don;t know you. Your posting on site that in my experience is very liberal and discounts most views that contradict their world view. Your comments are pretty much in line with those, so I make assumptions. You've made your point, and I'll take you for your word. I voted for Gary Johnson because I have an issue with Trumps temperament.  But watching the russia / mueller show has shown me very much that Trump is not being treated fairly. So I've become more open to his defense like I would most other people who were treated unfairly.

I don't fully disagree with this. But at the same time, Iran needs to face consequences when it sponsors terrorism, and the UN won't do anything about it.  I understand your feeling that this assassination hurts our status, but at the same time I feel that drawing a red line in the sand with Syria and backing down hurt our status just as much. In fact the backing down emboldens terrorists. In my view, the weakness of Obama was more dangerous than the bully of Trump.

The Clinton team needed an excuse for losing the election. And to do that they were willing to antagonize the other major nuclear power. Never any thought for anything but themselves. 

It's more than our status that is hurt by this assassination. It's our ability to use diplomacy and avoid violence. Every time we use violence, and especially in a way like this, we provide an excuse for everyone and anyone else who wants to use violence. Yes, at times violence is unavoidable. But we use it as a first resort instead of a last resort. Having a huge standing military will do that. 

What's really disgusting about Syria is that the war is over a pipeline. I can't remember if we want it built and the Russians don't or the other way around. But it's not about any of the things we're being told it's about. These endless wars are all about empire.",1578613767,fdovfh3

State is known for its Agri sciences, it's got a great engineering program although UNM is pretty on par and its sciences are all great programs from what I've heard. I went through chemical engineering and enjoyed my experience, classes were small and close knit and I knew my professors and the faculty personally, sometimes getting drinks with them at local bars.

UNM has more opportunities in liberal arts and humanities but their biology and chemistry departments were strong while I was going through them, and while NMSU has a med school now, UNM's is more established and higher ranked.

The main reason I transferred was the people. UNM felt very clique-y. It seemed like everyone had come from their Albuquerque high school with already formed friend groups and it was hard to get into my freshman year. I ended up making friends my sophomore year before transferring but the people at state were much more inviting and 3 years after graduating I'm in constant contact with my core friend group from State.

Both schools party, but Albuquerque is a better city to drink in with more bars and clubs, only problem is you've got to wait till you turn 21, or get a good fake ID, to take advantage of it.

These trainings emphasized pretty obviously that relationships that overlap with power imbalances are a RED FLAG and should not be pursued (even ones that are not formalized -- e.g. any TA still has more power than any student, even if they are not MY student). This was hammered home in the trainings even for TAs/RAs who have exponentially less power than professors. He must have been aware that his behavior was not in line with these trainings.

This should be especially obvious to a professor in the school of MANAGEMENT where I would hope they would be aware of the inherent problems with subordinate/supervisor relationships.

Not true at all. It's because they cover me for pregnancy, even though I'm a man. It's because they took the decision making out of my hands and gave it to companies. The excessive overhead of obamacare plus the taxing of medical to pay for medical all contributed to the raise in costs. It's not just Insurance companies bending us over, The government directed the insurance companies to do it. 

The rich own something like 86% of the stock market.

So fucking what. The bulk of my retirement is in the stock market too.  I want it to do well so I can enjoy my retirement.  That also has nothing to do with personal income taxes.  Notice the low unemployment numbers? I'll take companies getting tax breaks and hiring every day over taxing them and having them ship jobs to China. 

&gt;You really need to stop insisting I said things I didn't say. That's a counter-productive pain in the ass, it's disrespectful, and it's dishonest.

You got a tax cut. I can show  you if you want to show me all you personal stuff, but I assume that's off the table for very good reason. 

I agree I also find it rude to tell me things that aren't true. I'm assuming you'll be honest with me, but you are not at this point.

I'm not defending what Obama did, or didn't do, in Syria. 

But I'm in no position to lay out a plan for solving the mess in the middle east. Laying that at my feet is ridiculous. 

We're attacked all the time. We're at war. We have been how long now? 18 years?

Am I supposed to take special umbrage this time because the attack was on our embassy in Iraq? 

Where we are an occupying force? 

Is that the unacceptable offense? 

What makes that so unacceptable compared to any other attack? 

In this endless mess of destruction and depravity? 

Because non-military personnel who I assume knew the risk when they agreed to work there were killed, I am supposed to be extra-super-offended? 

Why are those deaths so much more offensive than all the other deaths? 

&gt;You are correct I know nothing of your tax situation. But Trumps bill gave tax cuts to most, and closed loopholes. That is a good thing, no matter how much you whine about it.

You asked me why I had no faith in Trump. I answered. Then you rejected my answer and called me a liar. Now you're calling me a whiner. 

Hey why don't you go fuck yourself?

&gt;It's not just Insurance companies bending us over, The government directed the insurance companies to do it.

I never said it was just the insurance companies. They aren't the only pigs feeding at the trough. But if you think the insurance companies are only reaming us because the government ""directed"" them too, then you are floating around in outer space. You think the insurance companies would stop overcharging if the government would only let them? 

Those virtuous insurance companies! Forced to debase themselves at government command!

And how is it possible that the government both (a) took the decision making from you and gave it to the insurance companies; and (b) ordered those companies to ream us against their will? In that scenario, the insurance companies both have the decision making, and also don't have it. 

Is your head on backwards after spinning around like that?

&gt;That also has nothing to do with personal income taxes. 

You were the one who said ""the bulk went to business"" about the Trump tax cuts. When business taxes are cut, the rich benefit way more than the rest of us. If you can't grasp that, then as they say, there's no cure for stupid. 

&gt;Notice the low unemployment numbers? 

Notice that people are working multiple jobs and still can't pay their bills?

Notice that the wage gains have primarily been among jobs that already paid well?

Notice that for most workers wages remain flat?

Notice that housing costs and healthcare costs and the cost of higher education are ruining lives?

Notice that for most Americans this economy sucks ass?

&gt;I'll take companies getting tax breaks and hiring every day over taxing them and having them ship jobs to China.

Two separate things: taxes on income, and wages. 

They ship jobs to China to pay lower wages. 

So how do the tax breaks keep jobs here?

&gt;You got a tax cut. I can show you if you want to show me all you personal stuff, but I assume that's off the table for very good reason.

Of course that's off the table. 

I would never, not in a million years, even consider telling you that I know better than you do about your personal finances, or any other aspect of your life. 

I would never do that because there's no way I could possibly know better than you. 

And I would never do that because it lacks basic human decency.

496,496,responsible4self,"&gt; You brought up Syria. If you're saying I'm using it as a distraction, then that's some pure bullshit.

I thought you could follow my train of thought. Maybe I wasn't clear. It's really easy to criticize, not so easy to provide a solution. You keep telling me what Trump did was wrong and implying a diplomatic solution should be better.  I brought up Syria because Obama was praised as a diplomat and put forth as an example of how we should act in the world. Yet Syria showed that getting a long and diplomacy doesn't always work. I'm prodding you to provide what you would support as a solution. 

&gt;We're attacked all the time. We're at war. We have been how long now? 18 years?

This is a problem with communication. We aren't at war with Iran, and if we were, then there is no issue with what Trump did. Words matter.  Since we aren't at war, we shouldn't have to put up with Iran attacking us.  How easy is it for you to sit back and criticize what others are doing and offering no solutions? You chose to engage in this conversation, speak up. If you can criticize, then you must know a better way, or you shouldn't be criticizing. 

&gt;You asked me why I had no faith in Trump. I answered.

The answer you gave me was factually wrong. You have no faith in someone who you think did something he didn't do.  That's misguided in my view. The tax law says you got a tax break. It's really hard for me to believe you didn't get a tax cut when it was across the board. When I called you on it you told me I didn't understand income tax. 

&gt;Hey why don't you go fuck yourself?

Exactly what I was thinking when you claimed to not get a tax break, but I thought that was too over the top and would try and get a better understanding. I couldn't imaging saying that and expecting to get a reasonable response. Normally I just report these to the mods, but I'll let it slide this time. 

&gt;You think the insurance companies would stop overcharging if the government would only let them?

Absolutely not. But by allowing them to write obamacare, this is what we got. 

&gt;(a) took the decision making from you and gave it to the insurance companies;

Only certain policies approved by the government can be sold.  That took my decision making away. - Government mandated that. 

&gt;(b) ordered those companies to ream us against their will? 

The insurance company is over charging me because I'm being charged for coverage I won't need or use. That was mandated by your point A.

&gt; When business taxes are cut, the rich benefit way more than the rest of us. 

You mean those who own the business or invest in the business. Not all of those people are rich. I own stock, I'm far from rich. Again we are at record low unemployment. That means businesses are hiring. That's a good thing.

&gt;Notice that people are working multiple jobs and still can't pay their bills?

Outside of depressed New Mexico, no I do not. 

&gt;Notice that the wage gains have primarily been among jobs that already paid well?

Do you understand how percentages work?

&gt;Notice that the wage gains have primarily been among jobs that already paid well?

&gt;Notice that for most workers wages remain flat?

&gt;Notice that housing costs and healthcare costs and the cost of higher education are ruining lives?

&gt;Notice that for most Americans this economy sucks ass?

No. Look outside of New Mexico. You can't blame New Mexican issues on Trump.

&gt;They ship jobs to China to pay lower wages.

Yes, that's globalism. You may have not noticed, but Trump is fighting that. He has provided incentives for companies to hire Americans. Between Tariffs and tax cuts, he is making it more attractive to be an american company. 

&gt;Of course that's off the table.
I know it is, that's why I wrote it. There is no way you should tell me anything about your personal finances, which left us with he said she said over taxes.

500,500,FormerlyTusconian,"&gt; You keep telling me what Trump did was wrong and implying a diplomatic solution should be better.

My preferred solution would be say to Iraq ""sorry for the mess"" and get the hell out of there. I was actually thinking that if retaliation was decided on, there had to be a better way to do it. The way this was done just strikes me as obvious and inviting trouble. 

And after everything we've done to the Iraqi people, most of whom have never done anything to us, here we go yet again adding yet more stress and strife. Imagine you're some little Iraqi kid who lives near one of the bases Iran hit and had to wonder while the missiles were coming down if the next one was headed your way. We never factor in that all this violence has collateral effects on innocent people. 

&gt;We aren't at war with Iran

I'm not sure Iran sees it that way. And we are definitely at war in Afghanistan. Which is what I was thinking of. 

&gt;If you can criticize, then you must know a better way, or you shouldn't be criticizing.

Wrong. That doesn't follow logically. Imagine you are back in the world before round wheels. Some guy puts square wheels on a cart and drags it around going bump bump bump. Without having the idea for round wheels yet, you can look at that cart and say ""that's not working very well"". 

&gt;The tax law says you got a tax break. It's really hard for me to believe you didn't get a tax cut when it was across the board. 

I try to forget about it because if there is anything I hate thinking about it's income taxes, but from what I remember, in my situation, the tax cut most people received was offset by other changes. So for me and others like me, it was a wash. 

&gt;When I called you on it you told me I didn't understand income tax.

What was I supposed to do? Blow you a kiss?

&gt;You mean those who own the business or invest in the business. Not all of those people are rich. I own stock, I'm far from rich. 

Still, most business income is controlled by and benefits rich people. Cut a corporation's taxes, and what does management do? Stock buybacks and bonuses to themselves. Both of which put money in the pockets of people who already have lots of it. Often more than they know what to do with. 

&gt;Again we are at record low unemployment. That means businesses are hiring. That's a good thing.

The number of jobs isn't all that matters. So does the quality of them. And the sad truth is that most of the new jobs suck. Something like 44% of Americans are working in jobs that pay less than $18K. The middle class is vanishing and we're not going to regrow it on jobs like those. 

&gt;Outside of depressed New Mexico, no I do not.

Then you need to read more. Because that stuff is happening all over the country. These are not good times. 

You know what's keeping people stuck in places with no jobs? The cost of housing in places that have jobs. 

Silicon Valley has tons of jobs, and not just in tech. But who can afford to live there? Even tech workers are discovering they can't. 

Did you know our birth rate is the lowest it's been since the Great Depression? Young couples who want to have children are deciding against it because they aren't making enough money to cover their student loans and housing costs, letting alone having another mouth to feed. And before you say it, no, that's not just in New Mexico. 

&gt;Do you understand how percentages work?

I work with percentages all the time. Damn straight I know how they work. 

Well-paying jobs have seen larger percentage increases in their wages. So if you're already making a good living, chances are your living got noticeably better. But if you're making a lousy living, chances are good any percentage wage increase you received was small and wiped out by rising costs. 

&gt;No. Look outside of New Mexico. You can't blame New Mexican issues on Trump.

These are national economic issues. They are not limited to New Mexico. I'm dumbfounded that you think they are. 

Please, and I mean that sincerely, please read more. There is ton of economic information available online. 

&gt; Between Tariffs and tax cuts, he is making it more attractive to be an american company.

Tax cuts do not prevent or even discourage American companies from sending jobs to China. Which is what you seem to have implied before. 

&gt;That seems awfully contradictory. 

I think it is much more decent to tell someone to go fuck themselves than it is to claim you know their life better than they do.

501,501,responsible4self,"&gt; My preferred solution would be say to Iraq ""sorry for the mess"" and get the hell out of there

I would tend to agree with that. It sounds like they would like that too. But yes, listen to what Iraq wants because they have taken too much. 

&gt;Wrong. That doesn't follow logically. Imagine you are back in the world before round wheels. 

I disagree. if you understand the problem, you can do nothing or try and change. Doing noting means the problem remains, doping something is trying to fix the problem, even if you don't get it right.  Criticizing without  providing suggestions is like doing nothing. Because at that point you aren't trying, you leaving the problem be. Maybe your perspective is that we should just take the pot shots that Iran throws at us. I vehemently disagree with that. 

&gt;the tax cut most people received was offset by other changes. So for me and others like me, it was a wash.

But I acknowledged that loopholes were closed. Maybe your mad because it cost you money, and IDGAF. Most loopholes are for the benefit of wealthy. It seems inconsistent to say Trump helped the wealthy, but closed the loopholes.  Those itemized deductions are worth less, but the standard deduction went up. If you look at tax policy, more low income use standard deduction, and most wealthy itemize. I don't see that as hurting the poor. Sorry it impacted you, but that makes me think you aren't poor. You may not be rich, so welcome to the middle where everyone here gets dumped on. 

&gt;What was I supposed to do? Blow you a kiss?

No but insulting me when I do understand and just didn't agree with you isn't exactly mature and a way to have a conversation. 

&gt;Cut a corporation's taxes, and what does management do? 

What does management do when you raise their taxes? Raise the cost of goods, cut hiring, layoffs.  I'm pretty certain that the US had one of the highest corporate tax rates. We need lower rates and no loopholes. I don't recall the details of Trumps corporate tax policy, but I thought that was it, lower rates, fewer loopholes. I might be wrong here, this is what I remember.

&gt;The number of jobs isn't all that matters. 
It's pretty important though. If employers can easily find workers, they pay them less. If they have to fight for workers, they pay them more.  That's why this number matters.  
You also have to realize Trump doesn't hire, and he can't change things overnight. The trend is currently positive. Do you have data to show this is coming to an end? 

&gt;Then you need to read more. Because that's happening all over the country.

At least half the country is seeing descent growth. New Mexico is not. No, not everyone is doing great, but they are doing better than the picture you are painting. New Mexico is in the bottom 5 states that are not doing well. I bet if we were one of the states doing well, you would feel a lot different about the economy. 

&gt;The cost of housing in places that have jobs.
And how does this relate to Trump's policies? Or are we just complaining about shit at this point?

&gt;Well-paying jobs have seen larger percentage increases in their wages.

Yes and no. Often times in places that I worked, it was ""fair"" to offer 2% (or whatever) across the board. That certainly helped my manager more than me. And a tax cut at 1% across the board benefits the wealthy more than me too. Again you are sidetracking the conversation. Trump has nothing to do with raises. The wealthy got a bigger dollar amount in tax breaks than the poor, but that's because they pay a lot more. 

&gt;Please, and I mean that sincerely, please read more. There is ton of economic information available online.

Yes please, and it shows lots of states with lots of growth. AZ, Co, and TX have significantly more growth than NM. Did Trump single us out of growth because he thinks were Mexico?  Feel free to correct me, I'm a big boy I can be wrong. Show me where this stagnation is. 

&gt;Tax cuts do not prevent or even discourage American companies from sending jobs to China.

combined with Tariffs? That was my assertion. Companies don't have loyalty to China, it the cost of business. If the cost of business is less in the US, they will be in the US. 

&gt;I think it is much more decent to tell someone to go fuck themselves than it is to claim you know their life better than they do.

And I didn't say that, it's what you read into it. All I said was you got a tax cut. That is it. And you got one. 

&gt;Not triggered. Just not taking any shit.

Nope, it's more than that. I've generally been pretty respectful to you, and you have not returned the courtesy.

605,605,FormerlyTusconian,"&gt; Maybe your perspective is that we should just take the pot shots that Iran throws at us. 
I have no idea what all the options are in how we could have responded. I'm just a common citizen with only the information I can glean from public sources. Without access to all the military and diplomatic resources available to our president. So how am I supposed to know what that best option would be?
But as a citizen, I have every right to speak up when our president does something that strikes me as reckless and dangerous. 
It's called the first amendment.
&gt;I don't see that as hurting the poor. Sorry it impacted you, but that makes me think you aren't poor. You may not be rich, so welcome to the middle where everyone here gets dumped on.
Did I say it hurt the poor?
Yes, I am very much in the middle. 
&gt;No but insulting me when I do understand and just didn't agree with you isn't exactly mature and a way to have a conversation.
From my perspective, you were being impossible and insufferable and disrespectful. 
Which also isn't exactly mature and a way to have a conversation. 
&gt;What does management do when you raise their taxes? Raise the cost of goods, cut hiring, layoffs. 
But we're not talking about raising business income taxes. 
We're talking abut cutting them. So you have changed the subject. 
But on that subject, here's a question right back at you--
What should they do first, before all the things you listed, right now when they are so grotesquely overpaid? 
(In case you are unaware, management pay has skyrocketed to absurd levels.)
What they should do first is slash their own compensation and bring it back into line with what is reasonable. 
Think we'll see that happen?
&gt;I'm pretty certain that the US had one of the highest corporate tax rates. We need lower rates and no loopholes. I don't recall the details of Trumps corporate tax policy, but I thought that was it, lower rates, fewer loopholes. I might be wrong here, this is what I remember.
From what I've read, all those loopholes make it so that we actually have low corporate tax rates. 
Otherwise we wouldn't have so many corporations not paying any taxes, or even being subsidized. 
&gt;We need lower rates and no loopholes. I don't recall the details of Trumps corporate tax policy, but I thought that was it, lower rates, fewer loopholes. I might be wrong here, this is what I remember.
That's what he said he would do. From what I've read, he didn't do it. 
Again, if he had, we wouldn't have so many corporations not paying any taxes, or even being subsidized. 
&gt;It's pretty important though. If employers can easily find workers, they pay them less. If they have to fight for workers, they pay them more. That's why this number matters.
You may be surprised to learn that I was an economics major in college. And graduated with honors. 
I understand how supply and demand works. I used to tutor it. 
&gt;You also have to realize Trump doesn't hire, and he can't change things overnight. 
So government jobs aren't real jobs? Because as the president, he certainly affects government hiring.
He just entered his fourth year as president. That's not overnight. 
&gt;The trend is currently positive. Do you have data to show this is coming to an end?
Do you have any data, other than low unemployment, to show that things are getting better for most people? 
&gt;No, not everyone is doing great, but they are doing better than the picture you are painting. 
No, they really aren't. Especially young people. 
&gt;At least half the country is seeing descent growth. 
And is everyone benefiting? 
Or are the benefits going to the people who are already doing well, while everyone else lags behind?
Because that's the economy we've had for decades now: the rich keep getting much much richer, and the rest of us keep getting screwed. 
Growth only measures our economic output. Now how much benefit is going to whom.
In our economy, despite accompanying growth in productivity, the share of the benefit going to the rich keeps getting bigger.
By definition, that means the share of the benefit going to the rest of us keeps getting smaller. 
Wealth is becoming more and more concentrated.
Which gives the wealthy more and more economic, and therefore political, power. 
Which makes it easier and easier for them to extract more and more wealth. 
&gt;I bet if we were one of the states doing well, you would feel a lot different about the economy.
You could not be more wrong. 
And that is a condescending comment. 
&gt;And how does this relate to Trump's policies? Or are we just complaining about shit at this point?
I was illustrating how this economy is not working for most of us.
Which you apparently refuse to see, or at least to acknowledge. 
&gt;Yes and no. Often times in places that I worked, it was ""fair"" to offer 2% (or whatever) across the board. That certainly helped my manager more than me. 
But that is not what has happened. Higher paid workers have seen larger percentage increases in their wages.
We're not talking about where you have worked. We're talking about the whole economy. 
&gt;Again you are sidetracking the conversation. 
Again you are misinformed about the state of economy, and therefore happier than you should be with how things are going. 
&gt;The wealthy got a bigger dollar amount in tax breaks than the poor, but that's because they pay a lot more.
Are you aware of how little the wealthy actually pay in taxes, compared to the rest of us?
We pay a higher percentage of our income than they do. 
Even Warren Buffet has said so. 
&gt;Feel free to correct me, I'm a big boy I can be wrong. Show me where this stagnation is.
I'm not going to do your homework for you. Especially since, from my perspective, you refuse to see what is right in front of you. 
I never said stagnation. You are apparently fixated on economic growth. Which is a common mistake, and a common deflection. 
We have an economy in which growth is not benefiting everyone. 
The rich keep becoming fantastically richer. While everyone else struggles to hold their place. 
I'm not saying Trump made that happen. It's been going on since 1980 or thereabouts. But under Trump it keeps rolling along. Just like it did under Obama. 
Remember when Bill Gates said he was going to start giving his fortune away?
Well apparently he can't give it away fast enough. Because he's gotten much richer since then. 
&gt;combined with Tariffs? That was my assertion. Companies don't have loyalty to China, it the cost of business. If the cost of business is less in the US, they will be in the US.
Companies don't have loyalty to the US either. Tax rates only affect where the company puts its supposed headquarters. Not its jobs. 
&gt;And I didn't say that, it's what you read into it. All I said was you got a tax cut. That is it. And you got one.
And there you go, still calling me a liar. On a technicality. 
My taxes didn't go down. To me, that means I didn't get a tax cut. 
And despite what you may think, I'm not alone.
And on this one point, you are being a real dick. 
&gt;I've generally been pretty respectful to you, and you have not returned the courtesy.
With all due respect, calling me a liar, and insisting you know what happened to me better than I do, is the opposite of respectful.

The fire in my pasture started on another property and rushed through mine in less than half an hour. 

I don't irrigate my pasture because of the water scarcity. I just let the snow do it's business and hope for the best. I couldn't possibly afford to dig more wells and go through an irrigation process. I don't know anyone in my community that does any irrigation because our water is that tight.

641,641,interloperdog19,"I love Alamogordo (which is apparently a very unpopular opinion) but honestly as a short trip staying more in Cloudcroft is probably better. Alamo is kind of cursed/blessed by the huge military presence, which includes a lot of people from other areas staying there temporarily, which does make it a bit more generic than some others similarly sized NM towns. A lot of people also just work at WSMR in particular temporarily, so mid-range chain hotels and bland chain restaurants dominate certain areas.

For lodging I'd definitely opt for Cloudcroft if you want a unique experience. Dining is a bit more variable. At least when I lived there, NM cuisine was kind of lacking in CC and better in Alamo. Margo's and Rizo's were my favorites, though some others weren't bad. And there's this panaderia on I want to say 10th Street?  It's the main street leading up to the library on Oregon. Anyway it's a little place but absolutely delicious. For non-NM cuisine, JAM Hotdogs (or something like that, it's on one of the numbered side streets right across from the zoo) is also delightful. BZ Burgers is good, too.

There are also a few smaller local hotels on White Sands (edit: the road, not the park; White Sands Boulevard is the name of the main road through Alamogordo), but while I appreciate their vintage neon signs, I never stayed in a hotel there and my fiance only was put up by the government in one of the chain hotels, so I couldn't speak to their quality. And any local hotels off White Sands you probably want to stay away from.

In Cloudcroft, most places are going to be pretty good as it's very much a tourist town. I particularly recommend Dave's, though. We used to go there a lot and it's a fun place with great food and a lot of character, and Dave himself is there pretty frequently and loves to chat which IMO adds a certain element.",1578950379,feamry8

The Pueblo Revolt of 1680—also known as Popé's Rebellion—was an uprising of most of the indigenous Pueblo people against the Spanish colonizers in the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, present day New Mexico. The Pueblo Revolt killed 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 settlers out of the province. The Spaniards reconquered New Mexico twelve years later.

True, but this angle gets played sometimes that if we just weren't so nice then homeless people wouldn't exist.

Many products are being sold illegally because of the arbitrary .3% max law.

889,889,awakebustillinbed,"Any policy aimed at preventing mentally ill people from owning guns that goes further than the already on the books laws about mandatory reporting and people that have had involuntary holds placed on them being disallowed from gun ownership, is just going to prevent mentally ill people from seeking care.  Many people are already acutely aware of how much leeway there is for the therapist to interpret the mandatory reporting stuff especially wrt suicidality , that they are not keen on seeking therapy even with the current laws.  

Realistically, the majority of gun deaths are not from mass shootings.   They are from suicides and single homicides.   Mass shootings are a very emotionally charged topic but a) it's not evidence based to focus on preventing them if we want to prevent the largest number of deaths and b) focusing on flagging people with mental illness is probably not evidence based and is almost certainly discriminatory towards disabled people.    


That brings us to suicide.   I understand suicide prevention as a public health issue but I honestly believe that it's a personal choice that shouldn't be criminalized.   We should have more robust mental and physical (remember some suicides are due to people with chronic and terminal illnesses that are non psychiatric) health care to prevent suicide, but any laws that make someone  more likely to become involuntarily hospitalized or lose their guns for talking about suicide with friends family or a therapist, are only going to prevent more people from seeking help.  

Also I think if we dont have legal physician assisted suicide here, as in Switzerland, it's only humane to let people own firearms,  as it's one of the most quick and effective methods of suicide, and spares people a lot of the suffering that trying to overdose on various medications, or cutting,  would cause.  I realize this might be a really controversial opinion but I have an incurable chronic illness and I want to know there's an exit route if I need it. And I cant afford to fly to Switzerland to do that. 

Final thought, I'm totally for preventing people with domestic violence convictions from owning firearms.   Ironically a lot of the Bill's ppl tried to pass on this were stopped in their tracks by police unions because guess what--cops are disproportionately abusing their spouses.  I do think there should be some way to appeal and overturn a previous domestic violence conviction if possibly falsely accused though , but I think that should be a stringent process.  Generally believe in rehabilitative rather than punitive models of criminal justice.",1579392914,fev43hp
890,890,awakebustillinbed,"There's a common misconception that it would be efficient to curb gun violence by preventing mentally ill people from owning guns, since most mass shooters have been mentally ill.  

They are a tiny portion of mentally ill  people and most mentally ill people arent harmful to anyone but themselves.  

It seems like they are generally people with some form of antisocial personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder.  Not that we should profile everyone with those specific types of mental illness but it would be pretty shitty to red flag people for taking prozac or being schizophrenic if those disorders arent great predictors of committing a mass shooting. 

Domestic violence convictions might be a better predictor of gun violence than simply being mentally ill.",1579393221,fev56rz

The road conditons to both Chaco and Ah-shi-sle-pah can be impassable after any precipitation and break your car washboard rough during any other time. Bisti's trailhead is a short 10 min drive from Hwy 371 and you can get into very impressive hoodoo filled moonscapes in under a mile's walk.

Ah-shi-sle-pah offers the most solitude and has a gentle moonscape compared to Bisti's rugged jumble of hoodoos and mudhill slot canyons. The most impressive area of Ah-shi-sle-pah is around 10 miles round trip from the trailhead, so its some place that could take all day to explore.

Chaco is the only good place to camp and other places to spend the night will be a good ways away. If you prefer impressive ruins set in a Utah-like canyon, I would recomnend Chaco. If you would rather wander aimlessly amongst moonscapes and ponder unique geological formations then Bisti is the place for you.

I think children should be taught at a young age on how to operate and take care of a firearm. I also have no problem having a background check every single time I buy a gun. I would actually prefer that guns get registered to ANY buyer. Whether you got from a gun shop or a gun show. Treat it like a car, I sell you car, car gets registered in your name.

I swear every week or so some political figure wants to add extreme measures to prevent people from legally possessing a firearm. I saw on YouTube that some guy had to have a license/birth certificate/ vehicle registration just to buy some birdshot shells. Ridiculous. The only requirement in my state to buy ammo is 16 for rifle/shotgun and 21 for handguns. I'd required for proof of age just like Alcohol and Tobacco. Speaking of the ATF.... Where are these guys? They should be the ones dictating the vape scene and guns, not the NRA or some scared politicians.

Granted here in NM, the day you turn 18, you can buy a big ol' .50 Cal and strap it on your back and walk down main street. Yea sure, cops might hassle you but fuck you, it's my right. So you can buy a gun that could potentially shoot through a tank at 18. It's kinda neat.",1579431929,fexjcfz

Drive up through the organ mountains and go to Carlsbad first, drive up through Roswell to White Sands and then get to ABQ. Go to Santa Fe and end it in Taos. You can leave NM by driving through the panhandle and back to East Texas. I wouldn’t do the northern part first, I would leave that for part two of the trip.

As far as the Northern New Mexico end— go to Book Mountain in Santa Fe. It’s the best damn bookshop in the city, it’s a total hidden gem and so worth it. It doesn’t look like a lot from the outside but it’s an absolute treasure.

Go to Cafe Istanbul in ABQ. It’s a quirky little Mediterranean/Turkish Restaurant and grocery store that serves the best lunch I have ever eaten.

Go to Teresa’s Casa de Tamales in Cleveland, New Mexico (in Mora county). It’s amazing.

I agree about switching it up. New Mexican food is delicious but you don’t want to end up eating the same thing for every single meal.

Also definitely go to Greg Moon gallery in Taos. It’s a very cool place that features some really great low-brow art. It’s my favorite gallery in all of northern New Mexico.

Additionally The Love Apple in Taos serves amazing seasonal food. The menu is always changing and it is so worth it to eat there.

I am sure you already know about Meow Wolf so there is no need to tell you to go there. It is worth the ticket price.

Oh! George R R Martin opened a bookstore in Santa Fe called “Beastly Books” and it’s pretty cool. It is an expensive bookstore compared to Book Mountain, big worth checking out.

On your way out of Texas if you can stop for lunch in Wimberley (my favorite small town in all of Texas) check out Ino’z. Since you’re going through TX a lot of your vacay will definitely go through there, too. 

There is a trout hatchery in Mora that is pretty cool. The guy who runs it is named Tom and he loves Texans and he’ll give you a tour. It’s worth doing because it’s such a strange thing to see.

Oliver Lee Campground was wonderful for camping near White Sands. A reservation is also recommend for this. We tent camped, but lots of RVs is the only downside. Nice shower facilities and about $8 a night IIRC. 

My boyfriend and I had a great time staying at Hotel Luna Mystica in June up in Taos. It’s a “campground” of vintage campers. He’s 6’4 and comfortably fit in the one we stayed in. It’s up on the mesa a little north of Taos and I would imagine has pretty decent star gazing.

* Depending on the age range of our group we'll either eat lunch in town or go to the Pecos River Beach Park and Riverwalk to let the kids swim &amp; have a picnic. 
* Then we head out toward Whites City &amp; the Caverns.

It's also right next to the valles caldera, the center of a massive dormant supervolcano thats now filled with grassy Meadows interspersed with great fishing streams, surrounded on all sides by forested mountains and rich in herds of elk. On the same mountain is the kasha katuwe tent rocks national monument. An absolutely gorgeous hike up a mountain and through a slot canyon just like you'd expect to find in Utah or Arizona.

Just 30 minutes or so up 1-25 from santa Fe is the Pecos national monument which are the remains of the Pecos pueblo that wasn't vacated until the 1800's. Huge Adobe foundations and the ruins of a huge Adobe church are backdropped by the gorgeous sangre de Cristo mountains and the Pecos wilderness. If you're a more adventurous hiker there's trails up to the tops of the mountains with gorgeous Alpine lakes and panoramic views of the surrounding forested slopes and mountain peaks. 

Pecos national monument is also the site of the battle of glorieta pass, the most significant civil war battle west of the Mississippi River. It was there that the Confederates were halted from moving further west and capturing California. 

Just an hour further up I-25 from there is the town of Las Vegas, which is older than it's counterpart in Nevada, and contains many historic buildings. The city is located at the Eastern foot of the Sangre de Cristo mountains where it meets the great plains. It is here that Americans traveling along the Santa Fe trail became first introduced to the Spanish Vaquero culture and the cowboy was born. The railroad came through here in the mid 1800's and Las Vegas grew to be one of the largest cities between the west coast and the Mississippi. Victorian style homes flank extravagant Harvey houses built to take in travelers going west. These huge old hotels are now said to be very haunted and we're once the locale of legends of the West such as Jesse James, Billy the kid, the Dodge City Gang, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday, Vicente Silva, and countless others. Perhaps the coolest place in the city is Montezuma castle which is nestled in the foothills of the sangres and looks like a picturesque European castle nestled in tall pines and surrounded by a small rushing river flanked with natural hot springs that attracted famous people to stay there such as Presidents Grant, Hayes, and Theodore roosevelt , General Sherman, and emperor hirohito I of japan. It's now the United State's branch of the United world college system and it's dedication was attended in person by Prince Phillip in the 80's.

&gt;Climate conditions in Carlsbad Cavern are an exception to the average cave. With a large entrance and many miles of passages that drop over 1,000 feet (305 m), climate conditions in the cave are very complex and only remain fairly stable long distances from the entrance. The main portion of the cave is a cold trap. In winter, once the temperature outside has dropped below the temperature in the cave, cold, usually dry, air plunges into the lower part of the entrance. This cold dry air flows down the large Main Corridor and into the Big Room and Lower Cave. As this cold dry air pushes into the cave along the floor, warmer moist air is displaced, forced up to the ceiling and pushed out of the upper part of the entrance. Over a long period of time, this natural process has cooled the Big Room to an average of 56°F (13ºC), which is 12°F (-11ºC) cooler than the ends of the cave and other large cave systems in the area.

All Texas did was try to assume the land they took from the Mexicans. Texas was unable to, that’s it. Who is worse Spain, Mexico, or Texas? If the answer is Texas your opinion is false given the discrimination, hatred, and hardship imposed on the people from Spain and Mexico. 

Also, El Paso was and is more a part of NM than Texas.  No people in NM alive today experienced anything associated with the Texas expedition into the NM territory in the what 1840s and if you think Texas is worse than Spain and Mexico you have problems with facts. 

People in NM should lose the bigotry.",1580037158,fflalwz
1152,1152,Previous-Disaster,"Sigh do I really have to do this?

Fine. The Americans promised to obey the laws if they become Mexican citizens. Then a bunch illegally immigrated to Texas. They did it without the governments permission. They did it in the name of manifest destiny.

What was the one law the Texans couldn't agree to? Come on I know you know it since you know sooooo much more about history than me. Ding Ding bells up.

Guerro outlawed slavery and the Texans lost their minds. They wanted the land anyways been when the government of Mexico told them they couldn't have slaves they used it as a excuse to over throw the government. Such noble men.

Texas sent a expedition to steal land from New Mexico soon after but all they were doing was being noble. 

Ask a black person who was worse then? Mexico which gave them their freedom or the slave owners?

See that's just it you guys can never see your own faults.

You know how many innocent Mexicans were killed by the Texas rangers? or how much land was straight up yanked? 

See all day I can go after my ancestors for what they did to the Natives but your's have to be perfect.

What else did I say. If a Texan isn't racist I love them. If they are like the one I might who said Hitler was right than I ain't gonna like them.

I lived there for a couple of years and while I had a great group of friends up there, I ended up moving to Albuquerque anyway for a better job and more advancement opportunities.  

The major drawbacks in ABQ are the high property (nonviolent) crime and other things that stem from being a relatively poor city in a poor state, like drug addiction and homelessness (although that’s due in part to the climate - you can live outside most of the year here and not die from exposure). There’s allegedly a lack of educated young professionals - we suffer from major brain drain to higher-paying locales such as Austin, Denver, Phoenix, etc. - but there are still plenty around.

The Mexican Government are the ones to traffic children in Mexico. If it weren't for the Cartel trying to rebuild Mexico and keep the children safe, then Mexico would be just as bad or worse than most third world countries like Nigeria or the Philippines. Men in office usually think they can get away with it. That's why in most countries, they marry children and do what they want with them just because of marriage. Just like Mohammad. But of course there are other countries like Nigeria where the age of consent is 11?! Philippines and Brazil have ridiculous ages of consent. Then that's where the trafficking begins in the first place. A person under 18 could never be able to fend for themselves or make a rational decision at 11 or younger with ""marriage"". As long as they think it's okay to marry a damn kid and be able to have sexual relationships just because of a marriage, then the sex trafficking will continue. It's just disgusting. And if you think a wall will stop corruption your wrong. People guarding the border are definitely corrupt. They know who's going through that border with contraband.

1195,1195,masamunecyrus,"OP, non-native implant, here.

Two things to note about comments you're going to see in /r/NewMexico and /r/Albuquerque

1. Crime rate is exaggerated by New Mexicans. You're welcome to look up the stats yourself (""crime rate per capita"" is not difficult to Google). Factually, ABQ is by no means a ""safe"" city. The one statistic we are truly notable at is vehicle thefts, which we're #1 by a wide margin. However, outside of car thefts, you're likely to find crime similar to most medium-sized cities in the Rust Belt or the South.

2. Saying that New Mexico drivers are among the worst in the country is exasperatingly ignorant. I've been all over the country, and I wouldn't even put New Mexico drivers in the top 10 worst. I commute daily in Albuquerque, and I see turn signals well over 50% of the time cars change lanes. Driving around curves, people tend to stay in their lanes. If you're passing both both metrics, no way are you even close to ""horrible drivers."" Perhaps owing to the weather, the road conditions are very decent, too. If people want to see bad drivers, they should try Memphis, Boston, or Washington D.C., for starters.

In my experience, New Mexicans' opinion about New Mexico is driven by rose-tinted glasses about everywhere that's not New Mexico and shit-tinted glasses about everything in New Mexico. I get the vibe that people travel to other cities and think they're phenomenal, because, well... usually when traveling, one tends to stay in the nice parts of the city that are rich and with things to do. Albuquerque is also hardly the only city I've lived in that is particularly myopic on its bad and ignorant of its own good, but it is definitely more forceful in its opinion in that way. It'd take a thesis to describe all the things to do and places to go within an hour of the city that when you bring up in conversation, people go, ""*where's that*"" or *what's that?*""

If you want my subjective opinion, Albuquerque is a pretty average city in many respects. We're small enough and poor enough that shopping isn't very remarkable. There's very little upper class, and it's largely a lower and middle class city. It's also largely Hispanic. Think living in an average neighborhood in Los Angeles--all the good and bad that entails.

What separates New Mexico from other places is its emptiness and its people. If you choose to go into the wilderness, you may not see another human all day. If you want to camp, there's no shortage of places to do it and chances are it's free. And we're an absolutely eclectic mix of strange, weird, and independent people. I think that because of that, moreso than any other place I've ever been *in the world*, New Mexicans are open and accepting of unusual hobbies and people.

A collection of thoughts:

* Santa Fe is the second largest art market in the US--after NYC.

* The Santa Fe Opera is world-renowned.

* I don't know if there are stats on it, but I'd be surprised if we didn't have one of the highest per-capita authors, artists, and artisans in the country.

* We've got art communities, like Madrid, and even little former cow towns like Magdalena--population a few hundred--have a few art galleries.

* We have [A LOT](https://www.abqtheatre.com/meet-atg) of independent theater groups

* Our biggest industries are two nuclear weapons laboratories, Hollywood, and all the industry and contractors that go along with those two things

* We have a [brewery](https://bombsawaybeer.com) decorated with bombs, and if you're driving down the road and see a [huge missile](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/National_Museum_of_Nuclear_Science_%26_History_Redstone_Rocket.tif/lossy-page1-683px-National_Museum_of_Nuclear_Science_%26_History_Redstone_Rocket.tif.jpg), that's just the [National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Nuclear_Science_%26_History). You never know when you'll see a missile. I last saw a random 10 ft tall missile in the garden of a pizza shop in Taos. We're an odd state.

* We are rapidly becoming Hollywood's favorite alternative location outside California. Starting this year, we are home to Netflix's first movie studios, a $1 billion investment.

* Facebook is spending $6 billion, or so, on a massive data center in Los Lunas, which I'm optimistic will attract other tech due to the massive infrastructure investments involved.

* I can't stress enough how weird this state is. Good and bad, we've got it all, as long as it's *weird.*

* Home of the National Institute of Flamenco 

* We've got an amateur astronomy club with its own [observatory-class telescope](http://taas.org/GNTO/). I mean, why not? Between [NRAO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radio_Astronomy_Observatory), [MRO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Ridge_Observatory), [Spaceport America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceport_America), [White Sands Missile Range](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range), [Kirtland Air Force Base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base), [Sandia National Laboratories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories), some of the [best](https://www.darksky.org/new-mexico-blazing-a-dark-sky-trail/) [recognized](https://www.darksky.org/our-work/conservation/idsp/sanctuaries/cosmiccampground/) dark skies in the world, and *long and storied history* of UFO and alien stories and myths, I wager we have more than a few optical engineers, astronomers, and amateur space enthusiasts.

* Socorro has an amateur experimental aircraft club. Quite a few people fly in hand-built planes and other flying contraptions

* [United Nuclear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar) used to operate out of a site in the mountains east of ABQ.

* [Tinkertown](http://tinkertown.com)

* Bad weird stuff, too. Church of Scientology secret underground mountain base? [We got that](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trementina_Base) Lunatic [Aggressive Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_Christianity_Missionary_Training_Corps) cult? We got that, too. Jeffrey Epstein evil human trafficking sex ranch? [Had it](https://apnews.com/c874d9e5a4524baaa1f6329a39a1fc05). Compound the Vatican secretly sent exiled Catholic priests who molested children for decades? [Yep](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete).

In many ways, New Mexico remains the real *Wild West.* Perhaps as a result of that, I find people are surprisingly tolerant, here. Not because they're necessarily liberal and unprejudiced people, but because the *live and let live* sense is very strong. *Maybe I don't like you and you don't like me, but so long as we aren't getting in each others' business, who cares?* My first month in New Mexico, I was driving down I-25 listening to the radio, and they were playing some sort of Communist poetry going on about how the English language has been co-opted by corporate interests. Simultaneously, I drove past a giant sign that said ""OBAMA TREASON."" This is a state where those two ideologies coexist.

There is not a monocultural or thought bubble, here. Whether you're fascist, anarchist, communist, liberal, conservative, racist, a hippie, environmental activist, starchild, an oil field roughneck, or whatever, you will coexist here with people here you strongly disagree with and put you outside your comfort zone. But because there's such a mix of eclectic people and ideologies, this is a state where you can be a Middle Eastern immigrant broken down on the side of the road in the desert in a Prius with liberal bumper stickers, and someone in a lifted truck with a Confederate flag and a MAGA hat will stop to make sure you're ok. I happen to value these kinds of interactions.

If you require a more cultured urban city with the benefits of a large population and a lot of money, you will probably be turned off from Albuquerque by, what at times, can seem like a dusty underdeveloped town filled with people with the negative aspects of strong machismo. But if you're a more independent person, I think you'll find that there is simultaneously avant garde art, arthouse film, provocative theater, surprising diversity (ABQ has Turkish, Greek, Persian, Mexican, Thai, and Japanese festivals, among others), and excellent and interesting company if you put forth some effort to find it. In the end, ABQ is what you make of it. There are enough niches here to find your place, wherever that may be. It is a small city, so your niche will be small, but the people I have met here and the groups I've interacted with are unlike people anywhere else I've ever been. Not necessarily always good, but definitely not always bad.",1580088612,ffp854f

The reason you're being downvoted is because you're creating a strawman of an imagined gay person in your head, and then applying that imaginary persona to every gay person you meet.

In reality, somewhere between 2% and 5% of all human populations are gay. You have interacted with hundreds of gay people in your life, and you didn't even know it, because they *didn't* announce their sexuality to you, and they *didn't* have a victim complex.

Actually I consider 3 of them normal... 1 of them was a closeted homosexual (I'm not even sure if he's sure he's gay) but he did some weird shit and was burying his gayness with drugs. I did shrooms with the guy and I could definitely tell he was gay. 

I did slightly consider what you said as far as not knowing the normal gay people. But then I thought about the number of people I've more than likely interacted with. Also, the number is like 3.8% of the population is gay. That's the size of Rhode Island. But if you ask almost anyone what they think there percentage of gay people is... They typically say over 20%... which means they are being over represented in all aspects of life. 3% of the population should not be represented as predominately as they are. I even had a friend tell me 50% of the population was gay. After I re educated him he was shocked and was more willing to listen to me and what I have to say about the subject. 

I don't believe you are correct on your assumptions. My interactions with gay people have led me to my perspective. I even dated a chick that was bisexual. I learned a lot on how these people think. Its not normal. And a lot of it comes from sexual abuse/molestation as children. 

I don't agree with it. I don't hate on people, but I don't agree with it. I think all victims are pathetic... because each individual has the ability to overcome victimhood. I don't agree with celebrating someone's sexuality. Its ridiculous. That's how I feel.",1580091002,ffpbmfz

We like Santa Fe, seems big enough to be entertaining but small enough to not have traffic and other big city issues.  Locals say Santa Fe housing is expensive, but it’s not compared to either coast.    Like the weather here too.  We get snow, melts in 2 days.   Gets hot in July, cools off as soon as sun goes down thanks to the altitude.   The brag of 350 days of sun per year isn’t far off. Storms pass thru quickly leaving rainbows &amp; sunsets.  Just don’t get day after day of clouds.   
     
It’s not perfect.  Very catholic, effects the politics.  Education systems are mediocre at best.   The plenty of poverty resulting in property crime.  Things are far apart, big national acts go from Texas to AZ or Colorado, skipping NM.

1286,1286,Nocoffeesnob,"Don't underestimate how difficult it will be to get over:

1. The culture shock.  Things just move slower here and everyone is generally more casual, even compared to Portland.  This took me over a year to get used to it after moving here from Northern California, especially when it came to restaurant service. 
2. The sun.  I seriously found the sunny days to be oppressive at first, even though I had been initially looking forward to it.  Back in Oakland it was overcast nearly every morning and evening but sunny in the middle of the day - here it's sunny most days from the crack of dawn to sunset.  In the summer when the days get longer it can be a little intense, especially if you enjoy sleeping in on the weekends.  My wife and I had to invest in blackout shades to get through the first few years. Now, 15 years later, I am in love with the sunshine but at first it was a little rough.  Between the sunshine and the high altitude  wearing sunscreen for any outdoor activity that lasts more than 45 minutes is essential to avoid burns.
3. The brown.  A friend told me when I moved here that initially I'd miss the greenery of the West Coast but that I'd eventually get used to it and start to see shades of brown everywhere.  That proved true - at first the natural brown tones of the open desert (and indeed any empty patch of land) just looked ""brown"" to me but after a few years I got used to seeing it as beautifu and bountiful shades of brown.  When I go somewhere extra green (such as Georgia) it seems almost overwhelming to my eyes as I'm no longer used to it.

My family's been in New Mexico like two decades and this still drives my parents nuts sometimes, though both love the state otherwise. It definitely is a cultural difference, though.

Like, my clients will drop me if I don't respond to them within a business day? That's insane!

The arts scene is pretty big - loads of local theatre and music, fine art and newer experimental/non traditional exhibitions and galleries, and the University of New Mexico brings in off-Broadway shows in addition to putting on their own performances. Albuquerque is home to the India Pueblo Cultural Center, which commemorates our local indigenous population. We’re punching far above our weight in the craft beer scene. Santa Fe has the Georgia O’Keefe Museum, and is the oldest capital city in the US, with history dating back to the 1500s (via the Spaniards, the local Tewa tribes had settled in the area around 900 CE!). Lots and lots of cool history, some bloody and violent, some very beautiful.  

We get marked seasons, because we’re so high up elevation-wise. Much of the state is higher than Denver. There’s good skiing within a couple of hours of Albuquerque in the winter, great camping and fishing and summer activities, the Balloon Fiesta in the fall, and.... lmao idk if anything fun happens in the spring because it’s too fuckin windy and cold and my allergies are always killing me. 

All that said, we’re a poor city in a poor state, and our crime reflects that. 97% of the roads are unpaved here, an indicator that we’re highly rural.  Politics is an old boy’s club.

The people are mostly nice, but there’s a strange defensiveness to them, which I don’t understand. But they aren’t relaxed in where they are, who they are.

I have a place which is far from the cities. I live in a county which is about the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island with a population of about 17,000. Not Alaska sparce and large but I like it.

When I drive into the grocery which is nearest (40 miles) the road provides views of mountains that are about a hundred miles away (Sandia Crest and Mount Taylor).

Wildlife here makes me happy. Elk, mule deer, bobcats, gray foxes, coyotes, skunks, golden eagles, Chiuahuan ravens, peccaries, black bears, prairie rattlesnakes, horned toads, spadefoot toads, and scores of other interesting animals can be seen at my place through the year. I have found at least 150 different species of plants on my place. Summer monsoon rains bring about 10-12 inches of rain and then most of the wildflowers bloom.

The main industries in my neighborhood (lets say a 20 mile radius) are cattle, hunting, federal lands, cattle, retirement paychecks, cattle, university work, cattle, welfare checks, government funded science (Very Large Array), cattle, and cattle.

I live in a state where the landscape is more shaped by volcanic activity that any other than Hawaii. My spread is on top of a caldera which was active about twenty million years ago.

I live at about 7,000 feet altitude. The landscape is pinon/juniper woodland above short grass prairie. Five miles away to the east is an eleven thousand foot peak with Douglas fir, aspen, and ponderosa pine. The peak is snow covered now. Five miles to the south is Chihuahuan desert with about ten inches of rain a year.

About half of the people who live around here speak Spanish in the home. They get testy if you refer to them as Mexicans. Their families often came to this are in the 1600s.  About a tenth of the people speak Navajo. Their families came a few thousand years ago. Most of the rest are Anglos who mostly came in the late 1800s or early 1900s or last week.

The most notable site in this county may be Trinity Site where the first atom bomb was set off. People are allowed to visit it. The most notable sight may be Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge on the Rio Grande where tens off thousands of snow geese and sandhill cranes spend the winter.",1580387381,ffznto5

We even have an official state question, ""Red or Green?""  The question is what chile do you want on your meal. Green chile is for me. Roasted and peeled they may be gentle and sweet with an indescribably rich and unique flavor. I put them on everything. Red chile is the dried ripe pod ground and lightly seasoned. A rich red sauce on huevos rancheros makes millions of New Mexicans full of joy.  The two agricultural crops of greatest value in New Mexico are chiles and pecans. New Mexico State University has a whole institute just dedicated to chiles. They often have the honor of breeding the hottest chiles.

If you can't buy them, then rent them from the library.

Ultimately, travel is one of the most rewarding and memorable things a person can do. Experiencing the lives of other peoples in other cultures is often the biggest difference in how one perceives the world (even how you perceive places you haven't visited).

Focus on breathing, and naturally thoughts will come and simply let them go. Keep doing this and clear yourself from constant over-stimulus and over-thinking. Remove yourself from the news/media and nonsense of the anxious world and find *yourself* a little more. There really is nothing to worry about, put your trust in The Lord. Give Him your cares and He will give you peace.

If you're dead-set on worrying about something, it is much more productive to worry about getting hit by a car or getting cancer, as both of those things are much, much more likely to happen than the world economy collapsing (and, if it makes you feel any better, it already has, like twice in the last 100 years - 1929 and 2008 - and we're still here with our reality TV and fast food).  

Travel is getting cheaper all the time.  The world will still be there in two years, five years, and fifteen years.  Most of it will still be relatively safe to visit.  Regional unrest comes and goes.  

Just because you're not traveling now and have not yet traveled enough to your satisfaction does not mean that you won't be able to do so in the future.  Again, I have to reiterate the importance of the choice you've made to not saddle yourself with insurmountable debt early on in life.  I have so, so many friends who are chained to jobs they hate in cities they despise surrounded by people they abhor, slogging through lives they really really really don't enjoy and actively seek all kinds of chemical relief from, because they can't afford to seek greener pastures due to the amount of debt they've taken on in order to go to a fancy four-year.  

Do you really want that for yourself?  You've opted not to do that.  I don't think you know it, but you've chosen freedom for yourself later in life by not taking on $60,000 in debt with a high interest rate.  The more you save now (I'm using ""save"" loosely here - I don't mean having a cash savings account, I basically mean just not costing yourself more money by taking on loans) when you're younger basically translates to *more* money and therefore the choices and freedom that comes along with that economic advantage later in life.  

The art scene in Albuquerque isn't much different than the art scene in the rest of the state - it's heavy on the Southwestern and Pueblo influence, but that's to be expected.  Dig a little deeper and there's loads of content, ranging from Tinkertown's one-man folk-art extravaganza to shows and galleries dedicated to fine art, or glass-blowing, or shows that center specifically on various interpretations of Lady Godiva's wild ride.   It's like seeking out books that are written by people who aren't white men: slightly more challenging, but your perspective is all the richer for having experienced their work.

1560,1560,interloperdog19,"Yeah, fam, I've been past Akela Flats and gotta agree with u/sunparakeet and u/heyknauw. It's a pretty normal rural NM community, actually way less rural than a lot of others. I've also lived in several similar ""strange"" communities.

It's not that far from either Deming or Cruces, for one thing. A lot of people in these rural communities do commute. Like for kind of a similar one, I knew a guy who lived in a collection of about maybe 8-10 plots off Highway 60 who commuted about 45 minutes each way to work in Socorro. He just worked at a retail store, too. But when real estate is that cheap, you can pull it off. And long drives are pretty normal. Even in cities, it isn't terribly uncommon for people to commute from ABQ to Santa Fe or vice versa, which is over an hour.

In a lot of these areas, too, there is kind of a hidden ag industry. You'll see some people working on ranches and stuff that are nearby but aren't obvious from the highway.

You also see a lot of people living off of disability and things like that. A lot of these rural areas are super cheap so you get your SSDI or whatever and can maybe afford a place that costs $300/month. You can rent a shitty room in someone's house in town or you can live in a shitty trailer in the country. Lots of people choose the shitty trailer (I probably would myself).

1567,1567,OPsDearOldMother,"It's probable that both claims are true and different generations of New Mexicans tended to identify differently. Identity is such a tricky thing to make concrete statements on in part because it's so personal and has been basically confined in the US to what boxes you can tick on a census form. I believe in the 30's Mexican was the only thing that people of Latin American origin could choose to identify as on the census. Another identifier I've heard is that New Mexicans tended to identify as [Hispanos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanos_of_New_Mexico), decades before the term ""Hispanic"" was created for the purposes of the census.

I'd argue that New Mexican culture is distinct enough from any other Latin American one to warrant its own monicker, but at the same time it is important to recognize how close our ties are to Mexico. My girlfriend's grandma experienced a lot of racism growing up in northern nm in the 60's because she was darker than her brother and sister and so got called Mexican and Indian. That definitely got internalized and I believe she still looks down on ""Mexicans"" to some extent but since Trump came on the scene I think there's been a huge shift in solidarity between the old school ""Spanish"" here and newer arrivals from Latin America.",1580521869,fg59rfr

The draw deadline is rapidly approaching and it's hard to say if you'll know enough in time to get anywhere on big game. But turkey season is coming which might be a good move. It is a *fairly simple hunt, much cheaper than big game and can teach you a lot. Harvesting a turkey is challenging but rewarding. Small game abounds and the winter is better rabbit season. I wouldn't say no to small game this year if I was you.

If you get in with BHA or other group you'll probably meet someone who draws a tag that you can help on. Usually they'll throw some meat your way.

## From your own link:

 &gt;But Trump's signing of the bill was partially overshadowed by environmentalist groups angered that his proposed federal budget cuts funding by 31 percent for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. His proposed budget also reduces funding for the U.S. Department of the Interior by 14 percent and completely eliminates a $7,500 tax credit given to owners of electric vehicles. Additionally, the president named a former coal lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, as head of the EPA.

1676,1676,interloperdog19,"&gt;Pretty much like anything else, long as you stay away from that kind of energy and you don’t draw attention to yourself you should be good.

That's pretty much how it is in ABQ, for sure. The exception would largely be vehicle theft, that is a big problem and can hit anyone, but even that's kind of unlikely if you take some basic precautions. But I mean, I used to live in the part of town nicknamed the ""war zone"" and would walk home from work alone at like 11 PM and never had an issue. New Mexicans like to complain about crime but it really isn't that big of a deal unless you're involving yourself in it.

My biggest piece of advice in general is that especially when you first move there, drink tons of water and take it slow. Altitude sickness affects a lot of newcomers, as even the city itself is about a mile high. Your body also won't be used to the dry climate and it can cause you to get mildly dehydrated before your sense of thirst kicks in, and dehydration exacerbates the effects of altitude sickness. So especially since you're moving to train in MMA, plan your move so that you give yourself some time to acclimate and make sure you're drinking water throughout the day.",1580758511,fggbral

And no problem! Even once the initial altitude sickness issue is past, you might want to be prepared for some reduced performance at first if you haven't spent much time at high elevation. It's normal and will go away once you get used to the thinner air and all that fun stuff, but it can be frustrating at first. I don't know much about MMA but I used to coach a different sport in ABQ and saw that really frustrate some new residents.

Hope you enjoy it! I don't live there anymore as we had to move away for my partner's job, but I grew up in ABQ and love it. It's quirky, for sure, but that's part of the charm.",1580759822,fggdw6n

What I can say is that the wages in comparison to El Paso, TX (right next door) are better by far depending on the job. But this is probably due to the fact that the minimum wage is much lower in most other places.

Baylor's Confederate force at his base at Fort Fillmore on July 26, Federal Major Isaac Lynde decided to abandon the fort and retreat northeast to Fort Stanton through San Augustin Pass in the Organ Mountains. During the pursuit the following day, the Confederates captured hundreds of straggling Federals overcome by the July heat and lack of water. Lynde's dehydrated command, was reduced to 200-300 men by the time it was overtaken by the Confederates. Major Lynde asked for terms and Baylor demanded unconditional surrender, to which Lynde agreed and made his surrender at San Augustine Springs on July 27.""

Alan Dershowitz who himself wrote a oped about why it should be ok to sleep with minors. 

Why did he let Alex Acosta into his administration?  

No actual proof Trump had Epstein banned from anything but plenty of pictures of them hanging out. 

Trump said ""Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""

Trump has been accused of watching young girls at his Miss America pageant. Could be false but there is just as much proof of this as him kicking Epstein out of Mara-Lago.

Democrats were trying to destroy people's lives because of ""thought crimes"" (Covington Catholic School Kid), and they were also trying to police our speech (Forcing people to call transexuals by the wrong gender or made up genders).  So I love Trump that he's fighting against that stuff and fighting for our 1st amendment where we actually have freedom of speech. Glad you know Big Brother is an issue. Join the Trump train and fight back against the elite. Its hilarious that the most powerful people in the world also hate Trump. Unlike Obama, Biden, Hillary etc. At least everyone hates Bernie. lol. 

Assange did what he did because he hated the Clintons or what not. And I'm all for that. But if he did do illegal shit, its illegal. I'm pretty sure one of his charges was sexual assault on a woman? Not 100% but pretty sure I read that a while back. Julian Assange is clouded in mystery but I wouldn't be able to give him credit for getting Trump elected. He may have helped but he wasn't the primary source. 

I'm more libertarian. Less government control and more power to the people. I also live in a liberal state and it has gotten out of hand. So IMO there's an obvious lack of leadership or good ideas coming out of state government. They're pretty shitty to be honest. So I see Trump as anti establishment, he's the only president that has LOST money being president, he also doesn't get paid for his job, he says what he wants, he's Christian, and he thinks our country should have enforced borders. I agree with him much more than any other president I have lived thru. He just happens to be conservative, and he's not really conservative either. He just ran on that platform. Oh ya, Im also pro life. I don't believe in killing babies.

Everyone else in the van has to pay monthly to be in it, but the Federal government has a mass transportation subsidy that will pay for a person’s vanpool share so it actually turns out to be free.

Housing is more expensive here than most of the state but that all depends on what you’re used to.   There does seem to be an improving young scene with a number of breweries and other spots.  There is a small airport that the city is trying to grow so there might be some opportunities there.    Also SF is a nice size, enough to do but no traffic and little crime.  To us Albuquerque was too big &amp; las cruces was too hot, but you both need to come out and see, especially the weather, how hot is it in the summer.

1971,1971,ShyTraxex,"Hello fellow 25-year old! Las Cruces sounds like it has what you want. It’s a small city when compared to the rest of country. Clean air and water, beautiful mountains in the backdrop. With your background you can definitely find a job here. Either at the White Sand Missile Range or at one of the dozen of aerospace companies that have made southern NM their home. Our winters are very mild to what you are used to. Sometimes we get a cold front and temperature can drop to 30 degrees or lower at night. But then during the day it’s sunny and it’s a nice 50-60 degree weather. Our summer and fall seasons are warm but nothing like Arizona. It’s also awesome to have the Organ mountains-desert peaks national monument only a 15 minute drive from us. The nightlife here had gotten much better in recent years so you don’t feel like you have to go to El Paso for fun. The downtown area has been revitalized with a couple of breweries, bars and restaurants. But going to El Paso is also great once in a while. Can’t beat Alamo Drafthouse for going to see a movie. The food here is also diverse. You will find a million mom and pop Mexican restaurants. But we also have Pho, sushi, Indian and Chinese restaurants. Then you have the awesome, super successful New Mexican restaurants like The Shed, Bite of Belgium, Pecan Grill, Lorenzo’s (Italian) and a few others.",1581193652,fgzfbfr
1972,1972,interloperdog19,"Nah, it's not a bad commute at all. My partner was at Holloman, and we lived in Alamo but we drove into Cruces a few times a month just for date nights. It's a very easy drive. I've definitely had worse commutes in other areas I've lived.

The Alamo rental market is pretty weird. How many and what kind of pets do you have, if you don't mind me asking? If you don't want to answer that's obviously okay, but I have a bunch of dogs so learned the pet-friendly rentals pretty quick living down there.

Alamo gets a lot of hate but honestly, I don't think it's a bad town. We enjoyed living there. Cruces is better overall but for us the trade-off of two fewer hours spent on work-related stuff every day was worth the lack of amenities. And there is stuff to do in Alamo, it's just a bit limited and you have to look harder for it.

Either place is a pretty nice place to live.

edit: Also, at least when I lived there, Alamo did have a decent health food store (at least by small town standards) and a small farmers market (farmers market was summer only). There were also constantly people selling seasonal produce on the roadside, and their food is always super cheap and tasty.",1581194185,fgzhg1m

1975,1975,interloperdog19,"You should be able to find a rental in Alamogordo with those pets! We had a similarly sized GSD and three other dogs along with two cats.

The market in Alamo is weird because it's very realtor-controlled. Most of the nicer places are managed by realtors. If you are interested in renting in the town itself, I'd recommend actually contacting a realtor in each of the major firms. Most good rentals aren't listed online IME. Coldwell Banker was the big one when I was there, and I'm sorry, I'm blanking on some others but there aren't a huge number of them. We found that they were often pretty flexible about pets if you were otherwise a good candidate, even if the actual listing said no pets or placed a strict limit on the type/amount.

Also, not sure where you're looking, but most independent rentals listed online in Alamo are listed in Facebook Marketplace, which tripped me up a bit as it's not a big resource in other places I've lived. Independent rentals are tough to find from out-of-state though because most do just put out a sign and rely on word of mouth.

So it's doable for sure, but it may not be worth the effort if you guys like a bit more ""big city"" life (lol at calling Cruces ""big city,"" but hopefully you know what I mean).",1581196250,fgzozxy

1980,1980,thisismy9-11,"I lived in Albuquerque for two years and loved it more than anywhere I’ve lived and I highly recommend it for the reasons you state. But you should also consider ABQ even though it’s bigger than 100,000 it’s easy to get around. Santa Fe is pretty small but beaiftil. NM gets a bad rep for some reason. It’s not entirely deserved but ABQ sure has its share of crime but if you’re smart about stuff you’ll most likely be fine. Personally I liked the northern greener part of the state but the “desert” was much much more beautiful than I ever imagined. 

And the dry air is awesome. Living in south Florida now, I look back on days when it was in the upper 90s in ABQ and it was nowhere near as bad as upper 80s here with almost 100% humidity. 

NM is super underrated. It has a lot of the same stuff that CO has without the crowds

If you guys do wind up living there, I'd recommend finding ways to branch out from base life. Alamo does actually have a lot of diversity to it for such a small town, but there tends to be a big divide between military/military-adjacent folks and locals. I grew up in NM (Albuquerque, though) so it was probably easier for me, but I saw it a lot in my partner's colleagues.

It is hard to find things to do there, but you'll find openings if you just do things like become a regular at certain places and are open to chatting with people (the library in Alamo is awesome for this), and check out the bulletin boards at the grocery stores and library for classes and stuff you might be interested in. There are also a few local festivals that are fun, and the church fiestas (there's one in Alamo proper and one in La Luz, which is a small town just to the north; might be some others but those are the ones I've been to) held in the fall are awesome for meeting people. You don't have to be Catholic to attend them, it's a big community thing in small town New Mexico.

edit: and just to clarify, I'm an atheist and still enjoy the church fiestas there, so I'm not trying to low-key proselytize here. They generally have published schedules and there are some religious activities but most of the event is just live music, food, games, etc.",1581199937,fh02sjr

As for internet, the local DSL option is through [https://www.wnmc.com/](https://www.wnmc.com/) and they offer speeds up to 25mbps, but it's not cheap compared to other more urban areas....  Availability of the DSL option just depends how far north of Quemado you'll be living.

I work remotely and have both WNMC and HughesNet Gen5. We're comfortable with the limitations of satellite internet and it fits our needs, even when we run out of our data allocation and speeds drop to around 5mbps, we can still stream Netflix and I can work uninterrupted. Other services like Hulu and Prime require the full speed to be available, which is 25mbps.

Pros for this area is that you can be as involved with the community or not involved to any level you want. We love the space and freedom of raising our family here and everything this area has to offer.

It allows law enforcement officers to petition the state attorney to remove property from someone. This does not call the person to the stand, does not call for witnesses, or any testimony.

""Procedural due process requires government officials to follow fair procedures before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property.[25]:657 When the government seeks to deprive a person of one of those interests, procedural due process requires the government to afford the person, at minimum, notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a decision made by a neutral decisionmaker.

2152,2152,StructuralGeek,"Without some manner of emergency in play, which is assumed due to the fact that the police aren't breaking in the door rather than going through procedural steps, due process is required.  Part of due process is notice of intent submitted to the gun owner and the ability of the gun owner to argue against the action in a neutral court.  An administrative, single party, filing does not satisfy this requirement.

I would argue that, rather than ultimately imprison someone if someone else believes them to be a threat to themselves or others, the better option would be to build a more effective and welcoming mental health system that doesn't mean that people lose their rights just because they walk in the door.",1581293906,fh5zyy1

Neutral decision maker: the judge. but also the police if the request is coming from outside law enforcement officers. 

Notice: person would be notified before any action is taken.  

An opportunity to be heard: The person would have 48 hours to go before a judge and make a case on why the guns should be taken for less than the 15 days (default) if at all. 


The judge would have already agreed that the guns should be removed. But a person has a chance to make a request and then go back to the court if they lose and that request is denied and the other parties request more than 15 days.

Cholo art is not very rare at all. My problem is when people think of Hispanic art they think of Cholo art.

They don't think of the grand opera like voice of Antonio Aguilar who sang on top of his horse at it danced. 

I have a hard time with Jimmy Baca.

Blood in and Blood Out was not the life I knew. 

Why do white people get cowboy movies and we get Blood In and Blood Out?

I grew up on a ranch. My father never went to jail. No one In my family was in and out of jail. 

We are as far away from that life as you can get. 

We still faced racism but we didn't buckle like cholos did.

I see choloism as saying if you keep calling us dumb will be dumb but why be dumb?

I get that was his life but a lot of white people have the same issues but no one labels them as all dumb thugs. 

 My point about Spain is there is a lot of pro Spanish people in New Mexico who think it's the coolest thing to be from Spain.

How on Earth do these videos counter-attack those beliefs? If anything they confirm them.

""A Norteno from New Mexico"" is really insulting because you found the biggest stereotype on the planet. This dude is a huge embarrassment to our culture. Look at how he talks . Look at what he has done. You think he can hold a conversion abut something science or philosophy related?

Norteno's are suppose to be ranchers, mountain men, Men and women who even if they didn't go to college are still some of the smartest people you have ever met. They have honor and are tough as nails.

The work you show is not brown excellence. Again how is the dude from ""A Norteno from New Mexico"" brown  excellence? If that's the best we can do I am going to die from embarrassment

You're type of art is not rare at all. It's like saying a Pidove Pokemon is rare.

My point is since we have to deal with those demeaning narratives why is your life work being spent to confirm them?

I am sorry but the people in your videos are not heroes. Being a ex junkie does not make you a hero. Realizing at 28 maybe being a street pawn is dumb does not make you a hero.

How many people have they hurt though their stupidity and you want to make them heroes?

How many mothers have they made cry?

You know who the heroes are? The teacher being crushed by the system yet they continue. The mom and dad who give everything they have to their kids. The firemen who risk their lives for others.

Racist over tones of cowboys? Do you know anything about Mexican history? My God how on Earth are you representing the state?

We invented cowboys. It came from Native American and low ranking Mestizos. Cowboys are 100 percent Mexican.

Rodeo is a Spanish word Lasso is a Spanish word. Buckaro is a corruption of Vaquero. Even country music as some of it's roots in Mexican music.

The fact that you don't know that shows how ill informed you are about the very culture you claim to represent.

Oh I must hate my race because I want people to think of Antonio Aguilar instead of some brain dead cholo.

Not all of us are little thugs. Most of the ranchers I know hate little thugs because they have no honor.

My New Mexican cowboy father hated the type of men you are trying to paint as heroes. When I was a little kid he would tell me ""Men like that hurt innocent people, they have no honor, they are the opposite of what it means to be a man""",1581385593,fh9nuhl

2265,2265,boobietassels,"Thanks for the allow thoughtful discussion OP.

Here are my ramblings:

You're right Cholo art is not rare at all but documentary videos of Cholos are. 
This artist is portraying what he knows and has experienced which is Cholo culture.  I think that is OK.

I did not grow up on a ranch, I grew up in the city of Burque where gangs were common and most of the gangs were heavy into cholo culture.  Many native Burqueno's grew up with Cholo's and gangs, it truly is part of our story.  I never joined a gang or was interested in gangs.  My parents kept me away from all of that and kept me focused on school.   However, I have friends who Cholos and they are not bad people because of it.  There are Cholos who aren't out committing crimes believe it or not.  

I think Blood in Blood out has a number of mixed messages, some negative, some positive, and some cautionary.  It provides insight into a lifestyle that most people will never experience and is still a great film.  Those trumpets at the end...

Cowboy culture is chock full of racism and violence and perpetuates plenty of negative stereotypes (old cowboy movies might actually the most racist of all), an artist can choose to focus on the negative, the positive, or both of any culture.

Most of the racism I have faced has really been ignorance.  In whiter parts of the country people often think that the color of my skin makes me the help or the labor.  Which although offensive it is not hateful racism.  I don't think this ignorance stems from what people see in movies, there are plenty of Latinos in the United States that are in fact in service or labor jobs interactive with white people.  So that stereotype is largely from a persons real experience.  That said, I have never in my life been considered a Cholo by anybody of any ethnicity or any background and I look very Hispanic.   

I also think it is annoying when people say they are Spanish when they don't know a single person in Spain, do not speak Spanish, and have not visited Spain.  I get that we have ancestors from Spain but our culture has deviated substantially from Spanish culture.  I also think people who say they are Spanish say so because they have not other culture with which they identify.  They are not Cholos, they are not Mexicans, and American is hardly considered a culture in America.

Who cares about last names, really... I have a somewhat common Spanish last name, some people wear it well others do not.  But I am only related to a very small number of people with that name.  I do not draw any pride or shame from what unrelated people do in general, it doesn't matter what their name is.  This goes for any name, if your last name was Trump would you be ashamed? lol

I would have no problem showing people these videos. I would like for them to get a glimpse of this culture.  I think you would probably be surprised by the reception.  Not everyone is so judgmental or foolish enough to think that everyone in Albuquerque is like this.  And for those that are, there probably isn't anything you can do about it.

For what it's worth I have no stake in this... I am just a random redditor.",1581441760,fhbgebt

I am saying instead of owning the Cholo like it is a point of pride we own something actually worth taking pride in cowboy culture. 

Texas culture is full of racism not cowboy culture.

There are whole groups of New Mexicans who speak Spanish as the go on cattle drives.

There are Native only rodeos. 

I often argue John Wayne was a fake and he was a propagandist. 

Shame a Hispanic person doesn't know that we invented cowboy culture.

Gregory Cortez was a Hispanic Cowboy who was framed for stealing a horse. When a white sheriff shot his brother Gregory Cortez shot and killed the sheriff. 

He then took off running and all of Texas was angry. Looking for him. He became a symbol for a oppressed people. Two cops found him on the run. He killed those cops to and the Hispanic people who had been lynched and buried by the American police cheered him on. He rode on horse back. He was only caught because he was betrayed. 

Even White Texans started to cheer for him. 

He is remembered in a song called named after him but I doubt you know what a  corrido is. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Juan Cortina  was another Hispanic cowboy who stood for the people against their  oppressors. He did it in Brownsville Texas. 

Sad all you know about cowboy culture is what white people want you to know. 

Those Mexican bandits in those movies are the real heroes and the ones fighting for freedom. You wouldn't know that cause when you see a cowboy you see white.

When you see a Hispanic person you see a cholo. 

Sure those men were outlaws but they weren't dumb they weren't stereo types. They were outlaws to a system that was here to destroy them.  

When Cholos commit crimes who gets hurt? Who do they shoot at? Other Hispanics and innocent people.

They have border patrol out on Artesia which makes rentals even more expensive up to $6000 a month for a furnished house. It can sometimes be a little difficult to find a place to live. There really isn’t much to do here you have one Walmart and a few other stores. It is basically two main streets in Artesia, so it takes about 10 min to get anywhere. There are not many choices in town when it comes to shopping or eating. They have a few fast food restaurants and a few local places the meals average around 10$ a plate. You have to drive to either Carlsbad or Roswell for shopping or food even then they are not big towns either. Carlsbad is another oil town while Roswell is famous for the UFO incident and their high crime rate. It can be really difficult to find a good job out here, unless you are oil field and have experience. Even now the oil field can be a little difficult to get into.

oh ya btw, you can also do drugs and have a great life. the two aren't mutually exclusive no matter how bad you'd like that to be so. 

if you bothered to read anything I shared or did any research from primary sources, it would cover these myths about welfare you continue to perpetuate. 

I want humans to act like good fucking humans, it doesn't have shit to do with gender, ethnicity, or religion. being a good human entails giving compassion to all life - especially when that life is suffering. why is that such a difficult concept? 

addiction changes the way that the brain works, it has the power to alter the individual's perception of reality. there is also evidence of a link between a lack of emotional connection in childhood and drug addiction, its not difficult information to find through a search engine.

those people *help*, and we aren't really qualified to discuss what kind of help without a good understanding of things like psychology and biochem. to insinuate that addicts should be cast to the streets and left to die is so incredibly fucked up that it would seem those who act that way might have trouble feeling empathy

One, I have mast cell activation syndrome and have changed environment a lot as a treatment, am more sensitive to a wide variety of environmental triggers than many people , including mold and cyanobacteria.  Cyanobacteria can be present in desert crusts , not just water.  

I feel aversion to the soil in certain areas of New Mexico and I do get a sort of intense ""wired-tired"" thing that I think is related to cyano. I realize people will think this is super out there and I can't currently confirm it with research, but I know others that feel similarly in same areas of New Mexico.  I definitely get this in parts of the Taos area.  Closer to downtown Taos is worse, lots of the outskirts further out feel better but I've even felt this in parts of ranchos de Taos and El Prado. 

However I feel a lot better on most of the high road (especially truchas/trampas) so maybe what I'm saying doesn't fit your experience

Second part , lots of people have talked about Taos having a surreal/weird vibe.  There is a really bloody history with the Pueblo revolts. I'm not sure if I believe in ghosts but *if* they are real Taos probably has some of the worst ones.

2658,2658,GoodNewsisStrong,"2nd, 4th, 6th, and 14th... I’m not trying to get into a 2nd amendment debate but the 2nd amendment for obvious reasons. 

The 4th because the law mandates a seizure not based upon probable cause but based upon ruling on a complaint which can be filed by one private citizen on another private citizen that someone is a danger to themselves or others. This complaint can be based upon something as little as someone recently purchasing a firearm legally (yes, it actually says this in the bill).

Then 6th and 14th because of the violations of due process. The burden of proof is on the defendant to prove that he/she is not a danger to themselves or others. The state/complainant has no burden of proof and does not have to provide any evidence to support their claims.
The defendant only gets one hearing to prove and provide evidence that they’re not a danger to themselves or others. However, like I said earlier, something as little as a recent firearm purchase qualifies as proof that the defendant is a danger to themselves or others. 

If the defendant loses the hearing their firearms are unlawfully seized without probable cause or due process for a period of one year. After that year is up, the defendant gets no notice, however the original complainant receives notice by mail and is sent instructions on how to renew their complaint. If the complainant renews their complaint there is no second hearing, the defendant automatically loses their rights for another year. The complainant has the ability to perpetually renew their complaints and deprive the defendant of their constitutional rights. It is easier for a convicted felon in the State of New Mexico to regain their right to keep and bear arms than it would be for someone who loses one of these hearings.

Not only does the law deprive private citizens of their rights but it also removes qualified immunity for police officers who investigate the complaints and find them unfounded. 

This is a dangerous law that sets a very bad precedent for the depredation of rights guaranteed by the US and New Mexico Constitutions.",1581828142,fhrjoug

In short order, everyone just called her Tutu for the rest of her life. 

When she died back in 2004, my father ordered her headstone.

Which, once I actually visited I realized was totally not true. As far as Albuquerque, I'm sure what you have heard is blown way out of proportion and I dont think you need a concealed carry license to be safe. In fact I wouldn't recommend a gun as a primary self defense option anyway, pepper spray is really a better all around. A lot of Abq depends on the neighborhood and yes, there are some bad ones. But it's not a crazy dangerous place and you shouldn't psych yourself out worrying about it.

And a lot of the city is really, really nice. There are cool old school neighborhoods and cool up and comming neighborhoods. It's a good town.

2750,2750,JoesJourney,"I will likely get downvoted but its just fake internet points anyways... I highly support anyone and everyone who legally can to get a CCL. In terms of force multipliers and effectiveness, its truly hard to beat a gun. But a gun in the hand is only as good as the training that goes behind it. An ordinary CCL class is not enough in my opinion and suggest taking a self defense with a pistol course. Also a couple self defense courses are always good (and super fun/informative.)

Do you need a gun to feel safe in ABQ? No, many people don't and that's their choice. If you feel you need to then that's ultimately your choice. 

 I'm in ABQ about 10 times a year and only had one really weird incident dealing with a drunk guy in old town, so from my own (anecdotal) experience, if you pay attention to the people around you, you should be safe.",1582149988,fi4wqoa

I guess I'm just trying to weigh out the options and how much of a priority this should be. I'm a small dude so a holstered gun on my hip would be more obvious than someone who's 6'1, so I also wouldn't want that to put me in an unfavorable position. Of course I'm going to get good at handling, drills, self defense shooting, etc. I 100% stand by common sense weapons handling.",1582150232,fi4x5jp
2752,2752,john_humano,"Well, I mean it's not a ridiculous concern. But I will say, the fact that you have it is probably the most important first step to staying safe. Basically the theory of self defense starts with awareness, and with letting people around you know that you are aware.  Don't provoke people, but make it clear in any situation that you know what's going on around you, and that you see the people there. And then I think travel with purpose, head up and looking around. And yes I do think pepper spray is a very good idea. I'm a little hesitant about recommending guns for every day kind of self defense, but if you are willing to put in the time to really learn how to use one I don't think it's a bad idea. I'm a gun owner, and have considered getting a cc at times but ultimately I think you are really better served by a pepper spray/stun gun option. And especially pepper spray. Try not to get too worried, or be intimidated. I know that's easier said than done, but it matters and goes along with situational awareness. It dosent really matter what your facial features are, if a potential robber is looking for a victim what they want is someone who seems oblivious, or like they will not put up any resistance. As long as you let people around you know that you are aware of them, and don't make it seem like you are intimidated, you aren't an easy target. But again, Abq is made out to be way worse than it is. I've taken public transportation at night in town and ya, some people are what they are. Drunk or weird or whatever. But I never had anyone try and start trouble, or steal from me or anything like that.",1582150573,fi4xq3u
2753,2753,Ashcashfuggash,"That definitely assuaged some of my more immediate concern. My mom was super hardcore about raising us really aware of our surroundings, and I definitely don't carry myself like I'm afraid or anything like that. I do agree that being armed is a good idea, but logistically it isn't my first choice. At least not in a place with that high of a population density, so when you say that pepper spray is a bit more solid I definitely agree. Of course, a gun is useless at best in the hands of someone who isn't trained well. A lot of my general confusion and anxiety around it was trying to gauge whether or not my awareness and natural alertness would be enough to keep me safe, and if not, where's that line? All in all, I really appreciate you taking the time to comment and answer my questions.",1582150945,fi4ycm7
2754,2754,john_humano,"I hear ya. Well, hopefully you will get a few more respondents because I have to admit, I never lived in Abq. I spent most of my time in the 505 further north, Santa Fe/El Dorado/Pecos mostly.  But my mama lived in Albuquerque for many years and I spent a lot of time down there and really liked it.  For a city that size, a big city by my standards, it's pretty cool. And definitely not super scary or dangerous. Good luck! I hope it works out well for you.

2756,2756,john_humano,"I think this is a totally reasonable take. I'm a middle aged guy, pretty left politics and in favor of responsible gun ownership. I was raised by two cops and I take gun ownership very very seriously. Utimately I genuinely believe for almost all self defense situations there are better options than a gun. But a cc is totally legit as long as you commit. And as I recall from when I looked into it for myself, New Mexico is pretty good about actually making sure you are proficient, knowledgeable and have the range time before they license you.",1582152405,fi50qm9

Though theft is bad in the state, I've never heard anyone say this specifically. Can anyone here confirm or deny this saying is used?

&gt;16% of New Mexicans age 16 and older have a reading level of 1 out of 5, which is equivalent to barely being able to read a book meant for grade school kids.

Not to discount the severity of how poor the education system is here, I feel it should also be taken into account how multilingual this state is. If a good percentage of your population speaks languages like Diné and Spanish at home, I'm sure English-literacy levels will suffer. This is **NOT** to say we should discourage multilingualism, but maybe instead embrace the fact that our English-literacy levels will never be as good as that of, say, New Hampshire's.

## From your own link:

 &gt;But Trump's signing of the bill was partially overshadowed by environmentalist groups angered that his proposed federal budget cuts funding by 31 percent for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. His proposed budget also reduces funding for the U.S. Department of the Interior by 14 percent and completely eliminates a $7,500 tax credit given to owners of electric vehicles. Additionally, the president named a former coal lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, as head of the EPA.

There was a period of over 5 years that I lived in Austin where over 150 people a DAY were moving to the area (tech companies from California moving folks there because taxes were cheaper).

It's completely insane how much housing/real estate shot up and how quickly they gentrified everything.  Mind-blowing.  Don't believe me?  Google it.

His art is a minstrel show I swear. The Guardian isn't written about the Natives who resist drillers or the Vaquero who has kept his land though three governments or the kid born in poverty who escaped though education.

They are talking about the ""E bro I don't know how to properly fire a gun ese but I still got one vato and I hurt a bunch of kids with it ese""

On one hand, if you know someone that is legitimately unhinged and has firearms, you want to be able to inform law enforcement and have them take action before the person goes around shooting people. On the other hand, if you get in an argument with someone, you don’t want them to be able to report you, have all your firearms taken without any justification, then have them show up and shoot you because they know your unarmed. This law is just as easy to abuse as it is to use, so it makes it dangerous.

Also, I'd kinda recommend against Air BNBs as a general rule. Some of it's personal opinion; they kind of kill some communities. But NM also has a lot of great and really affordable lodging. T or C in particular has some great spots centered around the hot springs that are still pretty affordable.

Thank you for all the input 

The Kelly mine I kind of found reallllly randomly o was looking a rock specimen it said it was from there I googled it and was like oh wow we will “sort of” be driving past that way on our road trip and I kinda like took it as a sign from the universe? I hope that doesn’t sound crazy but I know it does - I definitely thought we wouldn’t be able to spend much time but that  we could at least see it and also take it as an opportunity to stretch our legs between driving

I know the itinerary is def packed I  really try to fit a lot into these trips when we get out west just in case we never make it back out this way (I hope we do but ya never know) last year we were in Utah and one day we basically drove 4 hours to Moab did arches in 3 hours then 4 hours to salt lake where we took a red eye home( then I had to take two trains home to Philadelphia from jfk and Jesus Christ I wanted to die I was so tired ) but still worth it to see all we did haha 

I didn’t really think that was about airbnbs in this area though I’ve certainly known the damage that’s happened in areas of New Orleans or Brooklyn for example so that was honestly kind of ignorant of me, so far we are staying in a lot of hotel/ motels which is fine to me it’s kinda whatever place I can find for under 100$

&gt; It&amp;#039;s more like a corporate supergroup: Big Oil meets Big Soda - with a puff of Big Tobacco, responsible for trillions of plastic cigarette butts in the environment every year.

&gt; The Plastics Industry Association, or PLASTICS, is a top trade group headquartered on K Street in Washington, D.C. Hiding its handiwork inside a nesting doll of front groups, PLASTICS has worked to thwart state and municipal bans on single-use plastics.

&gt; This summer, PLASTICS showed off a demonstration project with high-tech, near-infrared scanning machines that can segregate plastics by their polymer type, improving on human sorters who can&amp;#039;t distinguish between two identical-seeming yogurt cups, each made from different plastics.

Also, your comparison shows no understanding of real estate or economics.  You won't get a million restaurants in a small area because the local economy won't support them all.  The ones that serve dishes tailored to local tastes will last.  

Your concept already exists, to some extent.  Food trucks are mobile, so different ones can be in a given area on any given day.

There were some very bizarre comments coming out of the Republican leadership during the session about how we need to show oil and gas that we love them -- the minority floor leader actually tried to coherently argue that oil and gas is ""like a boyfriend that we don't actually like but are keeping around until someone better comes along.""

3631,3631,protekt0r,"Yeah it's folks like you I worry about most in terms of being able to financially survive.  ""Gig"" workers, service industry, retail, etc.  

My only advice is to try and distance yourself as much as possible from customers; sanitize your pen after every use with something like peroxide or alcohol/hand sanitizer.  Suggestion: set the pizza down at the front door with the receipt and pen on top, ring door bell, and back the fuck up.  Like 10-12 feet in case they cough.  Kindly explain why when they come out.  After they close the door, immediately sanitize said pen.  Perhaps store your receipts in a plastic bag - paper can just as easily be a surface this transmits on.  After handling receipts, sanitize hands.  Assume everyone you deliver to is infected.  That's what I would do.

Honestly though, you're just as likely to get it from a co-worker long term if you keep working.  Or someone in your household who isn't being careful.  Or children.

3639,3639,joez37,"&gt;Coronavirus-An individual in Italy- message to the world...need to share far and wide!!  
📷  
I   am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus   crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what   is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today,   not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each   individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter   the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality.  The   only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to   limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior   today.  
If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.  
I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions”  
There   are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First  it  is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks  of  ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads.  There  is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show  symptoms.  
When  Prime Minister  Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60  million people,  would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was  “there is no  more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down,  is a hail  mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not  start to  go down, the system, Italy, will collapse.  
Why?   Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They   have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go   down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands   of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care.   What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the   hospital and only a few ICU places left?  
On   Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to   decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency   room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse.  
There   are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting   the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and   days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply  not  able to care for the patients, when they are not there?  
And   finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to   old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger   and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment.  
You   have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your  country.  Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel  birthday  parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can.  If you have  a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures,  now. Anything  you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in  your  communities – there is a two week incubation period – and if you  do  these things now you can buy your medical system time.  
And   for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all   these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone’s imagination a   week ago.  
Soon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now!

3742,3742,chilebuzz,"I'll take a shot at answering this but I'm not Native American and my knowledge of their culture is not extensive by any means. I've studied Native American culture a bit here and there (college courses and reading on my own), but if someone is more knowledgeable on Native beliefs, please correct any inaccuracies. 

So about your question. Unfortunately, I think it might turn off Native Americans right out of the gates. Native Americans are very diverse and there are as many different beliefs as there are tribes. Your question suggests you think all Native Americans believe in some sort of spirit animal. Honestly, the ""spirit animal"" seems to be more of a Hollywood stereotype that oversimplifies the complexity of most Native American beliefs. What exactly do you mean by ""spirit animal""? Do you mean that each individual human should have some particular animal to which they are connected somehow? I don't think this is the way most tribes think of animals.

For example, for tribes in the Southwest (e.g., Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo), I don't think they really relate with some particular animal. Rather, they associate with their ancestral clans. So if you were to meet a Hopi tribe member and ask ""Hey what's your spirit animal?!"", they'd probably wonder what you're talking about. While there are some clans with animal associations, there are others that are not (e.g., the Water Clan).  And take the Zuni fetishes. While these are represented by particular animals and they can have a connection with an individual person, their role in Zuni beliefs is much more complex than just a personal spirit animal.

Imagine if I came up to you and asked ""Hey, who's your patron saint?"" You might wonder why the hell I'm assuming you believe in patron saints or that you're Catholic for that matter. But most people wouldn't come up and ask you that because we realize there are a lot of different religious beliefs out there and they don't all believe in patron saints.

So I think to approach this question better, you have to make it much more nuanced. If you're curious about a Native American beliefs, well which tribe? Does that tribe believe in anything close to the ""spirit animal"" concept? If so, realize their beliefs are probably more complex than your idea of a spirit animal.

Finally, realize that Native Americans are just like anyone else in that they vary in how much they follow traditional beliefs. Some might follow traditional beliefs, some might follow Christianity, some might have mixed beliefs, and some might not be religious at all. 

So my guess would be that Native Americans might not find your question offensive, but they'd be frustrated that you're lumping all Native Americans together and assuming they believe in spirit animals.",1584054495,fkcjn1t

*****
&gt; In the Comunidad de Madrid region, with 600 official cases and 17 deaths, the true number of cases is likely between 10,000 and 60,000.

&gt; The two ways you can calculate the fatality rate is Deaths/Total Cases and Death/Closed Cases.

&gt; South Korea is the most interesting example, because these 2 numbers are completely disconnected: deaths / total cases is only 0.6%, but deaths / closed cases is a whopping 48%. My take on it is that the country is just extremely cautious: they&amp;#039;re testing everybody, and leaving the cases open for longer.

Sure

&gt;  Most conservative estimates are around 400,00 to 800,000 dead inside of a year. 

Conservative? These numbers assume 30% of the population being infected. It's plausible, but I wouldn't call that conservative. Conservative would be that this thing is actually sort of somewhat contained.

&gt; Further, many more will be hospitalized with severe symptoms and lengthy hospital stays.

Absolutely. At the current pace, we're looking at some cities to be like Northern Italy in about two weeks. It's going to wreck our hospitals and a lot of people will die that DON'T have COVID-19, because the ICUs are swamped and doctors will be working 36 hour days.

&gt; This isn't the end of the world, for sure.

True

&gt; But supply chains are being severely disrupted

Not by the virus. By government lockdowns, perhaps. I don't see any toilet paper manufacturing shortages on the horizon. [The latest numbers out of South Korea](https://i.insider.com/5e6a7b2584159f1962421227?width=1400&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp) are relatively good news for people of working age--as in, the people actually doing manufacturing. Assuming everyone doesn't get this thing *all at once* (pretty unlikely considering the mass social distancing, quarantines, and event cancellations now taking place everywhere, including the U.S.), it's unlikely the entire staff of a manufacturing facility is going to be out sick all at once, and even more unlikely that anyone will die.


&gt; economy is shutting down, layoffs are already happening in certain industries, the markets are selling off, economic stimulus isn't working, and the fed govt. is severely fucked up on response.

That's true. Though I don't know how hoarding toilet paper or bottled water (public utilities aren't going to shut down--they didn't, even, in China, Italy, or Iran) is going to help that. Hoard toilet paper now while you have a job and can afford it? I'd prioritize food over wiping my ass, but OK.

&gt;No matter how you slice it, the economic effects of this are going to be quite harsh for a while.  Things will likely improve in the summer, but then we have to worry about flu season in the fall (again.)  Hopefully, by then, there will be some anti-viral drugs ready to be administered and we can dampen next season's effects.

I completely agree. Vaccines are probably a ways out, but there is a New Jersey company that makes anti-viral drugs that were effective against MERS that are now undergoing trials in Japan and China.",1584166776,fkgo8dx

If you use up your supply wearing them out to go grocery shopping, you won’t have them when you’re taking care of someone who’s contracted the virus and *actually need them*.

I get that saying “don’t wear masks because they don’t help” is quicker and easier than a full explanation like the above, but favoring convenience over the truth on things like this is counterproductive.

Taxpayer subsidies for movie productions are a boondoggle.  They result in very few jobs for locals and mostly benefit profitable production companies and wealthy actors from out of state who don't need subsidies.  Just like taxpayer subsidies for sports stadiums, it's corporate welfare.  Please read the article below before responding.

3943,3943,WikiTextBot,"**Movie production incentives in the United States**

Movie production incentives are tax benefits offered on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States to encourage in-state film production.  These incentives came about in the 1990s in response to the flight of movie productions to other countries such as Canada.  Since then, states have offered increasingly competitive incentives to lure productions away from other states.  The structure, type, and size of the incentives vary from state to state.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Given this novel coronavirus is so ""cunning"", with probably  many infected but asymptomatic people moving around in communities, how  should ordinary citizens protect themselves?**  
&gt;  
&gt;We can only rely on telling everyone to wear a mask, wash their hands  frequently, use alcoholic sanitiser. I had called for everyone to wear a  mask when I was in Beijing, but many people disagreed, saying that the  World Health Organisation (WHO) said healthy people don't need to wear  masks unless they go to crowded places. Nevertheless, if people wear  masks only when they feel sick, then the eight infected people on the  Diamond Princess would have transmitted it to others because they were  not feeling uncomfortable. Wear a mask to protect not only yourself but  also others, because if you are infected but asymptomatic, you could  still stop the spread by wearing a mask.  
&gt;  
&gt;In our experiments previously, we found 100 million virus strands in  just one milliliter of a patient's saliva. Therefore, scenarios with the  potential for exchanging saliva are generally quite dangerous. The  temporary success of virus control in Hong Kong this time is not only  due to population controls, but also contributed by the early advocacy  for mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social distancing. Otherwise, with  such a dense population in Hong Kong, the epidemic would very likely  have spread the same way as in Italy or Daegu in South Korea.

In case you're unaware, ""green chile"" refers to a (technically a few) different kind(s) of capsaicin-containing pepper than jalapeños - same way that Anaheim or ghost peppers are not jalapeños, either. There are a few different varieties (based on growing location &amp; genetic strain) and, as seen in other comments in this post, some small town rivalries of whose heirloom varieties are better.

  


Personally, I consider jalapeños to usually be spicier than green chile, but there are definitely some varieties of chile that can beat a jalapeño in terms of heat, especially if they were harvested just after a dry period. I personally also consider green chile to have a superior flavor to jalapeños, but that's definitely subjective to the taster.",1584383802,fkobccc

I agree in most instances a landlord is in a better position to assume a loss on the property. Heck I have taken a loss the last 2 years on the property because I charge a fair rent and always make repairs in a timely manner even when it means taking money out of my family budget.

I just think it’s crazy to not assume that there are a lot of people in that position.

&gt;	What you are basically saying is that you shouldn’t have to pay rent so I have to spend my check on paying the mortgage on the home you are living in?

Read the petition again - it calls for a halt to rent *and mortgage* payments. Both renters and owners would be out nothing, and banks can handle the delay on mortgages (some banks already allow a single missed payment per year in case or financial emergency). So you, and other landlords, would just be missing out on the *income* from the rent, and not going negative for the month due to the mortgage itself - which seems perfectly fair.

&gt;	Your comment about a landlord should be more prepared is frivolous because you should also have 6 moths of emergency savings too right? Yeah just like the rest of us you probably don’t.

My wife and I did actually have a 6-month emergency fund. We had to use a chunk of it to pay for some other unexpected expenses, so now we only have ~3 months of income in the emergency fund. Sometimes emergencies come one right after the other.

I’m not worried about myself here. I’ll be fine - I’ve already moved to telecommuting, and my wife’s employer is setting up a system for telecommuting as fast as they can, so we hopefully won’t even miss out on much income. I’m worried about people who are less well-prepared than you or me, due to circumstances beyond their control or poor decisions earlier in life that can’t be fixed immediately, and would have to make the choice between feeding their children or feeding their landlord’s wallet this month, and that is absolutely not a place anyone should have to be in.",1584714276,fl0rqlq

The bank is still going to want the money from us. Now we have just created an even worse mess because if they couldn't pay the rent 2 months ago how are they going to pay 2x rent back plus current rent???

What's the measurable(s) for declaring victory over this? Is it when cases decrease? When testing is more prevalent?

I've also been wondering lately what makes *this* the disease we declare war on. Malaria kills far more. What made us ignore SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, H1N1? Why have we normalized influenza? Car crashes are preventable, and they kill far more New Mexicans than COVID-19 has.

Essential services may refer to a class of occupations that have been legislated by a government to have special restrictions in regard to labour actions such as not being allowed to legally strike.

The International Labour Office, a United Nations agency, makes distinctions between an essential service and a minimum service.

582. What is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country.

4370,4370,Yessie555,"I guess it depends on where you're from in Europe, but most foreign folks I've talked to about traveling in the USA get very surprised at how long it takes to get anywhere via driving. It's not too bad on the East Coast, but once you hit the Midwest and Southwest, be prepared to car trips to last at least 2-3 hours (or more), depending on where you're going. 

New Mexico is a very interesting state, what I like to think of as a hidden gem in a sense. Its history is very unique, starting out as Native American land, then blending with Spanish and American culture as time went on. Sometimes it's obvious, but you can see some aspects of this culture mixture really pop out (in good and bad ways), if you know where to look. I have some pretty interesting stories just from walking around various places and observing. 

Depending on what your time-frame and interests are, I can recommend checking out the following NM sites. Listed in no particular order:

1. The Very Large Array (featured in the movie *Contact*)

2. Practically any of the mountains in the state, my favorite are the Sandia Mountains and the Sandia Tram

3. White Sands

4. The Trinity Site (where the first nuclear bomb was detonated, but it might not be open when you visit so you should double check this)

5. Lava tubes and ice cave in the Grants, NM area

6. Carlsbad Caverns (caves are always cool)

7. Roswell (fun if you like campy alien stuff)

8. Acoma Pueblo (HIGHLY recommend this one)

9. Taos Pueblo

10. Albuquerque Old Town

11. The Santa Fe Plaza

12. Meow Wolf (weird art exhibit/experience, hard to describe. But also super busy year round)

13. Chama (you can spend a day riding an old-timey train up into Colorado and back)",1584922138,fl8eya7

4389,4389,decian_falx,"Other poster covered a lot of great things to do.  Here are some things to prepare/expect:

Europe has a great rail system.  The US, outside of a handful of major cities, has almost no rail to speak of - you won't find any public rail from New Mexico to Arizona or to any of the interesting sites listed by the other poster, and many of those things are hundreds of KMs apart, so factor in the cost of renting a car.  American petrol prices are lower than Europe's but vary seasonally.

You will find public rail between Santa Fe, NM to Belen, NM with stops at all the towns in between.  Makes for some decent day trips and Uber can generally get you around in town.  You won't be putting your car on the train, and the train won't be significantly faster or cheaper than driving.

Bring sunglasses.  New Mexico is sunny most of the time.  358 days per year according to Google.

Every US state has a bit of its own culture.  New Mexico's biggest cultural item is green chile.  You have the choice of red, green, or Christmas (both).  My most recent (American) guest found they LOVED green chile breakfast burritos.

Albuquerque is has lots of hot air balloon things.  There are 6-12 hot air balloons visible in the sky almost every single morning, except during one week in the fall for Balloon Fiesta, then it's more like 150 hot air balloons in the sky.

One big thing, though, is if you're on a reservation (like if you visit one of the pueblos), don't take photos as a general rule. A lot of tourists tend to treat Native Americans like kind of zoo animals, so they tend to not really appreciate randos taking pictures. Also, if you visit on a feast day, their religions forbid photographing a lot of the events. Most of the tourist-destination pueblos have rules about photos posted, so just follow those.

Also, to add on to the post you're responding to, the Trinity Site is only open two days a year (it's still an active military installation) so odds are you won't be able to see it, though it is really cool if you can.

Meow Wolf is really awesome, but definitely buy tickets in advance.

Some things I still get very homesick for:
- Green Chile. This took me a couple years to stop craving. 
- the smell of the rain on the desert (sounds cheesy, but it is a totally different smell in NZ)
- the way the sun feels (NZ sun is HARSH due to the hole in the ozone layer)
- the landscape

Some things that make it worth it:
- Holy moly, is NZ beautiful. I am biased but I honestly think NZ and NM are some of the most beautiful places on earth. The mountains here are amazing. And at one point I lived a ten minute walk from a little bay that looked like something out of a postcard. I would walk down to it, jump in the water, then laze on the beach with a beer and a book and there would hardly be anyone around. 
- healthcare and social safety nets that make me feel way more secure
- really good people in my life here. We’ve managed to stick together through disaster and emergency situations, as well as hella good times. 
- great pace of life. In general, people take things a bit slower here than some more crowded parts of the world (a bit like NM). 

One more thing I regret: my accent changed within a year of moving here. Now I don’t sound like a local no matter which bit of the world I’m in. When I go home to NM, people ask me where I’m from and don’t believe I grew up just around the corner.",1585021511,flc6xq5

&gt; 
&gt; **People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?**
&gt; 
&gt; The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
&gt; 
&gt; The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
&gt; 
&gt; There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""",1585089763,fleqzal

""I wanted to be clear: We prioritize the areas.  We do county-by-county analysis.  Based on those analyses on what counties had more than 50 cases, we prioritize the test kits we put out — the 400,000.  And that’s why we’re seeing a 7 percent-plus positivity rate.

&gt;  
&gt;**A:** The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my  opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. This virus is transmitted  by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important  role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always  droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or  presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can  prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting  others.",1585353823,flp8gkn

Santa Fe - more expensive &amp; population is “older”. It’s a tourist destination, which is good &amp; bad.  Small city so no traffic to speak of but lots to do cause of tourism.  Even closer to ski &amp; hike etc than ABQ.

Well, the outdoor life is pretty great. 

If you like hiking, you're golden. Lots of golf and tennis. A brand new aquatic center that is actually really nice and also has basketball courts indoors and aerobics rooms and dance rooms. 

Google Bottomless Lakes. That's fifteen, twenty minutes away. And the drive is MAGICAL. If you like cars, there are lots of great driving roads in the country.

Santa Fe and ABQ are each like three hours away. Taos is just another 45 min or something. 

Ruidoso has great hiking and apparently good skiing (I haven't been). That town is an hour away and is super cute, compared to Roswell. It's like a lot of Rocky Mountain ski towns but small, so:  nice restaurants (ESP compared to Roswell), cute shops, lots of foot traffic, tourists, coffee shops. If I were rich I'd have a weekend house there.

The museums are actually pretty good. They also have an artsist-in-residence program that is very respected; the artsy crowd all goes to the museum-hosted events where the artists give presentations on their work. Those can be fun. 

There are plenty of Mexican restaurants and they are usually good. (Cerritos is probably the town favorite.) In my opinion, no great restaurants whatsoever in this town, though. 

I live in a nice neighborhood and walking is nice. 

Cahoon Park is small but great.

They have a Frisbee golf course:  also small but very nice to have. 

I love the local coffee shop, Stellar.

They have a Starbucks but it has a weird vibe in there.

Depending on where you live, it's a good city for biking. There's a cool new bike repair shop in the back area at Stellar, the cafe. Everyone at Stellar is dynamite; ditto the bike place. They're all either friends or married. It's like a big family. 

And it's the only indie cafe in town. 

Camping is great here.

The best tamales I’ve had are from the Tamale Lady in Socorro.  I think she’s selling them at the swap meet, but it’s not worth a special trip for them.  Yelp is your friend for finding good local food, and that’s where I’d look.  Some of the best food in Socorro is at a run down taco shop that only the locals (and Yelp readers know about).

I always compare us to Arizona because we're right next to each other and similar sizes, but they have four times the cases that we do and 5 times the deaths. Granted, they do have a higher population then us, but I think that overall her order for an early shutdown is doing us good.

I actually just placed a big order at one of my favorite stores over the phone that I can't even pick up until all this is over.

There are checks and balances for a reason.

5191,5191,GreySoulx,"I mean, it's pretty basic epidemiology.... I don't think OP determined it, it's fairly well known.

We can argue the 12 days. I've heard it's more like 18-21 days on average that infected people are shedding the virus, with some outliers still contagious more than 30 days after contracting the virus.... 

Recovery is when you've developed antibodies and no longer shedding viable virus cells... not when you're free of symptoms. Many people will contract this virus and be asymptomatic, but will also eventually create the antibodies they need to fight the virus on their own, and would qualify as ""recovered""

Because of asymptomatic carriers the ""active cases"" and ""recovered"" numbers are going to be VERY difficult to gain any accuracy on until we're able to test a much higher percentage of the population. Where large populations (n&gt;3000) have been mass tested they're finding that 50-70% of the infected population (which is also 50-70% of the total population) are asymptomatic. 

What that means for OP is that it's a decent guess, but there's no telling how accurate it will be until some time well after this is in our past. There will be dissertations written on this for decades, it will be a major course topic for education for 100+ years... people will study SARS-CoV 2 and CoVID-19 for generations.

So we're still adding to the number of infectious people in the state.  But in 5-6 days, (if the new case numbers hold near 40), we may pass the number of new cases with the 12-day-old cases.  That would mean that finally, the number of infectious people would be going down.

A comment argued that 12 days is perhaps not a long enough infectious term.  I hope it is though.

That doesn't mean that in 5 days things will be over  - far from it.  But in New Mexico, it COULD mean that by the end of April the infectious pool might be low enough to see the light from inside this tunnel.

1. We will go bankrupt and unable to have a budget, as well as be forced to shut down programs, and cut jobs. 

2. Since we will have less money, and tons of sun, and wind we will be forced to use what we have, thus forcing us to improve the technology rapidly. (Same happened during the depression when Europe gave us their trade secrets in trade for us producing it for them. Technology jumped on all levels.) 

3. If we have little to no oil industry, that means our current renewable industry will take over as the main source of power and income. 

4. The state, nation, and rest of the world is in a push to get away from oil and use renewable energy sources. It’s a very small industry in comparison, but all big industries started small. 

So if we have no choice but to go that route, we will. We will follow the money, and being that we’re one of the poorest states, and the fact that there’s a big push for renewables here, it will only make it move along faster.",1586020159,fmf56q8

That’s not the way it works. Our primary source of income is from oil and gas, but the state can just say “hey private companies you have to replace our lost revenue source”

&gt; 1. We will go bankrupt and unable to have a budget, as well as be forced to shut down programs, and cut jobs. 

Yes the state will go bankrupt and a lot of people are going to be out of work if Lea/Eddy county quit paying the bills. 

&gt; 2. Since we will have less money, and tons of sun, and wind we will be forced to use what we have, thus forcing us to improve the technology rapidly. (Same happened during the depression when Europe gave us their trade secrets in trade for us producing it for them. Technology jumped on all levels.) 

Again that’s not the way it works. You say “we” like some bureaucrat in Santa Fe invented frac’ing now they just need to invent scaleable super conductors to make wind and solar produced in New Mexico as viable as oil and natural gas produced in New Mexico. 

&gt; 3. If we have little to no oil industry, that means our current renewable industry will take over as the main source of power and income. 

It might be our main source but that doesn’t mean the income will be replaced. You can go from being a orthopedic surgeon to working the register at Allsups. Allsups will be your main source of income that doesn’t mean you make $500K a year. 

&gt; 4. The state, nation, and rest of the world is in a push to get away from oil and use renewable energy sources. It’s a very small industry in comparison, but all big industries started small. 

Every economist in the world disagrees with this. Hence why people call for carbon taxes to inflate the cost of fossil fuels. We are literally seeing the price collapse the other direction. 

&gt; So if we have no choice but to go that route, we will. We will follow the money, and being that we’re one of the poorest states, and the fact that there’s a big push for renewables here, it will only make it move along faster.

Not having other choices doesn’t magically make things better or even keep things the same. Without the oil and gas industry the state is broke. That doesn’t just affect people in San Juan, Eddy, Lea. Your unemployment check in Albuquerque can’t clear with no funds in the bank.",1586021126,fmf6vas

Yes, the plan is to add other counties as people request them, but probably not otherwise, as I'm already spending a decent amount of time per day on this, and adding each county sheet requires some additional time both initially, and in the every day updates. A lot of counties will also make the tabs in the spreadsheet harder to browse, so I want to keep it to the key ones that people using the sheet are interested in for now.

Here's another great source, for tracking projections on how things will look moving forward: [https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections)

My main goal was to create a sheet 100% focused on tracking what's going on in New Mexico, using the latest numbers provided by the NMDOH (those other sites have other sources, which may be more or less accurate). At the moment I feel like it still has some distinct benefits to offer over the other broader sites out there (in particular just having visualizations of the NMDOH data), but as other tools grow and improve, I may find at some point that my sheet isn't relevant anymore (I hear the state is planning to release some graphics at some point as well, though I'm not sure when), but until that point, I'll continue to update and add things every day!",1586126617,fmjaypt

5294,5294,fskhalsa,"As to whether it's *over*\-hyped, that's debatable.

I don't have TV and I don't follow the typical news channels, so I can't speak to if they're blowing things out of proportion or not - however, 630 people died *yesterday* in New York due to coronavirus. In 2017, 58 people died in the Las Vegas shooting; our entire nation mourned, and the media spoke about nothing else for at least two weeks (you can argue whether we should have spoken about it more, or whether we should have done more about it than we did afterwards, but that's a different discussion). If 630 people died tomorrow in NYC due to a shooting, you can bet that would be hyped *a whole lot*. Except that this isn't just happening in New York - *1,344* people died yesterday in the United States alone, and that's just one day out of a trend that is going to continue moving upwards. So I'd argue that if anything, the media may be *under*\-hyping this pandemic, if other newsworthy items are to be used as a measure.

There's also one other thing here - the extent to which people believe this *is* a serious situation (and the media plays a huge role in that), can be **directly** linked to how much worse this gets for us as a nation, and therefore, how many people die from it. So I'd rather everyone have overreacted, and saved thousands or millions of lives, than did too little, and wrote it off as ""not that bad"".",1586127663,fmjcqpg

This is why we need borders as well as tougher laws on the homeless. When shit gets real bad, the common people will understand this and demanded a change. This virus is the biggest blessing in disguise we could ever get.

5315,5315,fskhalsa,"Ok, all updated!

That's an interesting question, with a lot of potential answers:

If you look at the overall growth trend for the # of cases, it is definitely still continuing to go up, and is definitely some sort of exponential growth function. It's fairly early on in the trend however, to really be able to predict where the curve will go.

A more direct answer to your question, if we take it as ""is the rate of new cases per day going up or down"", is that it's varying from day to day, but as of today, the rate went up. We had 81 new cases today, which is an increase of 14.92%, compared with only 51 new cases yesterday, which is an increase of 10.37%. However, the day before that, we had *92* new cases, so we actually went *down-up-down*, at least in the short term.

All of this points to the fact that overall, it's very hard to predict what's likely to happen, especially with the fairly limited amount of data we have to work with (only 26 days so far - not even a month). If you want to play around a bit more with projections and seeing the likely outcomes down the road, I highly recommend checking out one of the websites that is focusing on that, like [this one](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections). Other people much smarter than I are working on this sort of thing, many of them in their studied field and as part of their profession, so I won't claim to do it any better than them. I'm just a numbers geek who's trying to get a sense of what's going on with this thing, and to do what I can to help others have info that might make an impact in fighting it :)

As a final, more straightforward answer to your question, I'd recommend checking out the bar graph chart of the Average Growth Rate Over Time, that I recently added. You can find it by going to the main ""STATEWIDE"" tab on the bottom of the sheet, and scrolling down under the main chart.

As you'll see, the numbers jump up and down from day to day, but if you track the overall trend of the bars, it would appear that our growth rate just *might* be going down slowly over time. Again however, not enough data for any of this to be accurate yet, and as there are so many different influences in the outcomes we're seeing (social distancing, day of the week, outside weather, governmental actions, overall public opinion - and even the increasing number of tests performed), things really are still changing *rapidly* from day to day.",1586132542,fmjl6q4
5316,5316,ratlunchpack,Also I’m thinking that the total recovered numbers are going to jump in the next few days as the total recovered from today looks as though it was probably from that initial batch of 136 reported positive on 3/26. We reported 55 new cases on 3/27 which brought us up to 195 total positive. So I’m thinking we’ll see another good amount of recoveries over this week as well! That’s good news! And seeing our doubling time expand out to 4 days is awesome!,1586132706,fmjlgwi

5318,5318,fskhalsa,"Oh nice!! Our sheets look very similar! So either we're both doing something right, or we're both doing it horribly wrong  😆.

Tracking ""actives"" is the one thing I haven't thought of doing. How are you calculating that number? Just number of cases minus deaths and recoveries? I wonder what the statistical significance of the ""active cases"" is vs. ""total cases"", and which is going to be the more important number to track...

I would love to have your data on goverment measures, if you're willing to send them! It would be interesting to add data to the charts at the inflection points, showing when certain measures were put into effect. I expect there will be a delay (don't know if it's consistent or not) between each measure, and the effect it has. Also problematic is the fact that increasing testing sort of muddies the numbers - as it's hard to tell if an increase in cases (or a lack of decrease) is due to something not having an effect, it having a negative effect, or simply the fact that testing more people means we'll have bigger numbers... It'll be interesting to see though!

I'm actually looking at adding a statistic based on another post in (I think this) subreddit. The post was discussing what is a clear indication that things are getting better, and the idea that if the virus takes *x* days for someone to recover (the example in the post was 12 days), then a sense of when we've ""turned a corner"" can be gleaned by looking at how many new cases we have today, vs. the number of cases *x* (12) days ago. If those cases from *x* days ago recovered today, then if the number of new cases today is less than the number of cases then, then we've turned the corner! Or something like that - I hope I haven't made it more confusing in trying to describe it XD

Regardless, I'm going to add a statistic showing how many cases there were *x* (I think I'm going to use 14) days ago, compared to today. If that ratio is bigger on the left, then we're looking good!!",1586134179,fmjnzgb

5323,5323,ratlunchpack,"Lol I hope we’re both doing it right!! I think in terms of tracking things *right now* looking at active cases is really important. It lets you see how the curve is flattening in real time as well as lets you know what is currently still out there. We started looking at that because I have crippling anxiety sometimes and I was feeling like only reporting total confirmed cases won’t really replicate the curve flattening as well. And yes! “Active” for us is looking at total minus deaths and recoveries!  Now for the long run, looking at total positive cases vs testing vs gov’t measures will helps us make more informed decisions the *next* time something like this happens because it’ll show how effective certain measures were and how well they were implemented. Fun fact: tomorrow will mark 14 days since the stay at home order was issued! 

As far as testing goes, I’ve only been tracking it for a couple of days now, but it looks like no matter how much we’re testing, we’re holding on at 3% positive cases. I don’t know how useful that information will be, but it’s there. Lol

There is a real shortage of these supplies and until hospitals have a surplus of them (so they can treat both infected and non infected people without fear of causing infections) then the private sector should in my opinion opt for home made and more basic masks. If someone I care about gets infected I don't want them going to an under supplied and understaffed hospital where the the health care workers are all sick too.

I think I might go ahead and add a new plot to my chart for that. I'll just need to see how it fits, since the chart already has a lot of data, and I don't want it to get confusing :) But it makes sense to me that that's really a more useful statistic!

And cool! I'll be looking to see if that's reflected in the case numbers in the next few days :) Interesting - I think since the testing #'s and positive case #'s are correlated, the best way to see if there's an effect will be to see if that 3% number starts to go down! Case #'s might continue to go up, as we're testing more and more of our population, but if that's been staying at a pretty steady 3% the whole time, it should theoretically start to go down once the effect of heavier social distancing comes into play! It might be interesting to track the % positive on the graph, actually - I think I'll look into that.

How are you feeling so far about the way our government is handling things? Has it helped alleviate your anxiety at all? Or do you think we really need to be doing more?

I'm generally pretty happy about MLG, and feel like she's doing a *way* better job than just about every other politician out there (just watch her press conferences, she seems *on* it) - but that people in our state are clearly not doing enough in following the guidance, especially on social distancing.

5353,5353,colonelchingles,"I've lived in Farmington for 3 years now, moved from California.

In general the city is divided up by two streets that run east-west.  30th street and 20th street.

The closer you are to 30th, the nicer (and presumably more expensive) the houses and the less crime.  The closer you are to 20th, the less nice the houses.  Below 20th and then you are at a significantly higher risk of crime.  There are exceptions of course (like the new housing developments out near Mesa View), but that's the general rule I've seen.

As you get to the east side of town that generally doesn't apply anymore as 30th and 20th street disappear.  The east side is generally newer than the west side and more commercial (that's where the mall is and most of the new stripmall type developments).  Houses seem decent, though I don't have as much personal experience there.

For me I like the size of Farmington, coming from overcrowded California.  It's small enough where you can get to anywhere you want to go in town in around 10 minutes.  There's almost no traffic (except one week of the year when we host a baseball tournament).  Yet the city is large enough that you aren't really wanting for anything.  There's a museum with rotating exhibits, a downtown with quaint shops for browsing, enough of the big name stores where you can get pretty much anything you need.  We've got a decent hospital in town with (as far as I've seen) fairly competent medical personnel.  We've opened up a new local brewery recently and have pretty good local restaurants (including, oddly enough, decent Thai, Chinese, and Filipino food).  Plus there's good access to the outdoors, hiking, biking, that sort of thing.  And Colorado is close enough for a day trip to the mountains if you get tired of the high desert.

Crime is what it is.  Now in my three years here I've never had any sort of crime, property or violent, happen to me.  Never lost a single package from my porch.  And that's probably a function of where you choose to live.  I've had a coworker who lives south of 20th who had his apartment broken into twice and his car stolen once (which was found later out on the Reservation).  So if you live in a worse part of town, expect crime to happen there.  The official response of the city to the high crime rate in Farmington is that the ""Farmington metro area"" where those crime states come from is much, much larger than the city of Farmington.  According to them, most crime is happening outside of Farmington yet is attributed to Farmington.  You can read an article about it from our newspaper here:

5359,5359,colonelchingles,"Hmmm... I have less information about that.

Farmington does seem fairly religious.  There are a lot of anti-abortion signs put up, and you'll see like 1 or 2 people sometimes picketing a family planning building.

On the other hand we've had 3-4 years of a LGBT parade going down main street.  I've never been to it so I don't know how it is, but it's there.

My general feeling is that people up here are more libertarian than religious.  In other words, so long as you aren't obnoxiously different from everyone else (having lived in Berkeley for four years and San Francisco for three years I can tell you how disastrous the gay parades are there), we let people do their own thing up here.  I get that people here will judge you more on your other attributes rather than something fairly irrelevant (from a social perspective) like homosexuality.

I guess the only other thing I can say about it is how we approach it at my school (I'm a teacher).  Kids are comfortable enough that some of them walk around with rainbow stickers on their binders.  And while kids make fun of other kids for lots of things, I've not really heard of bullying cases involving sexuality.  I have had to have talks with students about using ""gay"" as a negative term (ex: this assignment is so gay) and how that might be hurtful to some of their classmates, but I don't think the students were purposefully using the term fully aware of what they were doing.  When I talk with other school staff about student sexuality issues, it usually boils down to ""well it's against my religion but they are my kids so I love them anyways"".

I will say that as an ethnic minority I got way more racist flak back in California than I ever had here.  That was a little surprising but again I think it's because people around here in a smaller community tend to judge you based on other qualities than superficial ones.  California is just so big that no one really knows anyone else well enough to make judgements other than ones that are skin-deep.",1586195337,fmly5ra

5366,5366,50shadesofgraham,"Grew up and lived there for close to 20 years.

The nicer neighborhoods tend to be on the northern side of town, areas like foothills and the houses around Dustin Park, but there are decent places throughout town. I don't really remember the crime being that bad but I did live in a wealthier neighborhood so my perception might be skewed.

City is pretty slow, and doesn't have much hustle to it. Bars close fairly early compared to larger cities and doesn't have much of a night life. There are few things throughout the year that are pretty cool like the Totah Festival, the rodeo, and Connie Mack World Series. The San Juan College Symphony is good if you're into classical music and there was a good flow of heavy metal bands that came through town while I was there but don't expect any big name artists.

Farmington is more American rural than New Mexican rural than other cities in the state, there's more of a Midwest feel to it since most people there are oil-field or coal and come from that area. So there are New Mexican restaurants but a lot less than you'd expect for the size, it's mostly dominated by chains like Outback and Applebee's which is a bummer. Art also isn't as big as other NM towns which again is unfortunate because there's some really cool stuff in the surrounding areas, especially the Navajo Rez. So if you're looking for a good blend of Mexican, Hispanic, American, and Native cultures Farmington just ain't it.

City politics definitely lean conservative so if you're more progressive be ready for that.

Weather is great, doesn't get much above 100 during the Summer and the monsoon starts in July and goes through August most years. Spring is windy but wonderful if it's calm, Fall is about the same, and Winters are cold but definitely manageable with only a few days of snow.

The best part of Farmington is it's proximity to cool stuff. Durango is an hour up the road and Purgatory is a bit further than that so skiing/snowboarding is accessible, there's tons of BLM land to go explore on bikes or ATVs, world-class fly fishing in the San Juan River, and Navajo Lake for boating and camping. It's also close to Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde and Aztec ruins are right down the road.",1586199508,fmm66ap
5367,5367,colonelchingles,"In my experience, most of the racism that I've gotten around here has actually come from Native Americans, not the Caucasian Americans.  That might be skewed because most of the people I interact with (my students) are Native American, so naturally it may affect my perception.

Prior to this whole virus thing, most of the racist remarks that were made to me by Native Americans were about eating dogs/cats/monkeys (since I'm Chinese), making fun of my last name (though to be fair kids will do that to just about any teacher), and pulling their eyes back to make them seem squinty.  Now with the virus of course I was getting lots of Coronavirus remarks from my kids and comments about eating bats.  It might be a kid-only thing that reflects their immaturity as no adult has ever said things like that to me (Native or otherwise), but at the same time I can't recall a non-Native student ever making a comment like that.

Can't really speak to racism directed towards Native Americans since I'm not Native American.  Only comment that I've heard was a simile for something crooked being compared to an intoxicated Native American.  It was between two Caucasian people.

I guess the difference between California and here is that racism here is... somewhat casual?  It's used more as humour than anything.  Whereas in California it was more of the angry ""go back to your country"" type of racism that is meant to hurt rather than elicit a chuckle.  I guess both can be hurtful, but I would say that around here people don't intend to hurt unlike maybe in other places.",1586200186,fmm7g7j

Personally I think it should be a requirement that before a person is eligible to vote, they need to live for a year in a place politically different from where they grew up.

I'm from a liberal place myself (Berkeley/San Francisco), but when you live with different people it helps to get rid of the ""us/them"" divide.  For example, back in California the view was that ""hey let's transition from fossil fuels and the green jobs will cover everything"".  But when I lived in a place where my neighbours and students were employed in the fossil fuel industry, such liberal views seem impossible to work out (as in there's no way that most of the people working here will ever transition to high tech coding and engineering).

Living in a different place allows you to get a more realistic picture of how the world works and how political policy might affect different people very differently.  It's been a really positive experience for me.",1586203125,fmmd55g

People may have moved on but there were actual townhalls debating whether or not to allow a gay-straight alliance at my high school and some of the things said by people, some of whom I looked up to prior, were disgusting and homophobic to the nth degree. It was a religious town and the purveying belief was very much that being gay was a lifestyle choice.

157,157,colonelchingles,"Well it's like this...

The idea I was exposed to back in California was that communities that got their income from the manufacturing of fossil fuels wouldn't be harmed because there would be the creation of an equal number of better paying green jobs within those communities.  The ""coal miner to coder"" sort of idea.  And before you get to know a community, it sounds like a nice idea and even feasible.

But having moved out here and taught in the community, the facts on the ground become apparent.  Our Four Corner families are great, and the parents of my students are incredibly hard working and give their all so that their kids can have a bright future.  They are kind.  They are caring.

But no way will most of them become coders or computer scientists.

We had an event at our school where parents were invited in to take some of their tests the students take, just so they can get familiar with the curriculum.  And the parents... didn't do so well.

So the ""green job"" idea somehow has these parents, many of whom are in their mid/late 30s to early 40s, going back to school, learning fairly technical skills (on top of basic academic skills), then coming back out to work in a green job and retiring by their mid 60's?

It just doesn't work out.  I don't see a realistic path forward for that.  Maybe their children or grandchildren will be equipped with the necessary skills for a high paying ""green job"", but I think you'll need to wait at least a generation.

What probably will happen is that when the fossil fuel jobs go away, there will be a smaller number of high-paying ""green jobs"" that replace them.  But instead of hiring locals, the ""green jobs"" will be mostly located elsewhere where there is the engineering talent to support it.  Or workers from elsewhere are imported.

Either way, that hits our community hard.  And unless there is an absolute guarantee for every oil field and coal mine worker out here that there will be an equally well-paying ""green job"" that they will be qualified to do, then it will be impossible for the community here to continue as it has.

I mean I hope I'm wrong.  But that's what I mean by getting a broader set of life experiences being useful when looking at public policy.  In this case, an idea sounds good on paper but when you live in the community that will be hit hardest by it and learn what their needs and wants are, the idea can start to seem half-baked.",1586236074,fmnv0h1

From [this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/20/oxfam-worlds-billionaires-richer-than-a-combined-4point6-billion-people.html):

&gt;  
&gt;“If everyone were to sit on their wealth piled up in $100 bills, most of humanity would be sitting on the floor,” its authors said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“A middle-class person in a rich country would be sitting at the height of a chair. The world’s two richest men would be sitting in outer space.”

There's really no reason for these people to have so much money - it's not possible for them to spend it. The rich can only have so many pairs of pants, so many cars, so many houses - consumption and more importantly TIME are finite.

It's so weird to me that in America, where we decided we didn't want to be beholden to a monarch, but now people are seemingly supportive of generational dynasties of absurdly wealthy people. It's not like rich people aren't going to give up on making money if they get to keep a smaller percentage of it.

""Billionaries aren't just a policy failure, they are the embodiment of immorality.  You can't be a billionaire and a good person, despite what their astroturfing PR teams on reddit may try to tell you for some of the 'good ones'.

It's literally impossible to accumulate that much wealth without the mass exploitation of others and the profits their labor generated.  Not to mention the exploitation of the earth until it's uninhabitable for human life.

George Washington was the richest man in the country when the US was founded, and he ""only"" had today's equivalent of 500 million.  That wouldn't even get him in the room with some of these ghouls today.

If people only understood just how obscenely rich these monsters were, they wouldn't be able to show their face in society while millions suffer.  I like to use the analogy of a staircase, with each step on the staircase representing $100,000 of net worth.  That's several years of working wages saved up for tens of millions of  Americans:

* HALF of people in the united states are on the **base** or the very **1st step**.  Almost 200 million people who can't even get one step up in this system.

* Those households at the 80th percentile, richer than 4/5 Americans, are on the **5th step**.  That's about five seconds of walking to get up there.  

* Those with more money than 90% of fellow Americans, millionaires who we consider our upper-middle class professional class and live more than comfortably, are on the **11th** step.  A few more seconds of walking up from that previous middle-class step.  Most Americans won't even come close to accumulating this much over an entire lifetime of working.

* **A billionaire is ten thousand steps up the staircase**.  That's enough to walk up five Empire State buildings.  That's almost three hours of walking non-stop.  You think they care about the petty squabbles of anyone on those first few steps or so?  From these heights they couldn't tell the difference even if they wanted to.  And yet those who've maybe ascended or were born on the first few dozen steps think they identify with this group as a class.

* And Jeff Bezos?  He's so high up it only makes sense to describe his staircase in distance.  His stairs take him up **133 miles**.  That's more than halfway to the space station.  That's more than **24 consecutive Mt. Everest's** stacked on top of each other.  It would take walking, non-stop, no sleep, over two weeks to ascend that high, each single step worth more than five poverty-level families in America combined.

I think that the point there graffiti was trying to make was that the exceedingly wealthy (for the same of argument, let's say he's talking about billionaire or above) have perogies greatly from the opportunities afforded to them by this great nation. As such they are uniquely placed to be able to assist said nation with the process of recovering from this calamity. I also think it would be fair to say that they have moral (not legal, don't worry. No lawyers are getting involved, yet) obligation to invest in the same infrastructure that enabled them to flourish.

And given that (if you will allow me to pick one example that, I think, is indicative of a larger issue) Jeff Bezos paid not one thin dime in income tax last year, it's quite possible that he could afford to buy a few ventilators for some hospitals.

- The scenarios which you are describing with Alabama is a bad scenario to look at. The surrounding circumstances were illegal aliens were afraid to work because of immigration laws. 

It didn't fail. It didn't have enough time to work. If it is illegal to hire illegal aliens, which it is, but if the law was enforced... then good ol Brian Cash would have to pay his LEGAL American workers more money to do the same job.  You're actually proving my point. It also wasn't millions of dollars it was $100,000. From one dude. And if he was a smart business man, he would have paid Americans more money and taken a smaller profit. Greed fucked this dude over. If you take illegal aliens out of the picture the economy would be stronger and people would have more money.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/14/alabama-immigration-law-workers


- ""In 2017, the total cost of illegal immigration for the United States – at the federal, state, and local levels – was approximately $116 billion. FAIR arrived at this number by subtracting the tax revenue paid by illegal aliens – about $19 billion – from the total economic impact of illegal migration, $134.9 billion. Evidence shows that the tax payments made by illegal aliens fail to cover the costs of the many services they consume. A large percentage of illegal aliens who work in the underground economy frequently avoid paying any income tax at all. Many illegal aliens actually receive a net cash profit through refundable tax credit programs.""

Bill Gates had wealthy parents and access to cutting-edge technology, as do most ""self-made"" billionaires.

The program was gutted because it was economically disastrous and unconstitutional. It wasn't just one guy who suffered economically. Many businesses reported that there was an initial surge in hiring following the mass exodus of undocumented immigrants, however these replacement workers quit pretty much within the week because of the low pay and excruciating conditions. These are not good jobs that these people are having to work.

I agree that employers should be held accountable for these sorts of hiring practices and they absolutely should be paying higher wages, but the consequences of hiring immigrant labor always falls on the people and never the employer.

We want everyone to pay taxes, yes. But I don't demonize the people who take tax breaks that the government created.

Did you reach out to the governors and complain to them? They seem to be the problem more than Jeff is. 

I would assume that when you do your taxes, you take every deduction available to you. Jeff does the same, and since he keeps re-investing in his business (eve though you think it's all given to him) It's his re-investment that keeps his tax bill low.

As for why I'm not angry at the government...Oh, don't you worry, buddy. I've got anger to spare for both. But let me ask you a question. Where do you think a government of the people ends and wealthy citizens begins? Because if I can afford to pour millions into a senator's pockets for their re-election campaign, then my word carries a BIT more weight than that of the average citizen.  If for no other reason than that I can have sit-down meetings with said senators.

So, when that Senator, for the good of the nation, puts forth tax breaks that HEAVILY favor the guy who just gave him a million bucks, I get mad. And, hold onto your pants, 'cause this'll be a mind-freak, I get mad at BOTH the Senator AND the Billionaire. See, that's how anger works.

Because those tax breaks your talking about didn't just become a thing because a freak whirlwind picked up a quill and wrote them into law. Actual people made actual decisions. And those decisions, one after another, built up to the point where the manager of a Chevron pays more in taxes than Michael Wirth (And, if you didn't know the CEO of Chevron off the top of your head, don't worry. I had to look it up, too.).

And yes. I'm sure that you, like most Americans, take advantage of what loopholes that you can when it comes time to pony up to Uncle Sam. But you know what you didn't do? Start a Super-Pac to anonymously slush **literally unknown** millions of dollars into the pockets of judges, senators, and congresspeople. With enough cash left over to fund at least two or three lobbying groups.

And Bezos isn't some genius. He had ONE good idea. centralize online shipping into one site. And, for a time, that was nice. But if you think no-one else came up with that idea around the same time, you're fooling yourself. If you think he didn't do some shady shit to keep other people with the same idea from being able to prosper or even stay afloat, you're delusional.

And if you think those precious jobs he ""created"" in exchange for all his taxable income are anything better than slave labor, then I cordially invite you to walk into any of his warehouses and shake some hands. Or even just breathe deep.

You DO know that he's refusing to properly disinfect his warehouses when one of the employees brings in Covid-19, right? Which is a thing that they don't *really* have a choice over if they want to continue to eat indoors, so don't go laying the blame at the feet of the workers. He's not closing those warehouses for even a day. He's making people come into work the day after their worksite is infected. But, hey. That's probably just a ""Healthcare Loophole"", right?

&gt;If for no other reason than that I can have sit-down meetings with said senators.

You are missing a huge point in this. Senators don't give one shit about Jeff Bezos. What they care about are the jobs Jeff is creating. So yes, they listen to him when he asks for tax breaks in return for jobs.  That is a very crucial piece you seem to be skipping over.  

&gt;I get mad at BOTH the Senator AND the Billionaire.

So when you see a senator that gives Jeff $10 million dollars to employ thousands of people that generate $10 billion wages that in turn stimulate the economy, that's somehow bad?  First they don't give Bezos a check. What they do is say you don't have to pay your property tax for X amount of years, or at a reduced rate. In return they get an economic boost.  Now personally, I hate that game, but I understand it. The governor makes a call to give away future revenue which it currently is not collecting in order to get a large investment in their community. It makes sense for the governor.  But Bezos was going to spend the money anyway, they didn't need a break. But the governor wanted the future revenue so the offer Jeff a deal. 

&gt;And Bezos isn't some genius. He had ONE good idea. centralize online shipping into one site. And, for a time, that was nice. But if you think no-one else came up with that idea around the same time, you're fooling yourself. If you think he didn't do some shady shit to keep other people with the same idea from being able to prosper or even stay afloat, you're delusional.

This is how business works. Bill Gates was the same, but look at him now.  His billions are being invested wisely, and in my view better than the government would have invested it had they taxed Gates to keep him from being a billionaire. 

&gt;And if you think those precious jobs he ""created"" in exchange for all his taxable income are anything better than slave labor, then I cordially invite you to walk into any of his warehouses and shake some hands.

And if there was another company that paid better, those employees would be out the door in a heartbeat.  People work there voluntarily. Where are all the companies that compete?

No, I don't follow what amazon does. I personally think amazon has gone downhill over the years. This last paragraph says a lot about Jeff, and it isn't good.

Refusing to acknowledge that and shifting instead to ""but he pays other taxes"" comes off as disingenuous, at best. Are you going to point out that he pays sales tax, next? 

Point is, he wormed his way out of paying his fair share of federal tax. And he did it by throwing more cash than you and I combined will ever physically see at a bunch of senators. The argument that ""It's business as usual"" is still as poor an argument as it was when it was phrased as ""But all the COOL kids are doing it!"". The fact that our government, yours and mine, is vulnerable to this kind of manipulation makes me quite angry. I'm honestly perplexed that it doesn't bother you.

And no duh, senators don't care personally about Bezos. The man has less personal charisma than those drones he keeps trying to replace people with. I...again...JUST said that they care about the SHIT-TONS OF CASH that he and others like him pour into all these little Super-Pacs. Guess you blinked and ""skipped over"" that, huh? 

As for the jobs he's creating, he DOES want to replace all of his workers with drones. It's not a secret. Google ""Amazon"" and ""Drones"". Seriously. It's not a liberal mind-trap, or whatever. 

Bezos was a Cherry-pick. I admitted as much the first time I mentioned him. But it doesn't really count as a logical fallacy because he IS pretty damned indicative of the larger problem I'm trying to discuss. There are no companies that pay better because companies only care about profits. Sounds callous, I know. But it's how they thrive. So they will squeeze every cent they can out of their workers. That's why the Victorian era was kinda' shitty if you weren't rich. That's why unions came into existence. No-one else was standing up to those in power.

But, again, Bezos is a symptom of a larger problem. There aren't any better competitors because...as I have said before and I'm starting to realize I will have to say many more times before you stop ignoring the point, If there were any better competitors, Bezos would buy them out, drown out their ability to compete, legislate them out of existence, or, ONCE AGAIN, pay to have the laws changed so they can't freely operate. This business as usual. And it's why YOU will never be rich.

And if he treated his people better, I wouldn't have nearly as much moral high ground when discussing him. I would gladly take that hit to live in that world. Sadly, I don't see that happening.

It's hard to succeed when you're cut off from trade by one of the largest nations in the world or your political rivals all of a sudden have a lot more money and guns than you. It's not an imaginary boogeyman, it is a proven fact that the United States government has suppressed Unions, labor organization, and other leftist thinking. The Sedition Act of 1918, the Red Scare, McCarthyism. Even going back to the founding fathers, the US electoral system was designed to limit the power of the common man. ""If an employer treats you poorly, leave."" That doesn't work without a sufficient support system. The people treated the worst are the people who most need the job that they have. They don't have the option of leaving without putting themselves and any financial dependents in serious trouble.

&gt; Although all scorpions produce venom, the Arizona bark scorpion is the only species that can cause serious medical illness and even death.  The bark scorpion can be found in the southwest corner of New Mexico.  If you live in an area that the Arizona bark scorpion inhabits, you are likely to find them in your home.",1586405834,fmv4fzb

403,403,themostrepublic,"We do have the bad ones in New Mexico. If it was a small scorpion or a golden brown scorpion there may be cause for concern. Dogs will actually often alert or point in the presence of a scorpion, as they do present danger to the dog. The venom is usually not a problem for a human sized animal, but for a dog it could be. The dog could be allergic to the venom, even if it's not fatal venom. You could probably give your dog a full dose of children's Benadryl. Additionally, the wound site itself is liable to become infected or necrotic. You'll need to be able to see the wound site to monitor for infection or necrosis. You may need to trim or shave the fur back to do this. It's important to wash the wound with mild soap and cool water. You can also run the wound under cool water to help with the pain. Dogs don't do well with human pain relievers, which is why vets use Rimadyl. You may need to visit a vet just to get some of that, as the dog is definitely in a lot a lot of pain. Monitor for abnormal behavior: passing out, drooling, lethargy, uncontrollable urination/defecation, these are obvious signs of it worsening. Finally, you may need to tweeze the stinger out, if it's not already out, this will definitely lead to infection/necrosis. You don't need to worry, I'm sure your dog will be just fine, but there is cause for concern and vigilance. All my best to you and your pup",1586406902,fmv5vvl

&gt; All call centers situated in New Mexico are directed to reduce their in-person workforce by 100%. This includes any call center that is part of or supports an essential business.

So on one hand they hired more people, but they have to work from home per the governor.

That said, most national parks are so damn big there's usually no practical way you'd be able to fly in over the interesting bits from outside the park's boundary. That's why I mentioned the Chacoan Outliers which are only a few hundred acres of NPS land. The surrounding land is mostly Navajo, and I don't know their current position on drone flying.

Otherwise, just basic safety rules are important. It's best to have someone else there keeping an eye on you if possible, but if not, I'd go so far as to arrange check-ins by phone since climbing on roofs always comes with a risk of accidents. Make sure your ladder is placed firmly in such a way that it won't shift or move while you climb on it. Wear well-fitted shoes with grippy soles, no sandals or shit. Also, if you're not used to working on roofs, be aware that it gets hot up there all fast, even on fairly mild days.

Also, if you have asthma or any respiratory issues, I highly recommend a face mask (if you can get one in these weird times). You shouldn't need it for most stuff, but depending on how exactly your cooler was winterized, there can be a lot of mold in the pads when you go to replace them. I've even had pros leave those in to get all moldy and shit, so be prepared for that possibility.

If you really want to support people returning to normal consumption, you need to reassure them that 1) they're not going to get sick and 2) even if they do we have adequate medical supplies, space, and personnel to take care of them.

First it's a cost-benefit consideration.  As I suggested (though I could always be wrong), not a lot of people will come out in the midst of the pandemic if numbers are higher than ever.  From a business perspective it might not even make sense to flip on the lights and pay employees if they're only going to get a tiny number of customers.  It also might not make sense if the cost to the community to treat the newly infected or deal with a 2d wave infection outweighs the meager economic activity generated by businesses.

Second, the ""freedom"" of people to decide rushes up against the ""freedom"" of other people not to get sick.  Rights are only absolute if you live on an island all by yourself... but in a society we necessarily limit our rights in exchange for the ability to live with others.  In other words I don't have the freedom to discharge a firearm in whatever direction I want... because there could be someone standing there.

People are already not following the rules or taking it seriously, so more people are dying in Farmington than ever should have - the town is rural and spread out, social distancing should be far easier there than in an urban setting.  The answer to that situation isn't to encourage them to be even more relaxed and spread even more infection by making the rules less strict.  It's so weird how eager that community seems to be when it comes to killing each other.

The Navajo Nation is taking the right approach - people weren't following the rules and it got bad so they made the rules stricter and are locking everyone down.  To go the opposite route and instead give people more freedom to spread the infection is the evil option.",1587077953,fnmto4l

759,759,colonelchingles,"I'm not sure if you've ever been up here, but Farmington proper is most definitely not spread out or rural.  Just take a satellite image from Google Maps... most of Farmington is fairly suburban.  No different than a community in the Albuquerque suburbs.

Now if you want actual data on how Farmington and the Navajo Nation are doing, here's the facts:

San Juan County Cases Minus Navajo Nation: 89 (229-140)  
SJC Population Minus NN in SJC (2010 census): 102,310 (130,044-27,734)  
Percent SJC Minus NN Infected: 0.087%

Navajo Nation Cases: 140  
NN Population in SJC (2010 Census): 27,734  
Percent NN in SJC Infected: 0.505%

Bernalillo County Cases: 491  
Bernalillo Population (2010 census): 662,564  
Percent Bernalillo Infected: 0.074%

So what the data is telling us is that Farmington (and Aztec, Bloomfield, other areas off reservation) itself is actually doing pretty good, with rates of infection that are fairly similar to other parts of New Mexico like Albuquerque (0.087% versus 0.074% respectively).  It is a sad mischaracterisation to suggest that the people of Farmington are not taking the virus seriously or practising social distancing.  The data clearly shows that most of San Juan County is keeping infection rates low.

However the data also shows that the problem lies in the Navajo Nation.  There, an individual looks to be 5-6 times more likely to be infected than someone living off of the reservation in a neighbouring community like Farmington.  That's what is raising the overall case count in San Juan County.  The problem is in Shiprock, not in Farmington.

And no, it's not a race thing.  The non-Navajo Nation data for SJC includes a lot of ethnic Navajo who are doing a great job of not getting sick just as everyone else is... as I explained before, the root cause is poverty on the Navajo Nation and their lack of development paired with a quasi-democratic governance system.  I would actually argue the opposite of your conclusion; it is clear from the data that Farmington actually has done things right and something has gone very, very wrong on the Navajo Nation.  Their relatively extreme recent steps are only a response to mistakes made earlier.",1587147973,fnpm8jt

821,821,OPsDearOldMother,"I don't think I have enough details here to make a judgement. If the jail is really refusing to detain violent offenders as the mayor's quote suggests then that's pretty messed up.

On the other hand I think we need to release as many people being held on cash bail as we can within reason, not just because of the pandemic, but because holding people in jail based on their ability to pay is wrong. If there's no reason to believe someone will skip out on their court date or pose a serious threat to society there's no reason they should be locked up before they even have a fair trial.",1587233112,fnt21r8

823,823,OPsDearOldMother,"I've had a great experience at the University of New Mexico. It's in Albuquerque which is the largest city in New Mexico at almost a million people in the metro. It's really affordable as far as colleges go. I know a lot of people from California and Colorado who come here because even the out of state tuition is cheaper then their instate.

Other places are:
NM tech: a great engineering school in a tiny town about an hour south of ABQ.

NM State: pretty similar to UNM with a focus on agriculture. It's located in the Southern part of the state in Las Cruces which is about 30 minutes away from El Paso.

NM Highlands: A really small college located in a pretty interesting small town about an hour and a half NE of ABQ called Las Vegas. There's a lot of history and natural beauty in the area but the school itself isn't anything special academically.

For Texas I can't say as much. University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M are both super good schools, better than what you'd find in NM dependent on what you're studying but also much pricier. Texas Tech and University of Houston are also good options about on par with UNM. Rice University in Houston is an incredible school, nearly on par with an ivy league college, but very expensive and hard to get into.",1587235920,fnt75yt
824,824,pynappels,"I live in Santa Fe and I've read some great advice on reddit about moving here and to Las Cruces. Not necessarily a comparison but great advice on moving to either. If you run a search and in the r/SantaFe forums 'moving to \_\_\_\_\_"" I think you'll find some very informative threads. That said, I don't think that amount of salary will get you great family housing in Santa Fe. I don't have kids but I'd guess the public schools are going to be a toss-up. Particularly because, as I understand it, SF schools are zoned to benefit the more expensive houses east of Saint Francis and it would be difficult to find a place for a family within your likely budget range.",1587236089,fnt7h06
825,825,MurrayDakota,"Thanks, but there is no family (I'm asking about the schools because I'd like to live in a place that values general education) and there is no salary.  The $60K to $75K is just income.  

Housing budget would be under $500K, but ideally much lower than that.  

For example, $350K seems to get you a lovely place in Las Cruces but not much in Santa Fe.  Honestly, housing is the biggest issue I'm running up against--finding a non-quirky place in Santa Fe that comes with a garage and a decently updated kitchen for less than $500K is near impossible, but not remotely a problem in Las Cruces.",1587236817,fnt8sbg
826,826,OPsDearOldMother,"I'm more familiar with Santa Fe as I've really just passed through Cruces but I can say a few things.

As you've probably seen the housing market in Santa Fe has been jacked up by really wealthy people who retire or have second homes there. Id say the biggest economy in Santa Fe is actually tourism, which may be a plus or minus depending on you.

That being said there's tons of really cool historical buildings and museums (including a world class opera) in Santa Fe that Las Cruces doesn't really have. El Paso does attract some good entertainers though and it's only ~30 minutes away from Cruces, but Albuquerque attracts pretty much the same acts and it's only an hour south of Santa Fe.

I will say for outdoors I'd take Santa Fe over Cruces in a heartbeat but it depends on whether you like desert or mountains. Santa Fe is nearly 3000' higher in elevation than Cruces so it has much colder winters and milder summers, Las Cruces gets very hot in the summer. Consequently Santa Fe is much greener than Cruces but its still likely much drier than you're used to. If you like skiing the Santa Fe ski basin is only 30 minutes from town and there's also tons of ancient ruins, ghost towns, alpine lakes, and mountain peaks to explore right outta town.

I'd pick Santa Fe personally but it all depends on if you can afford it. A really good compromise would be looking at Albuquerque, but I understand the city gets a bad rap (somewhat justifiably, somewhat unfairly) for having a crime problem.",1587238031,fntaxtp

828,828,IlariaStormrage,Santa Fe has higher prices on food and everything else. It's better to live in Cruces or ABQ at this point. Just stay out of the war zone in ABQ. Look at crime heat maps for the safest areas to live.,1587238703,fntc4pk
